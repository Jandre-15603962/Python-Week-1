adventure of the engineers thumb the adventure of the noble bachelor the adventure of the beryl coronet the adventure of the copper beeches a scandal in bohemia i to sherlock holmes she is always the woman i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name in his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler all emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind he was i take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position he never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer they were admirable things for the observerexcellent for drawing the veil from mens motives and actions but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own highpower lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his and yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late irene adler of dubious and questionable memory i had seen little of holmes lately my marriage had drifted us away from each other my own complete happiness and the homecentred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in baker street buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature he was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings of his summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland beyond these signs of his activity however which i merely shared with all the readers of the daily press i knew little of my former friend and companion one nightit was on the twentieth of march 1888i was returning from a journey to a patient for i had now returned to civil practice when my way led me through baker street as i passed the wellremembered door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as i looked up i saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him to me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story he was at work again he had risen out of his drugcreated dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own his manner was not effusive it seldom was but he was glad i think to see me with hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion wedlock suits you he remarked i think watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you seven i answered indeed i should have thought a little more just a trifle more i fancy watson and in practice again i observe you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness then how do you know i see it i deduce it how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl my dear holmes said i this is too much you would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as i have changed my clothes i cant imagine how you deduce it as to mary jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again i fail to see how you work it out he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together it is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant bootslitting specimen of the london slavey as to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his tophat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction when i hear you give your reasons i remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yours quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair you see but you do not observe the distinction is clear for example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room frequently how often well some hundreds of times then how many are there how many i dont know quite so you have not observed and yet you have seen that is just my point now i know that there are seventeen steps because i have both seen and observed by the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this he threw over a sheet of thick pinktinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table it came by the last post said he read it aloud the note was undated and without either signature or address there will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight oclock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated this account of you we have from all quarters received be in your chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask this is indeed a mystery i remarked what do you imagine that it means i have no data yet it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts but the note itself what do you deduce from it i carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was written the man who wrote it was presumably well to do i remarked endeavouring to imitate my companions processes such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet it is peculiarly strong and stiff peculiarthat is the very word said holmes it is not an english paper at all hold it up to the light i did so and saw a large e with a small g a p and a large g with a small t woven into the texture of the paper what do you make of that asked holmes the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather not at all the g with the small t stands for gesellschaft which is the german for company it is a customary contraction like our co p of course stands for papier now for the eg let us glance at our continental gazetteer he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves eglow eglonitzhere we are egria it is in a germanspeaking countryin bohemia not far from carlsbad remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerous glassfactories and papermills ha ha my boy what do you make of that his eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette the paper was made in bohemia i said precisely and the man who wrote the note is a german do you note the peculiar construction of the sentencethis account of you we have from all quarters received a frenchman or russian could not have written that it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs it only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face and here he comes if i am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell holmes whistled a pair by the sound said he yes he continued glancing out of the window a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties a hundred and fifty guineas apiece theres money in this case watson if there is nothing else i think that i had better go holmes not a bit doctor stay where you are i am lost without my boswell and this promises to be interesting it would be a pity to miss it but your client never mind him i may want your help and so may he here he comes sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attention a slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately outside the door then there was a loud and authoritative tap come in said holmes a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height with the chest and limbs of a hercules his dress was rich with a richness which would in england be looked upon as akin to bad taste heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his doublebreasted coat while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flamecoloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance he carried a broadbrimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face extending down past the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy you had my note he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked german accent i told you that i would call he looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to address pray take a seat said holmes this is my friend and colleague dr watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases whom have i the honour to address you may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman i understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance if not i should much prefer to communicate with you alone i rose to go but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair it is both or none said he you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me the count shrugged his broad shoulders then i must begin said he by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history i promise said holmes and i you will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is not exactly my own i was aware of it said holmes dryly the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia i was also aware of that murmured holmes settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client if your majesty would condescend to state your case he remarked i should be better able to advise you the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation then with a gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground you are right he cried i am the king why should i attempt to conceal it why indeed murmured holmes your majesty had not spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein grand duke of casselfelstein and hereditary king of bohemia but you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power i have come incognito from prague for the purpose of consulting you then pray consult said holmes shutting his eyes once more the facts are briefly these some five years ago during a lengthy visit to warsaw i made the acquaintance of the wellknown adventuress irene adler the name is no doubt familiar to you kindly look her up in my index doctor murmured holmes without opening his eyes for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staffcommander who had written a monograph upon the deepsea fishes let me see said holmes hum born in new jersey in the year 1858 contraltohum la scala hum prima donna imperial opera of warsawyes retired from operatic stageha living in londonquite so your majesty as i understand became entangled with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back precisely so but how was there a secret marriage none no legal papers or certificates none then i fail to follow your majesty if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity there is the writing pooh pooh forgery my private notepaper stolen my own seal imitated my photograph bought we were both in the photograph oh dear that is very bad your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion i was madinsane you have compromised yourself seriously i was only crown prince then i was young i am but thirty now it must be recovered we have tried and failed your majesty must pay it must be bought she will not sell stolen then five attempts have been made twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house once we diverted her luggage when she travelled twice she has been waylaid there has been no result no sign of it absolutely none holmes laughed it is quite a pretty little problem said he but a very serious one to me returned the king reproachfully very indeed and what does she propose to do with the photograph to ruin me but how i am about to be married so i have heard to clotilde lothman von saxemeningen second daughter of the king of scandinavia you may know the strict principles of her family she is herself the very soul of delicacy a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end and irene adler threatens to send them the photograph and she will do it i know that she will do it you do not know her but she has a soul of steel she has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men rather than i should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not gonone you are sure that she has not sent it yet i am sure and why because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed that will be next monday oh then we have three days yet said holmes with a yawn that is very fortunate as i have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present your majesty will of course stay in london for the present certainly you will find me at the langham under the name of the count von kramm then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress pray do so i shall be all anxiety then as to money you have carte blanche absolutely i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph and for present expenses the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes he said holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook and handed it to him and mademoiselles address he asked is briony lodge serpentine avenue st johns wood holmes took a note of it one other question said he was the photograph a cabinet it was then goodnight your majesty and i trust that we shall soon have some good news for you and goodnight watson he added as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street if you will be good enough to call tomorrow afternoon at three oclock i should like to chat this little matter over with you ii at three oclock precisely i was at baker street but holmes had not yet returned the landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight oclock in the morning i sat down beside the fire however with the intention of awaiting him however long he might be i was already deeply interested in his inquiry for though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which i have already recorded still the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own indeed apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow the quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head it was close upon four before the door opened and a drunkenlooking groom illkempt and sidewhiskered with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room accustomed as i was to my friends amazing powers in the use of disguises i had to look three times before i was certain that it was indeed he with a nod he vanished into the bedroom whence he emerged in five minutes tweedsuited and respectable as of old putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes well really he cried and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the chair what is it its quite too funny i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning or what i ended by doing i cant imagine i suppose that you have been watching the habits and perhaps the house of miss irene adler quite so but the sequel was rather unusual i will tell you however i left the house a little after eight oclock this morning in the character of a groom out of work there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men be one of them and you will know all that there is to know i soon found briony lodge it is a bijou villa with a garden at the back but built out in front right up to the road two stories chubb lock to the door large sittingroom on the right side well furnished with long windows almost to the floor and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coachhouse i walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view but without noting anything else of interest i then lounged down the street and found as i expected that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received in exchange twopence a glass of halfandhalf two fills of shag tobacco and as much information as i could desire about miss adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested but whose biographies i was compelled to listen to and what of irene adler i asked oh she has turned all the mens heads down in that part she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet so say the serpentinemews to a man she lives quietly sings at concerts drives out at five every day and returns at seven sharp for dinner seldom goes out at other times except when she sings has only one male visitor but a good deal of him he is dark handsome and dashing never calls less than once a day and often twice he is a mr godfrey norton of the inner temple see the advantages of a cabman as a confidant they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentinemews and knew all about him when i had listened to all they had to tell i began to walk up and down near briony lodge once more and to think over my plan of campaign this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter he was a lawyer that sounded ominous what was the relation between them and what the object of his repeated visits was she his client his friend or his mistress if the former she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping if the latter it was less likely on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge or turn my attention to the gentlemans chambers in the temple it was a delicate point and it widened the field of my inquiry i fear that i bore you with these details but i have to let you see my little difficulties if you are to understand the situation i am following you closely i answered i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to briony lodge and a gentleman sprang out he was a remarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustachedevidently the man of whom i had heard he appeared to be in a great hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home he was in the house about half an hour and i could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sittingroom pacing up and down talking excitedly and waving his arms of her i could see nothing presently he emerged looking even more flurried than before as he stepped up to the cab he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly drive like the devil he shouted first to gross hankeys in regent street and then to the church of st monica in the edgeware road half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes away they went and i was just wondering whether i should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau the coachman with his coat only halfbuttoned and his tie under his ear while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles it hadnt pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment but she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might die for the church of st monica john she cried and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes this was quite too good to lose watson i was just balancing whether i should run for it or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street the driver looked twice at such a shabby fare but i jumped in before he could object the church of st monica said i and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes it was twentyfive minutes to twelve and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind my cabby drove fast i dont think i ever drove faster but the others were there before us the cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived i paid the man and hurried into the church there was not a soul there save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman who seemed to be expostulating with them they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar i lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church suddenly to my surprise the three at the altar faced round to me and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me thank god he cried youll do come come what then i asked come man come only three minutes or it wont be legal i was halfdragged up to the altar and before i knew where i was i found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear and vouching for things of which i knew nothing and generally assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler spinster to godfrey norton bachelor it was all done in an instant and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other while the clergyman beamed on me in front it was the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my life and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now it seems that there had been some informality about their license that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man the bride gave me a sovereign and i mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion this is a very unexpected turn of affairs said i and what then well i found my plans very seriously menaced it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part at the church door however they separated he driving back to the temple and she to her own house i shall drive out in the park at five as usual she said as she left him i heard no more they drove away in different directions and i went off to make my own arrangements which are some cold beef and a glass of beer he answered ringing the bell i have been too busy to think of food and i am likely to be busier still this evening by the way doctor i shall want your cooperation i shall be delighted you dont mind breaking the law not in the least nor running a chance of arrest not in a good cause oh the cause is excellent then i am your man i was sure that i might rely on you but what is it you wish when mrs turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you now he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided i must discuss it while i eat for i have not much time it is nearly five now in two hours we must be on the scene of action miss irene or madame rather returns from her drive at seven we must be at briony lodge to meet her and what then you must leave that to me i have already arranged what is to occur there is only one point on which i must insist you must not interfere come what may you understand i am to be neutral to do nothing whatever there will probably be some small unpleasantness do not join in it it will end in my being conveyed into the house four or five minutes afterwards the sittingroom window will open you are to station yourself close to that open window yes you are to watch me for i will be visible to you yes and when i raise my handsoyou will throw into the room what i give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire you quite follow me entirely it is nothing very formidable he said taking a long cigarshaped roll from his pocket it is an ordinary plumbers smokerocket fitted with a cap at either end to make it selflighting your task is confined to that when you raise your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people you may then walk to the end of the street and i will rejoin you in ten minutes i hope that i have made myself clear i am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you and at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street precisely then you may entirely rely on me that is excellent i think perhaps it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simpleminded nonconformist clergyman his broad black hat his baggy trousers his white tie his sympathetic smile and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr john hare alone could have equalled it was not merely that holmes changed his costume his expression his manner his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed the stage lost a fine actor even as science lost an acute reasoner when he became a specialist in crime it was a quarter past six when we left baker street and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue it was already dusk and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge waiting for the coming of its occupant the house was just such as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes succinct description but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected on the contrary for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood it was remarkably animated there was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner a scissorsgrinder with his wheel two guardsmen who were flirting with a nursegirl and several welldressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths you see remarked holmes as we paced to and fro in front of the house this marriage rather simplifies matters the photograph becomes a doubleedged weapon now the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess now the question is where are we to find the photograph where indeed it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her it is cabinet size too large for easy concealment about a womans dress she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched two attempts of the sort have already been made we may take it then that she does not carry it about with her where then her banker or her lawyer there is that double possibility but i am inclined to think neither women are naturally secretive and they like to do their own secreting why should she hand it over to anyone else she could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man besides remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days it must be where she can lay her hands upon it it must be in her own house but it has twice been burgled pshaw they did not know how to look but how will you look i will not look what then i will get her to show me but she will refuse she will not be able to but i hear the rumble of wheels it is her carriage now carry out my orders to the letter as he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue it was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of briony lodge as it pulled up one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper but was elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up with the same intention a fierce quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen who took sides with one of the loungers and by the scissorsgrinder who was equally hot upon the other side a blow was struck and in an instant the lady who had stepped from her carriage was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood running freely down his face at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other while a number of better dressed people who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man irene adler as i will still call her had hurried up the steps but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall looking back into the street is the poor gentleman much hurt she asked he is dead cried several voices no no theres life in him shouted another but hell be gone before you can get him to hospital hes a brave fellow said a woman they would have had the ladys purse and watch if it hadnt been for him they were a gang and a rough one too ah hes breathing now he cant lie in the street may we bring him in marm surely bring him into the sittingroom there is a comfortable sofa this way please slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the principal room while i still observed the proceedings from my post by the window the lamps had been lit but the blinds had not been drawn so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch i do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was conspiring or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me i hardened my heart and took the smokerocket from under my ulster after all i thought we are not injuring her we are but preventing her from injuring another holmes had sat up upon the couch and i saw him motion like a man who is in need of air a maid rushed across and threw open the window at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of fire the word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators well dressed and illgentlemen ostlers and servant maidsjoined in a general shriek of fire thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window i caught a glimpse of rushing figures and a moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner of the street and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friends arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road you did it very nicely doctor he remarked nothing could have been better it is all right you have the photograph i know where it is and how did you find out she showed me as i told you she would i am still in the dark i do not wish to make a mystery said he laughing the matter was perfectly simple you of course saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice they were all engaged for the evening i guessed as much then when the row broke out i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand i rushed forward fell down clapped my hand to my face and became a piteous spectacle it is an old trick that also i could fathom then they carried me in she was bound to have me in what else could she do and into her sittingroom which was the very room which i suspected it lay between that and her bedroom and i was determined to see which they laid me on a couch i motioned for air they were compelled to open the window and you had your chance how did that help you it was allimportant when a woman thinks that her house is on fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most it is a perfectly overpowering impulse and i have more than once taken advantage of it in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me and also in the arnsworth castle business a married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches for her jewelbox now it was clear to me that our lady of today had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of she would rush to secure it the alarm of fire was admirably done the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel she responded beautifully the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bellpull she was there in an instant and i caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out when i cried out that it was a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed from the room and i have not seen her since i rose and making my excuses escaped from the house i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait a little overprecipitance may ruin all and now i asked our quest is practically finished i shall call with the king tomorrow and with you if you care to come with us we will be shown into the sittingroom to wait for the lady but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands and when will you call at eight in the morning she will not be up so that we shall have a clear field besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits i must wire to the king without delay we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door he was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said goodnight mister sherlock holmes there were several people on the pavement at the time but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by ive heard that voice before said holmes staring down the dimly lit street now i wonder who the deuce that could have been iii i slept at baker street that night and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room you have really got it he cried grasping sherlock holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face not yet but you have hopes i have hopes then come i am all impatience to be gone we must have a cab no my brougham is waiting then that will simplify matters we descended and started off once more for briony lodge irene adler is married remarked holmes married when yesterday but to whom to an english lawyer named norton but she could not love him i am in hopes that she does and why in hopes because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance if the lady loves her husband she does not love your majesty if she does not love your majesty there is no reason why she should interfere with your majestys plan it is true and yet well i wish she had been of my own station what a queen she would have made he relapsed into a moody silence which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue the door of briony lodge was open and an elderly woman stood upon the steps she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham mr sherlock holmes i believe said she i am mr holmes answered my companion looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze indeed my mistress told me that you were likely to call she left this morning with her husband by the 515 train from charing cross for the continent what sherlock holmes staggered back white with chagrin and surprise do you mean that she has left england never to return and the papers asked the king hoarsely all is lost we shall see he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawingroom followed by the king and myself the furniture was scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and open drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight holmes rushed at the bellpull tore back a small sliding shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out a photograph and a letter the photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress the letter was superscribed to sherlock holmes esq to be left till called for my friend tore it open and we all three read it together it was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way my dear mr sherlock holmes you really did it very well you took me in completely until after the alarm of fire i had not a suspicion but then when i found how i had betrayed myself i began to think i had been warned against you months ago i had been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly be you and your address had been given me yet with all this you made me reveal what you wanted to know even after i became suspicious i found it hard to think evil of such a dear kind old clergyman but you know i have been trained as an actress myself male costume is nothing new to me i often take advantage of the freedom which it gives i sent john the coachman to watch you ran upstairs got into my walking clothes as i call them and came down just as you departed well i followed you to your door and so made sure that i was really an object of interest to the celebrated mr sherlock holmes then i rather imprudently wished you goodnight and started for the temple to see my husband we both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by so formidable an antagonist so you will find the nest empty when you call tomorrow as to the photograph your client may rest in peace i love and am loved by a better man than he the king may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged i keep it only to safeguard myself and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future i leave a photograph which he might care to possess and i remain dear mr sherlock holmes very truly yours irene norton ne adler what a womanoh what a woman cried the king of bohemia when we had all three read this epistle did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was would she not have made an admirable queen is it not a pity that she was not on my level from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your majesty said holmes coldly i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majestys business to a more successful conclusion on the contrary my dear sir cried the king nothing could be more successful i know that her word is inviolate the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire i am glad to hear your majesty say so i am immensely indebted to you pray tell me in what way i can reward you this ring he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand your majesty has something which i should value even more highly said holmes you have but to name it this photograph the king stared at him in amazement irenes photograph he cried certainly if you wish it i thank your majesty then there is no more to be done in the matter i have the honour to wish you a very good morning he bowed and turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him he set off in my company for his chambers and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of bohemia and how the best plans of mr sherlock holmes were beaten by a womans wit he used to make merry over the cleverness of women but i have not heard him do it of late and when he speaks of irene adler or when he refers to her photograph it is always under the honourable title of the woman the redheaded league i had called upon my friend mr sherlock holmes one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout floridfaced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair with an apology for my intrusion i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me you could not possibly have come at a better time my dear watson he said cordially i was afraid that you were engaged so i am very much so then i can wait in the next room not at all this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting with a quick little questioning glance from his small fatencircled eyes try the settee said holmes relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together as was his custom when in judicial moods i know my dear watson that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you will excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me i observed you will remember that i remarked the other day just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting you did doctor but none the less you must come round to my view for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right now mr jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative i ask you not merely because my friend dr watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips as a rule when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are to the best of my belief unique the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat as he glanced down the advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee i took a good look at the man and endeavoured after the fashion of my companion to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance i did not gain very much however by my inspection our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman obese pompous and slow he wore rather baggy grey shepherds check trousers a not overclean black frockcoat unbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament a frayed tophat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him altogether look as i would there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features sherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour that he takes snuff that he is a freemason that he has been in china and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately i can deduce nothing else mr jabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion how in the name of goodfortune did you know all that mr holmes he asked how did you know for example that i did manual labour its as true as gospel for i began as a ships carpenter your hands my dear sir your right hand is quite a size larger than your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more developed well the snuff then and the freemasonry i wont insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use an arcandcompass breastpin ah of course i forgot that but the writing what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk well but china the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject that trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china when in addition i see a chinese coin hanging from your watchchain the matter becomes even more simple mr jabez wilson laughed heavily well i never said he i thought at first that you had done something clever but i see that there was nothing in it after all i begin to think watson said holmes that i make a mistake in explaining omne ignotum pro magnifico you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid can you not find the advertisement mr wilson yes i have got it now he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column here it is this is what began it all you just read it for yourself sir i took the paper from him and read as follows to the redheaded league on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins of lebanon pennsylvania u s a there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of 4 a week for purely nominal services all redheaded men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twentyone years are eligible apply in person on monday at eleven oclock to duncan ross at the offices of the league 7 popes court fleet street what on earth does this mean i ejaculated after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcement holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when in high spirits it is a little off the beaten track isnt it said he and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself your household and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes you will first make a note doctor of the paper and the date it is the morning chronicle of april 27 1890 just two months ago very good now mr wilson well it is just as i have been telling you mr sherlock holmes said jabez wilson mopping his forehead i have a small pawnbrokers business at coburg square near the city its not a very large affair and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living i used to be able to keep two assistants but now i only keep one and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business what is the name of this obliging youth asked sherlock holmes his name is vincent spaulding and hes not such a youth either its hard to say his age i should not wish a smarter assistant mr holmes and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him but after all if he is satisfied why should i put ideas in his head why indeed you seem most fortunate in having an employ who comes under the full market price it is not a common experience among employers in this age i dont know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement oh he has his faults too said mr wilson never was such a fellow for photography snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures that is his main fault but on the whole hes a good worker theres no vice in him he is still with you i presume yes sir he and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place cleanthats all i have in the house for i am a widower and never had any family we live very quietly sir the three of us and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts if we do nothing more the first thing that put us out was that advertisement spaulding he came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says i wish to the lord mr wilson that i was a redheaded man why that i asks why says he heres another vacancy on the league of the redheaded men its worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men so that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money if my hair would only change colour heres a nice little crib all ready for me to step into why what is it then i asked you see mr holmes i am a very stayathome man and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the doormat in that way i didnt know much of what was going on outside and i was always glad of a bit of news have you never heard of the league of the redheaded men he asked with his eyes open never why i wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies and what are they worth i asked oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slight and it need not interfere very much with ones other occupations well you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears for the business has not been over good for some years and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy tell me all about it said i well said he showing me the advertisement you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy and there is the address where you should apply for particulars as far as i can make out the league was founded by an american millionaire ezekiah hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways he was himself redheaded and he had a great sympathy for all redheaded men so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to do but said i there would be millions of redheaded men who would apply not so many as you might think he answered you see it is really confined to londoners and to grown men this american had started from london when he was young and he wanted to do the old town a good turn then again i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but real bright blazing fiery red now if you cared to apply mr wilson you would just walk in but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves that my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me he was very willing to have a holiday so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement i never hope to see such a sight as that again mr holmes from north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement fleet street was choked with redheaded folk and popes court looked like a costers orange barrow i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement every shade of colour they werestraw lemon orange brick irishsetter liver clay but as spaulding said there were not many who had the real vivid flamecoloured tint when i saw how many were waiting i would have given it up in despair but spaulding would not hear of it how he did it i could not imagine but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office there was a double stream upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back dejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office your experience has been a most entertaining one remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff pray continue your very interesting statement there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine he said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all however when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he might have a private word with us this is mr jabez wilson said my assistant and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league and he is admirably suited for it the other answered he has every requirement i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine he took a step backward cocked his head on one side and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful then suddenly he plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on my success it would be injustice to hesitate said he you will however i am sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution with that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until i yelled with the pain there is water in your eyes said he as he released me i perceive that all is as it should be but we have to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint i could tell you tales of cobblers wax which would disgust you with human nature he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled a groan of disappointment came up from below and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a redhead to be seen except my own and that of the manager my name said he is mr duncan ross and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor are you a married man mr wilson have you a family i answered that i had not his face fell immediately dear me he said gravely that is very serious indeed i am sorry to hear you say that the fund was of course for the propagation and spread of the redheads as well as for their maintenance it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor my face lengthened at this mr holmes for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right in the case of another said he the objection might be fatal but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties well it is a little awkward for i have a business already said i oh never mind about that mr wilson said vincent spaulding i should be able to look after that for you what would be the hours i asked ten to two now a pawnbrokers business is mostly done of an evening mr holmes especially thursday and friday evening which is just before payday so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings besides i knew that my assistant was a good man and that he would see to anything that turned up that would suit me very well said i and the pay is 4 a week and the work is purely nominal what do you call purely nominal well you have to be in the office or at least in the building the whole time if you leave you forfeit your whole position forever the will is very clear upon that point you dont comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time its only four hours a day and i should not think of leaving said i no excuse will avail said mr duncan ross neither sickness nor business nor anything else there you must stay or you lose your billet and the work is to copy out the encyclopaedia britannica there is the first volume of it in that press you must find your own ink pens and blottingpaper but we provide this table and chair will you be ready tomorrow certainly i answered then goodbye mr jabez wilson and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do i was so pleased at my own good fortune well i thought over the matter all day and by evening i was in low spirits again for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what its object might be i could not imagine it seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the encyclopaedia britannica vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing however in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow so i bought a penny bottle of ink and with a quillpen and seven sheets of foolscap paper i started off for popes court well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible the table was set out ready for me and mr duncan ross was there to see that i got fairly to work he started me off upon the letter a and then he left me but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me at two oclock he bade me goodday complimented me upon the amount that i had written and locked the door of the office after me this went on day after day mr holmes and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my weeks work it was the same next week and the same the week after every morning i was there at ten and every afternoon i left at two by degrees mr duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning and then after a time he did not come in at all still of course i never dared to leave the room for an instant for i was not sure when he might come and the billet was such a good one and suited me so well that i would not risk the loss of it eight weeks passed away like this and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the bs before very long it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings and then suddenly the whole business came to an end to an end yes sir and no later than this morning i went to my work as usual at ten oclock but the door was shut and locked with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack here it is and you can read for yourself he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of notepaper it read in this fashion the redheaded league is dissolved october 9 1890 sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter i cannot see that there is anything very funny cried our client flushing up to the roots of his flaming head if you can do nothing better than laugh at me i can go elsewhere no no cried holmes shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen i really wouldnt miss your case for the world it is most refreshingly unusual but there is if you will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door i was staggered sir i did not know what to do then i called at the offices round but none of them seemed to know anything about it finally i went to the landlord who is an accountant living on the ground floor and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the redheaded league he said that he had never heard of any such body then i asked him who mr duncan ross was he answered that the name was new to him well said i the gentleman at no 4 what the redheaded man yes oh said he his name was william morris he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready he moved out yesterday where could i find him oh at his new offices he did tell me the address yes 17 king edward street near st pauls i started off mr holmes but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial kneecaps and no one in it had ever heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross and what did you do then asked holmes i went home to saxecoburg square and i took the advice of my assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post but that was not quite good enough mr holmes i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i came right away to you and you did very wisely said holmes your case is an exceedingly remarkable one and i shall be happy to look into it from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear grave enough said mr jabez wilson why i have lost four pound a week as far as you are personally concerned remarked holmes i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league on the contrary you are as i understand richer by some 30 to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a you have lost nothing by them no sir but i want to find out about them and who they are and what their object was in playing this prankif it was a prankupon me it was a pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them two and thirty pounds we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you and first one or two questions mr wilson this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisementhow long had he been with you about a month then how did he come in answer to an advertisement was he the only applicant no i had a dozen why did you pick him because he was handy and would come cheap at half wages in fact yes what is he like this vincent spaulding small stoutbuilt very quick in his ways no hair on his face though hes not short of thirty has a white splash of acid upon his forehead holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement i thought as much said he have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings yes sir he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad hum said holmes sinking back in deep thought he is still with you oh yes sir i have only just left him and has your business been attended to in your absence nothing to complain of sir theres never very much to do of a morning that will do mr wilson i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two today is saturday and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion well watson said holmes when our visitor had left us what do you make of it all i make nothing of it i answered frankly it is a most mysterious business as a rule said holmes the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be it is your commonplace featureless crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify but i must be prompt over this matter what are you going to do then i asked to smoke he answered it is quite a three pipe problem and i beg that you wont speak to me for fifty minutes he curled himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his hawklike nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep and indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece sarasate plays at the st jamess hall this afternoon he remarked what do you think watson could your patients spare you for a few hours i have nothing to do today my practice is never very absorbing then put on your hat and come i am going through the city first and we can have some lunch on the way i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than italian or french it is introspective and i want to introspect come along we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate and a short walk took us to saxecoburg square the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning it was a poky little shabbygenteel place where four lines of dingy twostoried brick houses looked out into a small railedin enclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smokeladen and uncongenial atmosphere three gilt balls and a brown board with jabez wilson in white letters upon a corner house announced the place where our redheaded client carried on his business sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids then he walked slowly up the street and then down again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses finally he returned to the pawnbrokers and having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went up to the door and knocked it was instantly opened by a brightlooking cleanshaven young fellow who asked him to step in thank you said holmes i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand third right fourth left answered the assistant promptly closing the door smart fellow that observed holmes as we walked away he is in my judgment the fourth smartest man in london and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third i have known something of him before evidently said i mr wilsons assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the redheaded league i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him not him what then the knees of his trousers and what did you see what i expected to see why did you beat the pavement my dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk we are spies in an enemys country we know something of saxecoburg square let us now explore the parts which lie behind it the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxecoburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted let me see said holmes standing at the corner and glancing along the line i should like just to remember the order of the houses here it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london there is mortimers the tobacconist the little newspaper shop the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank the vegetarian restaurant and mcfarlanes carriagebuilding depot that carries us right on to the other block and now doctor weve done our work so its time we had some play a sandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violinland where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no redheaded clients to vex us with their conundrums my friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuthhound holmes the relentless keenwitted readyhanded criminal agent as it was possible to conceive in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented as i have often thought the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy and as i knew well he was never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his blackletter editions then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st jamess hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down you want to go home no doubt doctor he remarked as we emerged yes it would be as well and i have some business to do which will take some hours this business at coburg square is serious why serious a considerable crime is in contemplation i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it but today being saturday rather complicates matters i shall want your help tonight at what time ten will be early enough i shall be at baker street at ten very well and i say doctor there may be some little danger so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket he waved his hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the crowd i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes here i had heard what he had heard i had seen what he had seen and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all from the extraordinary story of the redheaded copier of the encyclopaedia down to the visit to saxecoburg square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me what was this nocturnal expedition and why should i go armed where were we going and what were we to do i had the hint from holmes that this smoothfaced pawnbrokers assistant was a formidable mana man who might play a deep game i tried to puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation it was a quarterpast nine when i started from home and made my way across the park and so through oxford street to baker street two hansoms were standing at the door and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above on entering his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men one of whom i recognised as peter jones the official police agent while the other was a long thin sadfaced man with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frockcoat ha our party is complete said holmes buttoning up his peajacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack watson i think you know mr jones of scotland yard let me introduce you to mr merryweather who is to be our companion in tonights adventure were hunting in couples again doctor you see said jones in his consequential way our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase observed mr merryweather gloomily you may place considerable confidence in mr holmes sir said the police agent loftily he has his own little methods which are if he wont mind my saying so just a little too theoretical and fantastic but he has the makings of a detective in him it is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official force oh if you say so mr jones it is all right said the stranger with deference still i confess that i miss my rubber it is the first saturday night for sevenandtwenty years that i have not had my rubber i think you will find said sherlock holmes that you will play for a higher stake tonight than you have ever done yet and that the play will be more exciting for you mr merryweather the stake will be some 30000 and for you jones it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands john clay the murderer thief smasher and forger hes a young man mr merryweather but he is at the head of his profession and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london hes a remarkable man is young john clay his grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to eton and oxford his brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself hell crack a crib in scotland one week and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next ive been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you tonight ive had one or two little turns also with mr john clay and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession it is past ten however and quite time that we started if you two will take the first hansom watson and i will follow in the second sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gaslit streets until we emerged into farrington street we are close there now my friend remarked this fellow merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter i thought it as well to have jones with us also he is not a bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession he has one positive virtue he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone here we are and they are waiting for us we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning our cabs were dismissed and following the guidance of mr merryweather we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door which he opened for us within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate this also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate mr merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us down a dark earthsmelling passage and so after opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him nor from below said mr merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor why dear me it sounds quite hollow he remarked looking up in surprise i must really ask you to be a little more quiet said holmes severely you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his face while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket we have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape we are at present doctoras no doubt you have divinedin the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks mr merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present it is our french gold whispered the director we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it your french gold yes we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30000 napoleons from the bank of france it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar the crate upon which i sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject which were very well justified observed holmes and now it is time that we arranged our little plans i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head in the meantime mr merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern and sit in the dark i am afraid so i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a partie carre you might have your rubber after all but i see that the enemys preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light and first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darknesssuch an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moments notice to me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault they have but one retreat whispered holmes that is back through the house into saxecoburg square i hope that you have done what i asked you jones i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent and wait what a time it seemed from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us my limbs were weary and stiff for i feared to change my position yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions but i could distinguish the deeper heavier inbreath of the bulky jones from the thin sighing note of the bank director from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line and then without any warning or sound a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared a white almost womanly hand which felt about in the centre of the little area of light for a minute or more the hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones its disappearance however was but momentary with a rending tearing sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon its side and left a square gaping hole through which streamed the light of a lantern over the edge there peeped a cleancut boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with a hand on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulderhigh and waisthigh until one knee rested upon the edge in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion lithe and small like himself with a pale face and a shock of very red hair its all clear he whispered have you the chisel and the bags great scott jump archie jump and ill swing for it sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar the other dived down the hole and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver but holmes hunting crop came down on the mans wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor its no use john clay said holmes blandly you have no chance at all so i see the other answered with the utmost coolness i fancy that my pal is all right though i see you have got his coattails there are three men waiting for him at the door said holmes oh indeed you seem to have done the thing very completely i must compliment you and i you holmes answered your redheaded idea was very new and effective youll see your pal again presently said jones hes quicker at climbing down holes than i am just hold out while i fix the derbies i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins have the goodness also when you address me always to say sir and please all right said jones with a stare and a snigger well would you please sir march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the policestation that is better said john clay serenely he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective really mr holmes said mr merryweather as we followed them from the cellar i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr john clay said holmes i have been at some small expense over this matter which i shall expect the bank to refund but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the redheaded league you see watson he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league and the copying of the encyclopaedia must be to get this not overbright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day it was a curious way of managing it but really it would be difficult to suggest a better the method was no doubt suggested to clays ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplices hair the 4 a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands they put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation but how could you guess what the motive was had there been women in the house i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue that however was out of the question the mans business was a small one and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations and such an expenditure as they were at it must then be something out of the house what could it be i thought of the assistants fondness for photography and his trick of vanishing into the cellar the cellar there was the end of this tangled clue then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london he was doing something in the cellarsomething which took many hours a day for months on end what could it be once more i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick i was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind it was not in front then i rang the bell and as i hoped the assistant answered it we have had some skirmishes but we had never set eyes upon each other before i hardly looked at his face his knees were what i wished to see you must yourself have remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were they spoke of those hours of burrowing the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for i walked round the corner saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friends premises and felt that i had solved my problem when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors with the result that you have seen and how could you tell that they would make their attempt tonight i asked well when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr jabez wilsons presencein other words that they had completed their tunnel but it was essential that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the bullion might be removed saturday would suit them better than any other day as it would give them two days for their escape for all these reasons i expected them to come tonight you reasoned it out beautifully i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration it is so long a chain and yet every link rings true it saved me from ennui he answered yawning alas i already feel it closing in upon me my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence these little problems help me to do so and you are a benefactor of the race said i he shrugged his shoulders well perhaps after all it is of some little use he remarked lhomme cest rienloeuvre cest tout as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand a case of identity my dear fellow said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at baker street life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent we would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence if we could fly out of that window hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the strange coincidences the plannings the crosspurposes the wonderful chains of events working through generations and leading to the most outr results it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable and yet i am not convinced of it i answered the cases which come to light in the papers are as a rule bald enough and vulgar enough we have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits and yet the result is it must be confessed neither fascinating nor artistic a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect remarked holmes this is wanting in the police report where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter depend upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace i smiled and shook my head i can quite understand your thinking so i said of course in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled throughout three continents you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre but herei picked up the morning paper from the groundlet us put it to a practical test here is the first heading upon which i come a husbands cruelty to his wife there is half a column of print but i know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me there is of course the other woman the drink the push the blow the bruise the sympathetic sister or landlady the crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your argument said holmes taking the paper and glancing his eye down it this is the dundas separation case and as it happens i was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it the husband was a teetotaler there was no other woman and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average storyteller take a pinch of snuff doctor and acknowledge that i have scored over you in your example he held out his snuffbox of old gold with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon it ah said he i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the irene adler papers and the ring i asked glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger it was from the reigning family of holland though the matter in which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems and have you any on hand just now i asked with interest some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of interest they are important you understand without being interesting indeed i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation the larger crimes are apt to be the simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as a rule is the motive in these cases save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from marseilles there is nothing which presents any features of interest it is possible however that i may have something better before very many minutes are over for this is one of my clients or i am much mistaken he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutraltinted london street looking over his shoulder i saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck and a large curling red feather in a broadbrimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her ear from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous hesitating fashion at our windows while her body oscillated backward and forward and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons suddenly with a plunge as of the swimmer who leaves the bank she hurried across the road and we heard the sharp clang of the bell i have seen those symptoms before said holmes throwing his cigarette into the fire oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur she would like advice but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication and yet even here we may discriminate when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire here we may take it that there is a love matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or grieved but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts as he spoke there was a tap at the door and the boy in buttons entered to announce miss mary sutherland while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a fullsailed merchantman behind a tiny pilot boat sherlock holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable and having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him do you not find he said that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting i did at first she answered but now i know where the letters are without looking then suddenly realising the full purport of his words she gave a violent start and looked up with fear and astonishment upon her broad goodhumoured face youve heard about me mr holmes she cried else how could you know all that never mind said holmes laughing it is my business to know things perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook if not why should you come to consult me i came to you sir because i heard of you from mrs etherege whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead oh mr holmes i wish you would do as much for me im not rich but still i have a hundred a year in my own right besides the little that i make by the machine and i would give it all to know what has become of mr hosmer angel why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry asked sherlock holmes with his fingertips together and his eyes to the ceiling again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary sutherland yes i did bang out of the house she said for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr windibankthat is my fathertook it all he would not go to the police and he would not go to you and so at last as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done it made me mad and i just on with my things and came right away to you your father said holmes your stepfather surely since the name is different yes my stepfather i call him father though it sounds funny too for he is only five years and two months older than myself and your mother is alive oh yes mother is alive and well i wasnt best pleased mr holmes when she married again so soon after fathers death and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself father was a plumber in the tottenham court road and he left a tidy business behind him which mother carried on with mr hardy the foreman but when mr windibank came he made her sell the business for he was very superior being a traveller in wines they got 4700 for the goodwill and interest which wasnt near as much as father could have got if he had been alive i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative but on the contrary he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention your own little income he asked does it come out of the business oh no sir it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in auckland it is in new zealand stock paying 4 per cent two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount but i can only touch the interest you interest me extremely said holmes and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year with what you earn into the bargain you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about 60 i could do with much less than that mr holmes but you understand that as long as i live at home i dont wish to be a burden to them and so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them of course that is only just for the time mr windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother and i find that i can do pretty well with what i earn at typewriting it brings me twopence a sheet and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day you have made your position very clear to me said holmes this is my friend dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr hosmer angel a flush stole over miss sutherlands face and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket i met him first at the gasfitters ball she said they used to send father tickets when he was alive and then afterwards they remembered us and sent them to mother mr windibank did not wish us to go he never did wish us to go anywhere he would get quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sundayschool treat but this time i was set on going and i would go for what right had he to prevent he said the folk were not fit for us to know when all fathers friends were to be there and he said that i had nothing fit to wear when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer at last when nothing else would do he went off to france upon the business of the firm but we went mother and i with mr hardy who used to be our foreman and it was there i met mr hosmer angel i suppose said holmes that when mr windibank came back from france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball oh well he was very good about it he laughed i remember and shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying anything to a woman for she would have her way i see then at the gasfitters ball you met as i understand a gentleman called mr hosmer angel yes sir i met him that night and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that we met himthat is to say mr holmes i met him twice for walks but after that father came back again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the house any more no well you know father didnt like anything of the sort he wouldnt have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle but then as i used to say to mother a woman wants her own circle to begin with and i had not got mine yet but how about mr hosmer angel did he make no attempt to see you well father was going off to france again in a week and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone we could write in the meantime and he used to write every day i took the letters in in the morning so there was no need for father to know were you engaged to the gentleman at this time oh yes mr holmes we were engaged after the first walk that we took hosmermr angelwas a cashier in an office in leadenhall streetand what office thats the worst of it mr holmes i dont know where did he live then he slept on the premises and you dont know his address noexcept that it was leadenhall street where did you address your letters then to the leadenhall street post office to be left till called for he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady so i offered to typewrite them like he did his but he wouldnt have that for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us that will just show you how fond he was of me mr holmes and the little things that he would think of it was most suggestive said holmes it has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important can you remember any other little things about mr hosmer angel he was a very shy man mr holmes he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to be conspicuous very retiring and gentlemanly he was even his voice was gentle hed had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech he was always well dressed very neat and plain but his eyes were weak just as mine are and he wore tinted glasses against the glare well and what happened when mr windibank your stepfather returned to france mr hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back he was in dreadful earnest and made me swear with my hands on the testament that whatever happened i would always be true to him mother said he was quite right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was then when they talked of marrying within the week i began to ask about father but they both said never to mind about father but just to tell him afterwards and mother said she would make it all right with him i didnt quite like that mr holmes it seemed funny that i should ask his leave as he was only a few years older than me but i didnt want to do anything on the sly so i wrote to father at bordeaux where the company has its french offices but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding it missed him then yes sir for he had started to england just before it arrived ha that was unfortunate your wedding was arranged then for the friday was it to be in church yes sir but very quietly it was to be at st saviours near kings cross and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st pancras hotel hosmer came for us in a hansom but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a fourwheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the street we got to the church first and when the fourwheeler drove up we waited for him to step out but he never did and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him for he had seen him get in with his own eyes that was last friday mr holmes and i have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated said holmes oh no sir he was too good and kind to leave me so why all the morning he was saying to me that whatever happened i was to be true and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us i was always to remember that i was pledged to him and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later it seemed strange talk for a weddingmorning but what has happened since gives a meaning to it most certainly it does your own opinion is then that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him yes sir i believe that he foresaw some danger or else he would not have talked so and then i think that what he foresaw happened but you have no notion as to what it could have been none one more question how did your mother take the matter she was angry and said that i was never to speak of the matter again and your father did you tell him yes and he seemed to think with me that something had happened and that i should hear of hosmer again as he said what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church and then leaving me now if he had borrowed my money or if he had married me and got my money settled on him there might be some reason but hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine and yet what could have happened and why could he not write oh it drives me halfmad to think of it and i cant sleep a wink at night she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it i shall glance into the case for you said holmes rising and i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result let the weight of the matter rest upon me now and do not let your mind dwell upon it further above all try to let mr hosmer angel vanish from your memory as he has done from your life then you dont think ill see him again i fear not then what has happened to him you will leave that question in my hands i should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare i advertised for him in last saturdays chronicle said she here is the slip and here are four letters from him thank you and your address no 31 lyon place camberwell mr angels address you never had i understand where is your fathers place of business he travels for westhouse marbank the great claret importers of fenchurch street thank you you have made your statement very clearly you will leave the papers here and remember the advice which i have given you let the whole incident be a sealed book and do not allow it to affect your life you are very kind mr holmes but i cannot do that i shall be true to hosmer he shall find me ready when he comes back for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned sherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together his legs stretched out in front of him and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe which was to him as a counsellor and having lit it he leaned back in his chair with the thick blue cloudwreaths spinning up from him and a look of infinite languor in his face quite an interesting study that maiden he observed i found her more interesting than her little problem which by the way is rather a trite one you will find parallel cases if you consult my index in andover in 77 and there was something of the sort at the hague last year old as is the idea however there were one or two details which were new to me but the maiden herself was most instructive you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me i remarked not invisible but unnoticed watson you did not know where to look and so you missed all that was important i can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves the suggestiveness of thumbnails or the great issues that may hang from a bootlace now what did you gather from that womans appearance describe it well she had a slatecoloured broadbrimmed straw hat with a feather of a brickish red her jacket was black with black beads sewn upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments her dress was brown rather darker than coffee colour with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger her boots i didnt observe she had small round hanging gold earrings and a general air of being fairly welltodo in a vulgar comfortable easygoing way sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled pon my word watson you are coming along wonderfully you have really done very well indeed it is true that you have missed everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for colour never trust to general impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details my first glance is always at a womans sleeve in a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser as you observe this woman had plush upon her sleeves which is a most useful material for showing traces the double line a little above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table was beautifully defined the sewingmachine of the hand type leaves a similar mark but only on the left arm and on the side of it farthest from the thumb instead of being right across the broadest part as this was i then glanced at her face and observing the dint of a pincenez at either side of her nose i ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting which seemed to surprise her it surprised me but surely it was obvious i was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other they were really odd ones the one having a slightly decorated toecap and the other a plain one one was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five and the other at the first third and fifth now when you see that a young lady otherwise neatly dressed has come away from home with odd boots halfbuttoned it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry and what else i asked keenly interested as i always was by my friends incisive reasoning i noted in passing that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed you observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink she had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep it must have been this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger all this is amusing though rather elementary but i must go back to business watson would you mind reading me the advertised description of mr hosmer angel i held the little printed slip to the light missing it said on the morning of the fourteenth a gentleman named hosmer angel about five ft seven in in height strongly built sallow complexion black hair a little bald in the centre bushy black sidewhiskers and moustache tinted glasses slight infirmity of speech was dressed when last seen in black frockcoat faced with silk black waistcoat gold albert chain and grey harris tweed trousers with brown gaiters over elasticsided boots known to have been employed in an office in leadenhall street anybody bringing that will do said holmes as to the letters he continued glancing over them they are very commonplace absolutely no clue in them to mr angel save that he quotes balzac once there is one remarkable point however which will no doubt strike you they are typewritten i remarked not only that but the signature is typewritten look at the neat little hosmer angel at the bottom there is a date you see but no superscription except leadenhall street which is rather vague the point about the signature is very suggestivein fact we may call it conclusive of what my dear fellow is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case i cannot say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted no that was not the point however i shall write two letters which should settle the matter one is to a firm in the city the other is to the young ladys stepfather mr windibank asking him whether he could meet us here at six oclock tomorrow evening it is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives and now doctor we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim i had had so many reasons to believe in my friends subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that i felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom once only had i known him to fail in the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler photograph but when i looked back to the weird business of the sign of four and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the study in scarlet i felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel i left him then still puffing at his black clay pipe with the conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time and the whole of next day i was busy at the bedside of the sufferer it was not until close upon six oclock that i found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street half afraid that i might be too late to assist at the dnouement of the little mystery i found sherlock holmes alone however half asleep with his long thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair a formidable array of bottles and testtubes with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him well have you solved it i asked as i entered yes it was the bisulphate of baryta no no the mystery i cried oh that i thought of the salt that i have been working upon there was never any mystery in the matter though as i said yesterday some of the details are of interest the only drawback is that there is no law i fear that can touch the scoundrel who was he then and what was his object in deserting miss sutherland the question was hardly out of my mouth and holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door this is the girls stepfather mr james windibank said holmes he has written to me to say that he would be here at six come in the man who entered was a sturdy middlesized fellow some thirty years of age cleanshaven and sallowskinned with a bland insinuating manner and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes he shot a questioning glance at each of us placed his shiny tophat upon the sideboard and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair goodevening mr james windibank said holmes i think that this typewritten letter is from you in which you made an appointment with me for six oclock yes sir i am afraid that i am a little late but i am not quite my own master you know i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little matter for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public it was quite against my wishes that she came but she is a very excitable impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point of course i did not mind you so much as you are not connected with the official police but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad besides it is a useless expense for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel on the contrary said holmes quietly i have every reason to believe that i will succeed in discovering mr hosmer angel mr windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves i am delighted to hear it he said it is a curious thing remarked holmes that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a mans handwriting unless they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike some letters get more worn than others and some wear only on one side now you remark in this note of yours mr windibank that in every case there is some little slurring over of the e and a slight defect in the tail of the r there are fourteen other characteristics but those are the more obvious we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office and no doubt it is a little worn our visitor answered glancing keenly at holmes with his bright little eyes and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study mr windibank holmes continued i think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention i have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man they are all typewritten in each case not only are the es slurred and the rs tailless but you will observe if you care to use my magnifying lens that the fourteen other characteristics to which i have alluded are there as well mr windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat i cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk mr holmes he said if you can catch the man catch him and let me know when you have done it certainly said holmes stepping over and turning the key in the door i let you know then that i have caught him what where shouted mr windibank turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap oh it wont doreally it wont said holmes suavely there is no possible getting out of it mr windibank it is quite too transparent and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question thats right sit down and let us talk it over our visitor collapsed into a chair with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow itits not actionable he stammered i am very much afraid that it is not but between ourselves windibank it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me now let me just run over the course of events and you will contradict me if i go wrong the man sat huddled up in his chair with his head sunk upon his breast like one who is utterly crushed holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and leaning back with his hands in his pockets began talking rather to himself as it seemed than to us the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money said he and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them it was a considerable sum for people in their position and the loss of it would have made a serious difference it was worth an effort to preserve it the daughter was of a good amiable disposition but affectionate and warmhearted in her ways so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages and her little income she would not be allowed to remain single long now her marriage would mean of course the loss of a hundred a year so what does her stepfather do to prevent it he takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age but soon he found that that would not answer forever she became restive insisted upon her rights and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball what does her clever stepfather do then he conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart with the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper and doubly secure on account of the girls short sight he appears as mr hosmer angel and keeps off other lovers by making love himself it was only a joke at first groaned our visitor we never thought that she would have been so carried away very likely not however that may be the young lady was very decidedly carried away and having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind she was flattered by the gentlemans attentions and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother then mr angel began to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced there were meetings and an engagement which would finally secure the girls affections from turning towards anyone else but the deception could not be kept up forever these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young ladys mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding james windibank wished miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel and so uncertain as to his fate that for ten years to come at any rate she would not listen to another man as far as the church door he brought her and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a fourwheeler and out at the other i think that was the chain of events mr windibank our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes had been talking and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face it may be so or it may not mr holmes said he but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now and not me i have done nothing actionable from the first but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint the law cannot as you say touch you said holmes unlocking and throwing open the door yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more if the young lady has a brother or a friend he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders by jove he continued flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the mans face it is not part of my duties to my client but heres a hunting crop handy and i think i shall just treat myself to he took two swift steps to the whip but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs the heavy hall door banged and from the window we could see mr james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road theres a coldblooded scoundrel said holmes laughing as he threw himself down into his chair once more that fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and ends on a gallows the case has in some respects been not entirely devoid of interest i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning i remarked well of course it was obvious from the first that this mr hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident as far as we could see was the stepfather then the fact that the two men were never together but that the one always appeared when the other was away was suggestive so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice which both hinted at a disguise as did the bushy whiskers my suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature which of course inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it you see all these isolated facts together with many minor ones all pointed in the same direction and how did you verify them having once spotted my man it was easy to get corroboration i knew the firm for which this man worked having taken the printed description i eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguisethe whiskers the glasses the voice and i sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers i had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter and i wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here as i expected his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects the same post brought me a letter from westhouse marbank of fenchurch street to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employ james windibank voil tout and miss sutherland if i tell her she will not believe me you may remember the old persian saying there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace and as much knowledge of the world the boscombe valley mystery we were seated at breakfast one morning my wife and i when the maid brought in a telegram it was from sherlock holmes and ran in this way have you a couple of days to spare have just been wired for from the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy shall be glad if you will come with me air and scenery perfect leave paddington by the 1115 what do you say dear said my wife looking across at me will you go i really dont know what to say i have a fairly long list at present oh anstruther would do your work for you you have been looking a little pale lately i think that the change would do you good and you are always so interested in mr sherlock holmes cases i should be ungrateful if i were not seeing what i gained through one of them i answered but if i am to go i must pack at once for i have only half an hour my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller my wants were few and simple so that in less than the time stated i was in a cab with my valise rattling away to paddington station sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the platform his tall gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travellingcloak and closefitting cloth cap it is really very good of you to come watson said he it makes a considerable difference to me having someone with me on whom i can thoroughly rely local aid is always either worthless or else biassed if you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which holmes had brought with him among these he rummaged and read with intervals of notetaking and of meditation until we were past reading then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack have you heard anything of the case he asked not a word i have not seen a paper for some days the london press has not had very full accounts i have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars it seems from what i gather to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult that sounds a little paradoxical but it is profoundly true singularity is almost invariably a clue the more featureless and commonplace a crime is the more difficult it is to bring it home in this case however they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man it is a murder then well it is conjectured to be so i shall take nothing for granted until i have the opportunity of looking personally into it i will explain the state of things to you as far as i have been able to understand it in a very few words boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross in herefordshire the largest landed proprietor in that part is a mr john turner who made his money in australia and returned some years ago to the old country one of the farms which he held that of hatherley was let to mr charles mccarthy who was also an exaustralian the men had known each other in the colonies so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible turner was apparently the richer man so mccarthy became his tenant but still remained it seems upon terms of perfect equality as they were frequently together mccarthy had one son a lad of eighteen and turner had an only daughter of the same age but neither of them had wives living they appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to have led retired lives though both the mccarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the racemeetings of the neighbourhood mccarthy kept two servantsa man and a girl turner had a considerable household some halfdozen at the least that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families now for the facts on june 3rd that is on monday last mccarthy left his house at hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe pool which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley he had been out with his servingman in the morning at ross and he had told the man that he must hurry as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three from that appointment he never came back alive from hatherley farmhouse to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile and two people saw him as he passed over this ground one was an old woman whose name is not mentioned and the other was william crowder a gamekeeper in the employ of mr turner both these witnesses depose that mr mccarthy was walking alone the gamekeeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing mr mccarthy pass he had seen his son mr james mccarthy going the same way with a gun under his arm to the best of his belief the father was actually in sight at the time and the son was following him he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder the gamekeeper lost sight of them the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge a girl of fourteen patience moran who is the daughter of the lodgekeeper of the boscombe valley estate was in one of the woods picking flowers she states that while she was there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr mccarthy and his son and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel she heard mr mccarthy the elder using very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool and that she was afraid that they were going to fight she had hardly said the words when young mr mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodgekeeper he was much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool the head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon the injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the buttend of his sons gun which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested and a verdict of wilful murder having been returned at the inquest on tuesday he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross who have referred the case to the next assizes those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the policecourt i could hardly imagine a more damning case i remarked if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing answered holmes thoughtfully it may seem to point very straight to one thing but if you shift your own point of view a little you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different it must be confessed however that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit there are several people in the neighbourhood however and among them miss turner the daughter of the neighbouring landowner who believe in his innocence and who have retained lestrade whom you may recollect in connection with the study in scarlet to work out the case in his interest lestrade being rather puzzled has referred the case to me and hence it is that two middleaged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home i am afraid said i that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he answered laughing besides we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr lestrade you know me too well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of understanding to take the first example to hand i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the righthand side and yet i question whether mr lestrade would have noted even so selfevident a thing as that how on earth my dear fellow i know you well i know the military neatness which characterises you you shave every morning and in this season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference therein lies my mtier and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest and which are worth considering what are they it appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after the return to hatherley farm on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroners jury it was a confession i ejaculated no for it was followed by a protestation of innocence coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at least a most suspicious remark on the contrary said holmes it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds however innocent he might be he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him had he appeared surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable selfrestraint and firmness as to his remark about his deserts it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and even according to the little girl whose evidence is so important to raise his hand as if to strike him the selfreproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one i shook my head many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence i remarked so they have and many men have been wrongfully hanged what is the young mans own account of the matter it is i am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive you will find it here and may read it for yourself he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully it ran in this way mr james mccarthy the only son of the deceased was then called and gave evidence as follows i had been away from home for three days at bristol and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday the 3rd my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival and i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb the groom shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and looking out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard though i was not aware in which direction he was going i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side on my way i saw william crowder the gamekeeper as he had stated in his evidence but he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father i had no idea that he was in front of me when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of cooee which was a usual signal between my father and myself i then hurried forward and found him standing by the pool he appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows for my father was a man of a very violent temper seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable i left him and returned towards hatherley farm i had not gone more than 150 yards however when i heard a hideous outcry behind me which caused me to run back again i found my father expiring upon the ground with his head terribly injured i dropped my gun and held him in my arms but he almost instantly expired i knelt beside him for some minutes and then made my way to mr turners lodgekeeper his house being the nearest to ask for assistance i saw no one near my father when i returned and i have no idea how he came by his injuries he was not a popular man being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners but he had as far as i know no active enemies i know nothing further of the matter the coroner did your father make any statement to you before he died witness he mumbled a few words but i could only catch some allusion to a rat the coroner what did you understand by that witness it conveyed no meaning to me i thought that he was delirious the coroner what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel witness i should prefer not to answer the coroner i am afraid that i must press it witness it is really impossible for me to tell you i can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed the coroner that is for the court to decide i need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise witness i must still refuse the coroner i understand that the cry of cooee was a common signal between you and your father witness it was the coroner how was it then that he uttered it before he saw you and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol witness with considerable confusion i do not know a juryman did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured witness nothing definite the coroner what do you mean witness i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into the open that i could think of nothing except of my father yet i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me it seemed to me to be something grey in colour a coat of some sort or a plaid perhaps when i rose from my father i looked round for it but it was gone do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help yes it was gone you cannot say what it was no i had a feeling something was there how far from the body a dozen yards or so and how far from the edge of the wood about the same then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it yes but with my back towards it this concluded the examination of the witness i see said i as i glanced down the column that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy he calls attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and his singular account of his fathers dying words they are all as he remarks very much against the son holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat both you and the coroner have been at some pains said he to single out the very strongest points in the young mans favour dont you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little too little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outr as a dying reference to a rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth no sir i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us and now here is my pocket petrarch and not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of action we lunch at swindon and i see that we shall be there in twenty minutes it was nearly four oclock when we at last after passing through the beautiful stroud valley and over the broad gleaming severn found ourselves at the pretty little countrytown of ross a lean ferretlike man furtive and slylooking was waiting for us upon the platform in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leatherleggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings i had no difficulty in recognising lestrade of scotland yard with him we drove to the hereford arms where a room had already been engaged for us i have ordered a carriage said lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea i knew your energetic nature and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime it was very nice and complimentary of you holmes answered it is entirely a question of barometric pressure lestrade looked startled i do not quite follow he said how is the glass twentynine i see no wind and not a cloud in the sky i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination i do not think that it is probable that i shall use the carriage tonight lestrade laughed indulgently you have no doubt already formed your conclusions from the newspapers he said the case is as plain as a pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes still of course one cant refuse a lady and such a very positive one too she has heard of you and would have your opinion though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not already done why bless my soul here is her carriage at the door he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life her violet eyes shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern oh mr sherlock holmes she cried glancing from one to the other of us and finally with a womans quick intuition fastening upon my companion i am so glad that you have come i have driven down to tell you so i know that james didnt do it i know it and i want you to start upon your work knowing it too never let yourself doubt upon that point we have known each other since we were little children and i know his faults as no one else does but he is too tenderhearted to hurt a fly such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him i hope we may clear him miss turner said sherlock holmes you may rely upon my doing all that i can but you have read the evidence you have formed some conclusion do you not see some loophole some flaw do you not yourself think that he is innocent i think that it is very probable there now she cried throwing back her head and looking defiantly at lestrade you hear he gives me hopes lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions he said but he is right oh i know that he is right james never did it and about his quarrel with his father i am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in it in what way asked holmes it is no time for me to hide anything james and his father had many disagreements about me mr mccarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us james and i have always loved each other as brother and sister but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet andandwell he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet so there were quarrels and this i am sure was one of them and your father asked holmes was he in favour of such a union no he was averse to it also no one but mr mccarthy was in favour of it a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her thank you for this information said he may i see your father if i call tomorrow i am afraid the doctor wont allow it the doctor yes have you not heard poor father has never been strong for years back but this has broken him down completely he has taken to his bed and dr willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered mr mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in victoria ha in victoria that is important yes at the mines quite so at the goldmines where as i understand mr turner made his money yes certainly thank you miss turner you have been of material assistance to me you will tell me if you have any news tomorrow no doubt you will go to the prison to see james oh if you do mr holmes do tell him that i know him to be innocent i will miss turner i must go home now for dad is very ill and he misses me so if i leave him goodbye and god help you in your undertaking she hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street i am ashamed of you holmes said lestrade with dignity after a few minutes silence why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint i am not overtender of heart but i call it cruel i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy said holmes have you an order to see him in prison yes but only for you and me then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out we have still time to take a train to hereford and see him tonight ample then let us do so watson i fear that you will find it very slow but i shall only be away a couple of hours i walked down to the station with them and then wandered through the streets of the little town finally returning to the hotel where i lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellowbacked novel the puny plot of the story was so thin however when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping and i found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact that i at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day supposing that this unhappy young mans story were absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father and the moment when drawn back by his screams he rushed into the glade it was something terrible and deadly what could it be might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts i rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper which contained a verbatim account of the inquest in the surgeons deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon i marked the spot upon my own head clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind that was to some extent in favour of the accused as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father still it did not go for very much for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell still it might be worth while to call holmes attention to it then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat what could that mean it could not be delirium a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious no it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate but what could it indicate i cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation and then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy if that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress presumably his overcoat in his flight and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off what a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was i did not wonder at lestrades opinion and yet i had so much faith in sherlock holmes insight that i could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young mccarthys innocence it was late before sherlock holmes returned he came back alone for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town the glass still keeps very high he remarked as he sat down it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground on the other hand a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that and i did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey i have seen young mccarthy and what did you learn from him nothing could he throw no light none at all i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her but i am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else he is not a very quickwitted youth though comely to look at and i should think sound at heart i cannot admire his taste i remarked if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this miss turner ah thereby hangs a rather painful tale this fellow is madly insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he was only a lad and before he really knew her for she had been away five years at a boardingschool what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office no one knows a word of the matter but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows to be absolutely impossible it was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father at their last interview was goading him on to propose to miss turner on the other hand he had no means of supporting himself and his father who was by all accounts a very hard man would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth it was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in bristol and his father did not know where he was mark that point it is of importance good has come out of evil however for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the bermuda dockyard so that there is really no tie between them i think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all that he has suffered but if he is innocent who has done it ah who i would call your attention very particularly to two points one is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his son for his son was away and he did not know when he would return the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry cooee before he knew that his son had returned those are the crucial points upon which the case depends and now let us talk about george meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor matters until tomorrow there was no rain as holmes had foretold and the morning broke bright and cloudless at nine oclock lestrade called for us with the carriage and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool there is serious news this morning lestrade observed it is said that mr turner of the hall is so ill that his life is despaired of an elderly man i presume said holmes about sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad and he has been in failing health for some time this business has had a very bad effect upon him he was an old friend of mccarthys and i may add a great benefactor to him for i have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free indeed that is interesting said holmes oh yes in a hundred other ways he has helped him everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him really does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have been under such obligations to turner should still talk of marrying his son to turners daughter who is presumably heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow it is the more strange since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea the daughter told us as much do you not deduce something from that we have got to the deductions and the inferences said lestrade winking at me i find it hard enough to tackle facts holmes without flying away after theories and fancies you are right said holmes demurely you do find it very hard to tackle the facts anyhow i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of replied lestrade with some warmth and that is that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine well moonshine is a brighter thing than fog said holmes laughing but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the left yes that is it it was a widespread comfortablelooking building twostoried slateroofed with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys however gave it a stricken look as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it we called at the door when the maid at holmes request showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the sons though not the pair which he had then had having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points holmes desired to be led to the courtyard from which we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have failed to recognise him his face flushed and darkened his brows were drawn into two hard black lines while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter his face was bent downward his shoulders bowed his lips compressed and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long sinewy neck his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears or at the most only provoked a quick impatient snarl in reply swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows and so by way of the woods to the boscombe pool it was damp marshy ground as is all that district and there were marks of many feet both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side sometimes holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow lestrade and i walked behind him the detective indifferent and contemptuous while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end the boscombe pool which is a little reedgirt sheet of water some fifty yards across is situated at the boundary between the hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr turner above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowners dwelling on the hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found and indeed so moist was the ground that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man to holmes as i could see by his eager face and peering eyes very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass he ran round like a dog who is picking up a scent and then turned upon my companion what did you go into the pool for he asked i fished about with a rake i thought there might be some weapon or other trace but how on earth oh tut tut i have no time that left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place a mole could trace it and there it vanishes among the reeds oh how simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it here is where the party with the lodgekeeper came and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body but here are three separate tracks of the same feet he drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view talking all the time rather to himself than to us these are young mccarthys feet twice he was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible that bears out his story he ran when he saw his father on the ground then here are the fathers feet as he paced up and down what is this then it is the buttend of the gun as the son stood listening and this ha ha what have we here tiptoes tiptoes square too quite unusual boots they come they go they come againof course that was for the cloak now where did they come from he ran up and down sometimes losing sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction for a long time he remained there turning over the leaves and dried sticks gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach a jagged stone was lying among the moss and this also he carefully examined and retained then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad where all traces were lost it has been a case of considerable interest he remarked returning to his natural manner i fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge i think that i will go in and have a word with moran and perhaps write a little note having done that we may drive back to our luncheon you may walk to the cab and i shall be with you presently it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into ross holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood this may interest you lestrade he remarked holding it out the murder was done with it i see no marks there are none how do you know then the grass was growing under it it had only lain there a few days there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken it corresponds with the injuries there is no sign of any other weapon and the murderer is a tall man lefthanded limps with the right leg wears thicksoled shootingboots and a grey cloak smokes indian cigars uses a cigarholder and carries a blunt penknife in his pocket there are several other indications but these may be enough to aid us in our search lestrade laughed i am afraid that i am still a sceptic he said theories are all very well but we have to deal with a hardheaded british jury nous verrons answered holmes calmly you work your own method and i shall work mine i shall be busy this afternoon and shall probably return to london by the evening train and leave your case unfinished no finished but the mystery it is solved who was the criminal then the gentleman i describe but who is he surely it would not be difficult to find out this is not such a populous neighbourhood lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am a practical man he said and i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a lefthanded gentleman with a game leg i should become the laughingstock of scotland yard all right said holmes quietly i have given you the chance here are your lodgings goodbye i shall drop you a line before i leave having left lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel where we found lunch upon the table holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face as one who finds himself in a perplexing position look here watson he said when the cloth was cleared just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little i dont know quite what to do and i should value your advice light a cigar and let me expound pray do so well now in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthys narrative which struck us both instantly although they impressed me in his favour and you against him one was the fact that his father should according to his account cry cooee before seeing him the other was his singular dying reference to a rat he mumbled several words you understand but that was all that caught the sons ear now from this double point our research must commence and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true what of this cooee then well obviously it could not have been meant for the son the son as far as he knew was in bristol it was mere chance that he was within earshot the cooee was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with but cooee is a distinctly australian cry and one which is used between australians there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia what of the rat then sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table this is a map of the colony of victoria he said i wired to bristol for it last night he put his hand over part of the map what do you read arat i read and now he raised his hand ballarat quite so that was the word the man uttered and of which his son only caught the last two syllables he was trying to utter the name of his murderer so and so of ballarat it is wonderful i exclaimed it is obvious and now you see i had narrowed the field down considerably the possession of a grey garment was a third point which granting the sons statement to be correct was a certainty we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak certainly and one who was at home in the district for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could hardly wander quite so then comes our expedition of today by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade as to the personality of the criminal but how did you gain them you know my method it is founded upon the observation of trifles his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride his boots too might be told from their traces yes they were peculiar boots but his lameness the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left he put less weight upon it why because he limpedhe was lame but his lefthandedness you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest the blow was struck from immediately behind and yet was upon the left side now how can that be unless it were by a lefthanded man he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son he had even smoked there i found the ash of a cigar which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian cigar i have as you know devoted some attention to this and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco having found the ash i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it it was an indian cigar of the variety which are rolled in rotterdam and the cigarholder i could see that the end had not been in his mouth therefore he used a holder the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the cut was not a clean one so i deduced a blunt penknife holmes i said you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him i see the direction in which all this points the culprit is mr john turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of our sittingroom and ushering in a visitor the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure his slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude and yet his hard deeplined craggy features and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character his tangled beard grizzled hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was of an ashen white while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue it was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease pray sit down on the sofa said holmes gently you had my note yes the lodgekeeper brought it up you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal i thought people would talk if i went to the hall and why did you wish to see me he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question was already answered yes said holmes answering the look rather than the words it is so i know all about mccarthy the old man sank his face in his hands god help me he cried but i would not have let the young man come to harm i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes i am glad to hear you say so said holmes gravely i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl it would break her heartit will break her heart when she hears that i am arrested it may not come to that said holmes what i am no official agent i understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here and i am acting in her interests young mccarthy must be got off however i am a dying man said old turner i have had diabetes for years my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him just tell us the truth he said i shall jot down the facts you will sign it and watson here can witness it then i could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young mccarthy i promise you that i shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed its as well said the old man its a question whether i shall live to the assizes so it matters little to me but i should wish to spare alice the shock and now i will make the thing clear to you it has been a long time in the acting but will not take me long to tell you didnt know this dead man mccarthy he was a devil incarnate i tell you that god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he his grip has been upon me these twenty years and he has blasted my life ill tell you first how i came to be in his power it was in the early 60s at the diggings i was a young chap then hotblooded and reckless ready to turn my hand at anything i got among bad companions took to drink had no luck with my claim took to the bush and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber there were six of us and we had a wild free life of it sticking up a station from time to time or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings black jack of ballarat was the name i went under and our party is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne and we lay in wait for it and attacked it there were six troopers and six of us so it was a close thing but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley three of our boys were killed however before we got the swag i put my pistol to the head of the wagondriver who was this very man mccarthy i wish to the lord that i had shot him then but i spared him though i saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face as though to remember every feature we got away with the gold became wealthy men and made our way over to england without being suspected there i parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life i bought this estate which chanced to be in the market and i set myself to do a little good with my money to make up for the way in which i had earned it i married too and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done in a word i turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past all was going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me i had gone up to town about an investment and i met him in regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot here we are jack says he touching me on the arm well be as good as a family to you theres two of us me and my son and you can have the keeping of us if you dontits a fine lawabiding country is england and theres always a policeman within hail well down they came to the west country there was no shaking them off and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since there was no rest for me no peace no forgetfulness turn where i would there was his cunning grinning face at my elbow it grew worse as alice grew up for he soon saw i was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police whatever he wanted he must have and whatever it was i gave him without question land money houses until at last he asked a thing which i could not give he asked for alice his son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as i was known to be in weak health it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property but there i was firm i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine not that i had any dislike to the lad but his blood was in him and that was enough i stood firm mccarthy threatened i braved him to do his worst we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over when i went down there i found him talking with his son so i smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this could i not snap the bond i was already a dying and a desperate man though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb i knew that my own fate was sealed but my memory and my girl both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue i did it mr holmes i would do it again deeply as i have sinned i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it but that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than i could suffer i struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast his cry brought back his son but i had gained the cover of the wood though i was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in my flight that is the true story gentlemen of all that occurred well it is not for me to judge you said holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out i pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation i pray not sir and what do you intend to do in view of your health nothing you are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes i will keep your confession and if mccarthy is condemned i shall be forced to use it if not it shall never be seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or dead shall be safe with us farewell then said the old man solemnly your own deathbeds when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine tottering and shaking in all his giant frame he stumbled slowly from the room god help us said holmes after a long silence why does fate play such tricks with poor helpless worms i never hear of such a case as this that i do not think of baxters words and say there but for the grace of god goes sherlock holmes james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and submitted to the defending counsel old turner lived for seven months after our interview but he is now dead and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past the five orange pips when i glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes cases between the years 82 and 90 i am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave some however have already gained publicity through the papers and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate some too have baffled his analytical skill and would be as narratives beginnings without an ending while others have been but partially cleared up and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him there is however one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that i am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been and probably never will be entirely cleared up the year 87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest of which i retain the records among my headings under this one twelve months i find an account of the adventure of the paradol chamber of the amateur mendicant society who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse of the facts connected with the loss of the british barque sophy anderson of the singular adventures of the grice patersons in the island of uffa and finally of the camberwell poisoning case in the latter as may be remembered sherlock holmes was able by winding up the dead mans watch to prove that it had been wound up two hours before and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that timea deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case all these i may sketch out at some future date but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which i have now taken up my pen to describe it was in the latter days of september and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence all day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows so that even here in the heart of great handmade london we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation like untamed beasts in a cage as evening drew in the storm grew higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace crossindexing his records of crime while i at the other was deep in one of clark russells fine seastories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves my wife was on a visit to her mothers and for a few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker street why said i glancing up at my companion that was surely the bell who could come tonight some friend of yours perhaps except yourself i have none he answered i do not encourage visitors a client then if so it is a serious case nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour but i take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landladys sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door he stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit come in said he the man who entered was young some twoandtwenty at the outside wellgroomed and trimly clad with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing the streaming umbrella which he held in his hand and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come he looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp and i could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety i owe you an apology he said raising his golden pincenez to his eyes i trust that i am not intruding i fear that i have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber give me your coat and umbrella said holmes they may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently you have come up from the southwest i see yes from horsham that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive i have come for advice that is easily got and help that is not always so easy i have heard of you mr holmes i heard from major prendergast how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal ah of course he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards he said that you could solve anything he said too much that you are never beaten i have been beaten four timesthree times by men and once by a woman but what is that compared with the number of your successes it is true that i have been generally successful then you may be so with me i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case it is no ordinary one none of those which come to me are i am the last court of appeal and yet i question sir whether in all your experience you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family you fill me with interest said holmes pray give us the essential facts from the commencement and i can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze my name said he is john openshaw but my own affairs have as far as i can understand little to do with this awful business it is a hereditary matter so in order to give you an idea of the facts i must go back to the commencement of the affair you must know that my grandfather had two sonsmy uncle elias and my father joseph my father had a small factory at coventry which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling he was a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man and became a planter in florida where he was reported to have done very well at the time of the war he fought in jacksons army and afterwards under hood where he rose to be a colonel when lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation where he remained for three or four years about 1869 or 1870 he came back to europe and took a small estate in sussex near horsham he had made a very considerable fortune in the states and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes and his dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to them he was a singular man fierce and quicktempered very foulmouthed when he was angry and of a most retiring disposition during all the years that he lived at horsham i doubt if ever he set foot in the town he had a garden and two or three fields round his house and there he would take his exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room he drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily but he would see no society and did not want any friends not even his own brother he didnt mind me in fact he took a fancy to me for at the time when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelve or so this would be in the year 1878 after he had been eight or nine years in england he begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way when he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite master of the house i kept all the keys and could go where i liked and do what i liked so long as i did not disturb him in his privacy there was one singular exception however for he had a single room a lumberroom up among the attics which was invariably locked and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter with a boys curiosity i have peeped through the keyhole but i was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room one dayit was in march 1883a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonels plate it was not a common thing for him to receive letters for his bills were all paid in ready money and he had no friends of any sort from india said he as he took it up pondicherry postmark what can this be opening it hurriedly out there jumped five little dried orange pips which pattered down upon his plate i began to laugh at this but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face his lip had fallen his eyes were protruding his skin the colour of putty and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand k k k he shrieked and then my god my god my sins have overtaken me what is it uncle i cried death said he and rising from the table he retired to his room leaving me palpitating with horror i took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap just above the gum the letter k three times repeated there was nothing else save the five dried pips what could be the reason of his overpowering terror i left the breakfasttable and as i ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key which must have belonged to the attic in one hand and a small brass box like a cashbox in the other they may do what they like but ill checkmate them still said he with an oath tell mary that i shall want a fire in my room today and send down to fordham the horsham lawyer i did as he ordered and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to step up to the room the fire was burning brightly and in the grate there was a mass of black fluffy ashes as of burned paper while the brass box stood open and empty beside it as i glanced at the box i noticed with a start that upon the lid was printed the treble k which i had read in the morning upon the envelope i wish you john said my uncle to witness my will i leave my estate with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my brother your father whence it will no doubt descend to you if you can enjoy it in peace well and good if you find you cannot take my advice my boy and leave it to your deadliest enemy i am sorry to give you such a twoedged thing but i cant say what turn things are going to take kindly sign the paper where mr fordham shows you i signed the paper as directed and the lawyer took it away with him the singular incident made as you may think the deepest impression upon me and i pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it yet i could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives i could see a change in my uncle however he drank more than ever and he was less inclined for any sort of society most of his time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man and that he was not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by man or devil when these hot fits were over however he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul at such times i have seen his face even on a cold day glisten with moisture as though it were new raised from a basin well to come to an end of the matter mr holmes and not to abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back we found him when we went to search for him face downward in a little greenscummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden there was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity brought in a verdict of suicide but i who knew how he winced from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it the matter passed however and my father entered into possession of the estate and of some 14000 which lay to his credit at the bank one moment holmes interposed your statement is i foresee one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listened let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and the date of his supposed suicide the letter arrived on march 10 1883 his death was seven weeks later upon the night of may 2nd thank you pray proceed when my father took over the horsham property he at my request made a careful examination of the attic which had been always locked up we found the brass box there although its contents had been destroyed on the inside of the cover was a paper label with the initials of k k k repeated upon it and letters memoranda receipts and a register written beneath these we presume indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw for the rest there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and notebooks bearing upon my uncles life in america some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern states and were mostly concerned with politics for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpetbag politicians who had been sent down from the north well it was the beginning of 84 when my father came to live at horsham and all went as well as possible with us until the january of 85 on the fourth day after the new year i heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfasttable there he was sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one he had always laughed at what he called my cockandbull story about the colonel but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself why what on earth does this mean john he stammered my heart had turned to lead it is k k k said i he looked inside the envelope so it is he cried here are the very letters but what is this written above them put the papers on the sundial i read peeping over his shoulder what papers what sundial he asked the sundial in the garden there is no other said i but the papers must be those that are destroyed pooh said he gripping hard at his courage we are in a civilised land here and we cant have tomfoolery of this kind where does the thing come from from dundee i answered glancing at the postmark some preposterous practical joke said he what have i to do with sundials and papers i shall take no notice of such nonsense i should certainly speak to the police i said and be laughed at for my pains nothing of the sort then let me do so no i forbid you i wont have a fuss made about such nonsense it was in vain to argue with him for he was a very obstinate man i went about however with a heart which was full of forebodings on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his major freebody who is in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill i was glad that he should go for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home in that however i was in error upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram from the major imploring me to come at once my father had fallen over one of the deep chalkpits which abound in the neighbourhood and was lying senseless with a shattered skull i hurried to him but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness he had as it appears been returning from fareham in the twilight and as the country was unknown to him and the chalkpit unfenced the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of death from accidental causes carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death i was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder there were no signs of violence no footmarks no robbery no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease and that i was wellnigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him in this sinister way i came into my inheritance you will ask me why i did not dispose of it i answer because i was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncles life and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another it was in january 85 that my poor father met his end and two years and eight months have elapsed since then during that time i have lived happily at horsham and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family and that it had ended with the last generation i had begun to take comfort too soon however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips this is the envelope he continued the postmark is londoneastern division within are the very words which were upon my fathers last message k k k and then put the papers on the sundial what have you done asked holmes nothing nothing to tell the truthhe sank his face into his thin white handsi have felt helpless i have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it i seem to be in the grasp of some resistless inexorable evil which no foresight and no precautions can guard against tut tut cried sherlock holmes you must act man or you are lost nothing but energy can save you this is no time for despair i have seen the police ah but they listened to my story with a smile i am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with the warnings holmes shook his clenched hands in the air incredible imbecility he cried they have however allowed me a policeman who may remain in the house with me has he come with you tonight no his orders were to stay in the house again holmes raved in the air why did you come to me he cried and above all why did you not come at once i did not know it was only today that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you it is really two days since you had the letter we should have acted before this you have no further evidence i suppose than that which you have placed before usno suggestive detail which might help us there is one thing said john openshaw he rummaged in his coat pocket and drawing out a piece of discoloured bluetinted paper he laid it out upon the table i have some remembrance said he that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room and i am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from among the others and in that way has escaped destruction beyond the mention of pips i do not see that it helps us much i think myself that it is a page from some private diary the writing is undoubtedly my uncles holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book it was headed march 1869 and beneath were the following enigmatical notices 4th hudson came same old platform 7th set the pips on mccauley paramore and john swain of st augustine 9th mccauley cleared 10th john swain cleared 12th visited paramore all well thank you said holmes folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor and now you must on no account lose another instant we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me you must get home instantly and act what shall i do there is but one thing to do it must be done at once you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them having done this you must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed do you understand entirely do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present i think that we may gain that by means of the law but we have our web to weave while theirs is already woven the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties i thank you said the young man rising and pulling on his overcoat you have given me fresh life and hope i shall certainly do as you advise do not lose an instant and above all take care of yourself in the meanwhile for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger how do you go back by train from waterloo it is not yet nine the streets will be crowded so i trust that you may be in safety and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely i am armed that is well tomorrow i shall set to work upon your case i shall see you at horsham then no your secret lies in london it is there that i shall seek it then i shall call upon you in a day or in two days with news as to the box and the papers i shall take your advice in every particular he shook hands with us and took his leave outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows this strange wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elementsblown in upon us like a sheet of seaweed in a galeand now to have been reabsorbed by them once more sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire then he lit his pipe and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smokerings as they chased each other up to the ceiling i think watson he remarked at last that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this save perhaps the sign of four well yes save perhaps that and yet this john openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos but have you i asked formed any definite conception as to what these perils are there can be no question as to their nature he answered then what are they who is this k k k and why does he pursue this unhappy family sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair with his fingertips together the ideal reasoner he remarked would when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones both before and after we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses to carry the art however to its highest pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all knowledge which even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias is a somewhat rare accomplishment it is not so impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this i have endeavoured in my case to do if i remember rightly you on one occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits in a very precise fashion yes i answered laughing it was a singular document philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at zero i remember botany variable geology profound as regards the mudstains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime records unique violinplayer boxer swordsman lawyer and selfpoisoner by cocaine and tobacco those i think were the main points of my analysis holmes grinned at the last item well he said i say now as i said then that a man should keep his little brainattic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumberroom of his library where he can get it if he wants it now for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us tonight we need certainly to muster all our resources kindly hand me down the letter k of the american encyclopaedia which stands upon the shelf beside you thank you now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it in the first place we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from america as to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors did you remark the postmarks of those letters the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the third from london from east london what do you deduce from that they are all seaports that the writer was on board of a ship excellent we have already a clue there can be no doubt that the probabilitythe strong probabilityis that the writer was on board of a ship and now let us consider another point in the case of pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment in dundee it was only some three or four days does that suggest anything a greater distance to travel but the letter had also a greater distance to come then i do not see the point there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailingship it looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed i think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mailboat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer it is possible more than that it is probable and now you see the deadly urgency of this new case and why i urged young openshaw to caution the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance but this one comes from london and therefore we cannot count upon delay good god i cried what can it mean this relentless persecution the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailingship i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroners jury there must have been several in it and they must have been men of resource and determination their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may in this way you see k k k ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society but of what society have you never said sherlock holmes bending forward and sinking his voicehave you never heard of the ku klux klan i never have holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee here it is said he presently ku klux klan a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle this terrible secret society was formed by some exconfederate soldiers in the southern states after the civil war and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country notably in tennessee louisiana the carolinas georgia and florida its power was used for political purposes principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shapea sprig of oakleaves in some parts melon seeds or orange pips in others on receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways or might fly from the country if he braved the matter out death would unfailingly come upon him and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner so perfect was the organisation of the society and so systematic its methods that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators for some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the united states government and of the better classes of the community in the south eventually in the year 1869 the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date you will observe said holmes laying down the volume that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers it may well have been cause and effect it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track you can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered then the page we have seen is such as we might expect it ran if i remember right sent the pips to a b and cthat is sent the societys warning to them then there are successive entries that a and b cleared or left the country and finally that c was visited with i fear a sinister result for c well i think doctor that we may let some light into this dark place and i believe that the only chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have told him there is nothing more to be said or to be done tonight so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men it had cleared in the morning and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came down you will excuse me for not waiting for you said he i have i foresee a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young openshaws what steps will you take i asked it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries i may have to go down to horsham after all you will not go there first no i shall commence with the city just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee as i waited i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it it rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart holmes i cried you are too late ah said he laying down his cup i feared as much how was it done he spoke calmly but i could see that he was deeply moved my eye caught the name of openshaw and the heading tragedy near waterloo bridge here is the account between nine and ten last night policeconstable cook of the h division on duty near waterloo bridge heard a cry for help and a splash in the water the night however was extremely dark and stormy so that in spite of the help of several passersby it was quite impossible to effect a rescue the alarm however was given and by the aid of the waterpolice the body was eventually recovered it proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket was john openshaw and whose residence is near horsham it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landingplaces for river steamboats the body exhibited no traces of violence and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landingstages we sat in silence for some minutes holmes more depressed and shaken than i had ever seen him that hurts my pride watson he said at last it is a petty feeling no doubt but it hurts my pride it becomes a personal matter with me now and if god sends me health i shall set my hand upon this gang that he should come to me for help and that i should send him away to his death he sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands they must be cunning devils he exclaimed at last how could they have decoyed him down there the embankment is not on the direct line to the station the bridge no doubt was too crowded even on such a night for their purpose well watson we shall see who will win in the long run i am going out now to the police no i shall be my own police when i have spun the web they may take the flies but not before all day i was engaged in my professional work and it was late in the evening before i returned to baker street sherlock holmes had not come back yet it was nearly ten oclock before he entered looking pale and worn he walked up to the sideboard and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously washing it down with a long draught of water you are hungry i remarked starving it had escaped my memory i have had nothing since breakfast nothing not a bite i had no time to think of it and how have you succeeded well you have a clue i have them in the hollow of my hand young openshaw shall not long remain unavenged why watson let us put their own devilish trademark upon them it is well thought of what do you mean he took an orange from the cupboard and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope on the inside of the flap he wrote s h for j o then he sealed it and addressed it to captain james calhoun barque lone star savannah georgia that will await him when he enters port said he chuckling it may give him a sleepless night he will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him and who is this captain calhoun the leader of the gang i shall have the others but he first how did you trace it then he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket all covered with dates and names i have spent the whole day said he over lloyds registers and files of the old papers following the future career of every vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in 83 there were thirtysix ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months of these one the lone star instantly attracted my attention since although it was reported as having cleared from london the name is that which is given to one of the states of the union texas i think i was not and am not sure which but i knew that the ship must have an american origin what then i searched the dundee records and when i found that the barque lone star was there in january 85 my suspicion became a certainty i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of london yes the lone star had arrived here last week i went down to the albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning homeward bound to savannah i wired to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago and as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight what will you do then oh i have my hand upon him he and the two mates are as i learn the only nativeborn americans in the ship the others are finns and germans i know also that they were all three away from the ship last night i had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo by the time that their sailingship reaches savannah the mailboat will have carried this letter and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder there is ever a flaw however in the best laid of human plans and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another as cunning and as resolute as themselves was upon their track very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year we waited long for news of the lone star of savannah but none ever reached us we did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a shattered sternpost of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave with the letters l s carved upon it and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the lone star the man with the twisted lip isa whitney brother of the late elias whitney dd principal of the theological college of st georges was much addicted to opium the habit grew upon him as i understand from some foolish freak when he was at college for having read de quinceys description of his dreams and sensations he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects he found as so many more have done that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives i can see him now with yellow pasty face drooping lids and pinpoint pupils all huddled in a chair the wreck and ruin of a noble man one nightit was in june 89there came a ring to my bell about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock i sat up in my chair and my wife laid her needlework down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment a patient said she youll have to go out i groaned for i was newly come back from a weary day we heard the door open a few hurried words and then quick steps upon the linoleum our own door flew open and a lady clad in some darkcoloured stuff with a black veil entered the room you will excuse my calling so late she began and then suddenly losing her selfcontrol she ran forward threw her arms about my wifes neck and sobbed upon her shoulder oh im in such trouble she cried i do so want a little help why said my wife pulling up her veil it is kate whitney how you startled me kate i had not an idea who you were when you came in i didnt know what to do so i came straight to you that was always the way folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse it was very sweet of you to come now you must have some wine and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it or should you rather that i sent james off to bed oh no no i want the doctors advice and help too its about isa he has not been home for two days i am so frightened about him it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husbands trouble to me as a doctor to my wife as an old friend and school companion we soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find did she know where her husband was was it possible that we could bring him back to her it seems that it was she had the surest information that of late he had when the fit was on him made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the city hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day and he had come back twitching and shattered in the evening but now the spell had been upon him eightandforty hours and he lay there doubtless among the dregs of the docks breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects there he was to be found she was sure of it at the bar of gold in upper swandam lane but what was she to do how could she a young and timid woman make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him there was the case and of course there was but one way out of it might i not escort her to this place and then as a second thought why should she come at all i was isa whitneys medical adviser and as such i had influence over him i could manage it better if i were alone i promised her on my word that i would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me and so in ten minutes i had left my armchair and cheery sittingroom behind me and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand as it seemed to me at the time though the future only could show how strange it was to be but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of london bridge between a slopshop and a ginshop approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave i found the den of which i was in search ordering my cab to wait i passed down the steps worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet and by the light of a flickering oillamp above the door i found the latch and made my way into a long low room thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke and terraced with wooden berths like the forecastle of an emigrant ship through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses bowed shoulders bent knees heads thrown back and chins pointing upward with here and there a dark lacklustre eye turned upon the newcomer out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light now bright now faint as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes the most lay silent but some muttered to themselves and others talked together in a strange low monotonous voice their conversation coming in gushes and then suddenly tailing off into silence each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour at the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal beside which on a threelegged wooden stool there sat a tall thin old man with his jaw resting upon his two fists and his elbows upon his knees staring into the fire as i entered a sallow malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug beckoning me to an empty berth thank you i have not come to stay said i there is a friend of mine here mr isa whitney and i wish to speak with him there was a movement and an exclamation from my right and peering through the gloom i saw whitney pale haggard and unkempt staring out at me my god its watson said he he was in a pitiable state of reaction with every nerve in a twitter i say watson what oclock is it nearly eleven of what day of friday june 19th good heavens i thought it was wednesday it is wednesday what dyou want to frighten a chap for he sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key i tell you that it is friday man your wife has been waiting this two days for you you should be ashamed of yourself so i am but youve got mixed watson for i have only been here a few hours three pipes four pipesi forget how many but ill go home with you i wouldnt frighten katepoor little kate give me your hand have you a cab yes i have one waiting then i shall go in it but i must owe something find what i owe watson i am all off colour i can do nothing for myself i walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers holding my breath to keep out the vile stupefying fumes of the drug and looking about for the manager as i passed the tall man who sat by the brazier i felt a sudden pluck at my skirt and a low voice whispered walk past me and then look back at me the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear i glanced down they could only have come from the old man at my side and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever very thin very wrinkled bent with age an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers i took two steps forward and looked back it took all my selfcontrol to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment he had turned his back so that none could see him but i his form had filled out his wrinkles were gone the dull eyes had regained their fire and there sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise was none other than sherlock holmes he made a slight motion to me to approach him and instantly as he turned his face half round to the company once more subsided into a doddering looselipped senility holmes i whispered what on earth are you doing in this den as low as you can he answered i have excellent ears if you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours i should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you i have a cab outside then pray send him home in it you may safely trust him for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief i should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me if you will wait outside i shall be with you in five minutes it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes requests for they were always so exceedingly definite and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery i felt however that when whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished and for the rest i could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence in a few minutes i had written my note paid whitneys bill led him out to the cab and seen him driven through the darkness in a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den and i was walking down the street with sherlock holmes for two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot then glancing quickly round he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter i suppose watson said he that you imagine that i have added opiumsmoking to cocaine injections and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views i was certainly surprised to find you there but not more so than i to find you i came to find a friend and i to find an enemy an enemy yes one of my natural enemies or shall i say my natural prey briefly watson i am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry and i have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots as i have done before now had i been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hours purchase for i have used it before now for my own purposes and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me there is a trapdoor at the back of that building near the corner of pauls wharf which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights what you do not mean bodies ay bodies watson we should be rich men if we had 1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den it is the vilest murdertrap on the whole riverside and i fear that neville st clair has entered it never to leave it more but our trap should be here he put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrillya signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses hoofs now watson said holmes as a tall dogcart dashed up through the gloom throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns youll come with me wont you if i can be of use oh a trusty comrade is always of use and a chronicler still more so my room at the cedars is a doublebedded one the cedars yes that is mr st clairs house i am staying there while i conduct the inquiry where is it then near lee in kent we have a sevenmile drive before us but i am all in the dark of course you are youll know all about it presently jump up here all right john we shall not need you heres half a crown look out for me tomorrow about eleven give her her head so long then he flicked the horse with his whip and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets which widened gradually until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar its silence broken only by the heavy regular footfall of the policeman or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds holmes drove in silence with his head sunk upon his breast and the air of a man who is lost in thought while i sat beside him curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts we had driven several miles and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas when he shook himself shrugged his shoulders and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best you have a grand gift of silence watson said he it makes you quite invaluable as a companion pon my word it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to for my own thoughts are not overpleasant i was wondering what i should say to this dear little woman tonight when she meets me at the door you forget that i know nothing about it i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to lee it seems absurdly simple and yet somehow i can get nothing to go upon theres plenty of thread no doubt but i cant get the end of it into my hand now ill state the case clearly and concisely to you watson and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me proceed then some years agoto be definite in may 1884there came to lee a gentleman neville st clair by name who appeared to have plenty of money he took a large villa laid out the grounds very nicely and lived generally in good style by degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer by whom he now has two children he had no occupation but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning returning by the 514 from cannon street every night mr st clair is now thirtyseven years of age is a man of temperate habits a good husband a very affectionate father and a man who is popular with all who know him i may add that his whole debts at the present moment as far as we have been able to ascertain amount to 88 10s while he has 220 standing to his credit in the capital and counties bank there is no reason therefore to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind last monday mr neville st clair went into town rather earlier than usual remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks now by the merest chance his wife received a telegram upon this same monday very shortly after his departure to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the aberdeen shipping company now if you are well up in your london you will know that the office of the company is in fresno street which branches out of upper swandam lane where you found me tonight mrs st clair had her lunch started for the city did some shopping proceeded to the companys office got her packet and found herself at exactly 435 walking through swandam lane on her way back to the station have you followed me so far it is very clear if you remember monday was an exceedingly hot day and mrs st clair walked slowly glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself while she was walking in this way down swandam lane she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and as it seemed to her beckoning to her from a secondfloor window the window was open and she distinctly saw his face which she describes as being terribly agitated he waved his hands frantically to her and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat such as he had started to town in he had on neither collar nor necktie convinced that something was amiss with him she rushed down the stepsfor the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me tonightand running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor at the foot of the stairs however she met this lascar scoundrel of whom i have spoken who thrust her back and aided by a dane who acts as assistant there pushed her out into the street filled with the most maddening doubts and fears she rushed down the lane and by rare goodfortune met in fresno street a number of constables with an inspector all on their way to their beat the inspector and two men accompanied her back and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor they made their way to the room in which mr st clair had last been seen there was no sign of him there in fact in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect who it seems made his home there both he and the lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon so determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered and had almost come to believe that mrs st clair had been deluded when with a cry she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it out there fell a cascade of childrens bricks it was the toy which he had promised to bring home this discovery and the evident confusion which the cripple showed made the inspector realise that the matter was serious the rooms were carefully examined and results all pointed to an abominable crime the front room was plainly furnished as a sittingroom and led into a small bedroom which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water the bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below on examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of mr neville st clair with the exception of his coat his boots his socks his hat and his watchall were there there were no signs of violence upon any of these garments and there were no other traces of mr neville st clair out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents but as by mrs st clairs story he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husbands appearance at the window he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime his defence was one of absolute ignorance and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone his lodger and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentlemans clothes so much for the lascar manager now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st clair his name is hugh boone and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city he is a professional beggar though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas some little distance down threadneedle street upon the lefthand side there is as you may have remarked a small angle in the wall here it is that this creature takes his daily seat crosslegged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him i have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of making his professional acquaintance and i have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time his appearance you see is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him a shock of orange hair a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar which by its contraction has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip a bulldog chin and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so too does his wit for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passersby this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest but a cripple said i what could he have done singlehanded against a man in the prime of life he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and wellnurtured man surely your medical experience would tell you watson that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others pray continue your narrative mrs st clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window and she was escorted home in a cab by the police as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations inspector barton who had charge of the case made a very careful examination of the premises but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter one mistake had been made in not arresting boone instantly as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the lascar but this fault was soon remedied and he was seized and searched without anything being found which could incriminate him there were it is true some bloodstains upon his right shirtsleeve but he pointed to his ringfinger which had been cut near the nail and explained that the bleeding came from there adding that he had been to the window not long before and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source he denied strenuously having ever seen mr neville st clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police as to mrs st clairs assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming he was removed loudly protesting to the policestation while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue and it did though they hardly found upon the mudbank what they had feared to find it was neville st clairs coat and not neville st clair which lay uncovered as the tide receded and what do you think they found in the pockets i cannot imagine no i dont think you would guess every pocket stuffed with pennies and halfpennies421 pennies and 270 halfpennies it was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide but a human body is a different matter there is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house it seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the room would the body be dressed in a coat alone no sir but the facts might be met speciously enough suppose that this man boone had thrust neville st clair through the window there is no human eye which could have seen the deed what would he do then it would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the telltale garments he would seize the coat then and be in the act of throwing it out when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink he has little time for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up and perhaps he has already heard from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street there is not an instant to be lost he rushes to some secret hoard where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coats sinking he throws it out and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared it certainly sounds feasible well we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better boone as i have told you was arrested and taken to the station but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him he had for years been known as a professional beggar but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one there the matter stands at present and the questions which have to be solvedwhat neville st clair was doing in the opium den what happened to him when there where is he now and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearanceare all as far from a solution as ever i confess that i cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of events we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us just as he finished however we drove through two scattered villages where a few lights still glimmered in the windows we are on the outskirts of lee said my companion we have touched on three english counties in our short drive starting in middlesex passing over an angle of surrey and ending in kent see that light among the trees that is the cedars and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already i have little doubt caught the clink of our horses feet but why are you not conducting the case from baker street i asked because there are many inquiries which must be made out here mrs st clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague i hate to meet her watson when i have no news of her husband here we are whoa there whoa we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds a stableboy had run out to the horses head and springing down i followed holmes up the small winding graveldrive which led to the house as we approached the door flew open and a little blonde woman stood in the opening clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists she stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light one hand upon the door one halfraised in her eagerness her body slightly bent her head and face protruded with eager eyes and parted lips a standing question well she cried well and then seeing that there were two of us she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders no good news none no bad no thank god for that but come in you must be weary for you have had a long day this is my friend dr watson he has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation i am delighted to see you said she pressing my hand warmly you will i am sure forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us my dear madam said i i am an old campaigner and if i were not i can very well see that no apology is needed if i can be of any assistance either to you or to my friend here i shall be indeed happy now mr sherlock holmes said the lady as we entered a welllit diningroom upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out i should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions to which i beg that you will give a plain answer certainly madam do not trouble about my feelings i am not hysterical nor given to fainting i simply wish to hear your real real opinion upon what point in your heart of hearts do you think that neville is alive sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question frankly now she repeated standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basketchair frankly then madam i do not you think that he is dead i do murdered i dont say that perhaps and on what day did he meet his death on monday then perhaps mr holmes you will be good enough to explain how it is that i have received a letter from him today sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised what he roared yes today she stood smiling holding up a little slip of paper in the air may i see it certainly he snatched it from her in his eagerness and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently i had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder the envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day or rather of the day before for it was considerably after midnight coarse writing murmured holmes surely this is not your husbands writing madam no but the enclosure is i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address how can you tell that the name you see is in perfectly black ink which has dried itself the rest is of the greyish colour which shows that blottingpaper has been used if it had been written straight off and then blotted none would be of a deep black shade this man has written the name and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address which can only mean that he was not familiar with it it is of course a trifle but there is nothing so important as trifles let us now see the letter ha there has been an enclosure here yes there was a ring his signetring and you are sure that this is your husbands hand one of his hands one his hand when he wrote hurriedly it is very unlike his usual writing and yet i know it well dearest do not be frightened all will come well there is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify wait in patience neville written in pencil upon the flyleaf of a book octavo size no watermark hum posted today in gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb ha and the flap has been gummed if i am not very much in error by a person who had been chewing tobacco and you have no doubt that it is your husbands hand madam none neville wrote those words and they were posted today at gravesend well mrs st clair the clouds lighten though i should not venture to say that the danger is over but he must be alive mr holmes unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent the ring after all proves nothing it may have been taken from him no no it is it is his very own writing very well it may however have been written on monday and only posted today that is possible if so much may have happened between oh you must not discourage me mr holmes i know that all is well with him there is so keen a sympathy between us that i should know if evil came upon him on the very day that i saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom and yet i in the diningroom rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened do you think that i would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view but if your husband is alive and able to write letters why should he remain away from you i cannot imagine it is unthinkable and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you no and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane very much so was the window open yes then he might have called to you he might he only as i understand gave an inarticulate cry yes a call for help you thought yes he waved his hands but it might have been a cry of surprise astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands it is possible and you thought he was pulled back he disappeared so suddenly he might have leaped back you did not see anyone else in the room no but this horrible man confessed to having been there and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs quite so your husband as far as you could see had his ordinary clothes on but without his collar or tie i distinctly saw his bare throat had he ever spoken of swandam lane never had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium never thank you mrs st clair those are the principal points about which i wished to be absolutely clear we shall now have a little supper and then retire for we may have a very busy day tomorrow a large and comfortable doublebedded room had been placed at our disposal and i was quickly between the sheets for i was weary after my night of adventure sherlock holmes was a man however who when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind would go for days and even for a week without rest turning it over rearranging his facts looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient it was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an allnight sitting he took off his coat and waistcoat put on a large blue dressinggown and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs with these he constructed a sort of eastern divan upon which he perched himself crosslegged with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him in the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there an old briar pipe between his lips his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling the blue smoke curling up from him silent motionless with the light shining upon his strongset aquiline features so he sat as i dropped off to sleep and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up and i found the summer sun shining into the apartment the pipe was still between his lips the smoke still curled upward and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze but nothing remained of the heap of shag which i had seen upon the previous night awake watson he asked yes game for a morning drive certainly then dress no one is stirring yet but i know where the stableboy sleeps and we shall soon have the trap out he chuckled to himself as he spoke his eyes twinkled and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night as i dressed i glanced at my watch it was no wonder that no one was stirring it was twentyfive minutes past four i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse i want to test a little theory of mine said he pulling on his boots i think watson that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe i deserve to be kicked from here to charing cross but i think i have the key of the affair now and where is it i asked smiling in the bathroom he answered oh yes i am not joking he continued seeing my look of incredulity i have just been there and i have taken it out and i have got it in this gladstone bag come on my boy and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible and out into the bright morning sunshine in the road stood our horse and trap with the halfclad stableboy waiting at the head we both sprang in and away we dashed down the london road a few country carts were stirring bearing in vegetables to the metropolis but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream it has been in some points a singular case said holmes flicking the horse on into a gallop i confess that i have been as blind as a mole but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey side passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the river and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in bow street sherlock holmes was well known to the force and the two constables at the door saluted him one of them held the horses head while the other led us in who is on duty asked holmes inspector bradstreet sir ah bradstreet how are you a tall stout official had come down the stoneflagged passage in a peaked cap and frogged jacket i wish to have a quiet word with you bradstreet certainly mr holmes step into my room here it was a small officelike room with a huge ledger upon the table and a telephone projecting from the wall the inspector sat down at his desk what can i do for you mr holmes i called about that beggarman boonethe one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of mr neville st clair of lee yes he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries so i heard you have him here in the cells is he quiet oh he gives no trouble but he is a dirty scoundrel dirty yes it is all we can do to make him wash his hands and his face is as black as a tinkers well when once his case has been settled he will have a regular prison bath and i think if you saw him you would agree with me that he needed it i should like to see him very much would you that is easily done come this way you can leave your bag no i think that ill take it very good come this way if you please he led us down a passage opened a barred door passed down a winding stair and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side the third on the right is his said the inspector here it is he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through he is asleep said he you can see him very well we both put our eyes to the grating the prisoner lay with his face towards us in a very deep sleep breathing slowly and heavily he was a middlesized man coarsely clad as became his calling with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat he was as the inspector had said extremely dirty but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness a broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl a shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead hes a beauty isnt he said the inspector he certainly needs a wash remarked holmes i had an idea that he might and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke and took out to my astonishment a very large bathsponge he he you are a funny one chuckled the inspector now if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure well i dont know why not said the inspector he doesnt look a credit to the bow street cells does he he slipped his key into the lock and we all very quietly entered the cell the sleeper half turned and then settled down once more into a deep slumber holmes stooped to the waterjug moistened his sponge and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoners face let me introduce you he shouted to mr neville st clair of lee in the county of kent never in my life have i seen such a sight the mans face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree gone was the coarse brown tint gone too was the horrid scar which had seamed it across and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face a twitch brought away the tangled red hair and there sitting up in his bed was a pale sadfaced refinedlooking man blackhaired and smoothskinned rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment then suddenly realising the exposure he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow great heavens cried the inspector it is indeed the missing man i know him from the photograph the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny be it so said he and pray what am i charged with with making away with mr neville st oh come you cant be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it said the inspector with a grin well i have been twentyseven years in the force but this really takes the cake if i am mr neville st clair then it is obvious that no crime has been committed and that therefore i am illegally detained no crime but a very great error has been committed said holmes you would have done better to have trusted your wife it was not the wife it was the children groaned the prisoner god help me i would not have them ashamed of their father my god what an exposure what can i do sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up said he of course you can hardly avoid publicity on the other hand if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you i do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers inspector bradstreet would i am sure make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities the case would then never go into court at all god bless you cried the prisoner passionately i would have endured imprisonment ay even execution rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children you are the first who have ever heard my story my father was a schoolmaster in chesterfield where i received an excellent education i travelled in my youth took to the stage and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in london one day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis and i volunteered to supply them there was the point from which all my adventures started it was only by trying begging as an amateur that i could get the facts upon which to base my articles when an actor i had of course learned all the secrets of making up and had been famous in the greenroom for my skill i took advantage now of my attainments i painted my face and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of fleshcoloured plaster then with a red head of hair and an appropriate dress i took my station in the business part of the city ostensibly as a matchseller but really as a beggar for seven hours i plied my trade and when i returned home in the evening i found to my surprise that i had received no less than 26s 4d i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until some time later i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for 25 i was at my wits end where to get the money but a sudden idea came to me i begged a fortnights grace from the creditor asked for a holiday from my employers and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise in ten days i had the money and had paid the debt well you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at 2 a week when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint laying my cap on the ground and sitting still it was a long fight between my pride and the money but the dollars won at last and i threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first chosen inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers only one man knew my secret he was the keeper of a low den in which i used to lodge in swandam lane where i could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a welldressed man about town this fellow a lascar was well paid by me for his rooms so that i knew that my secret was safe in his possession well very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of money i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london could earn 700 a yearwhich is less than my average takingsbut i had exceptional advantages in my power of making up and also in a facility of repartee which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city all day a stream of pennies varied by silver poured in upon me and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take 2 as i grew richer i grew more ambitious took a house in the country and eventually married without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation my dear wife knew that i had business in the city she little knew what last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw to my horror and astonishment that my wife was standing in the street with her eyes fixed full upon me i gave a cry of surprise threw up my arms to cover my face and rushing to my confidant the lascar entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me i heard her voice downstairs but i knew that she could not ascend swiftly i threw off my clothes pulled on those of a beggar and put on my pigments and wig even a wifes eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise but then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room and that the clothes might betray me i threw open the window reopening by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning then i seized my coat which was weighted by the coppers which i had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which i carried my takings i hurled it out of the window and it disappeared into the thames the other clothes would have followed but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair and a few minutes after i found rather i confess to my relief that instead of being identified as mr neville st clair i was arrested as his murderer i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain i was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible and hence my preference for a dirty face knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious i slipped off my ring and confided it to the lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me together with a hurried scrawl telling her that she had no cause to fear that note only reached her yesterday said holmes good god what a week she must have spent the police have watched this lascar said inspector bradstreet and i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his who forgot all about it for some days that was it said holmes nodding approvingly i have no doubt of it but have you never been prosecuted for begging many times but what was a fine to me it must stop here however said bradstreet if the police are to hush this thing up there must be no more of hugh boone i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken but if you are found again then all must come out i am sure mr holmes that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up i wish i knew how you reach your results i reached this one said my friend by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag i think watson that if we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast the adventure of the blue carbuncle i had called upon my friend sherlock holmes upon the second morning after christmas with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season he was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressinggown a piperack within his reach upon the right and a pile of crumpled morning papers evidently newly studied near at hand beside the couch was a wooden chair and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hardfelt hat much the worse for wear and cracked in several places a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination you are engaged said i perhaps i interrupt you not at all i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my results the matter is a perfectly trivial onehe jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hatbut there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction i seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire for a sharp frost had set in and the windows were thick with the ice crystals i suppose i remarked that homely as it looks this thing has some deadly story linked on to itthat it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime no no no crime said sherlock holmes laughing only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity every possible combination of events may be expected to take place and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal we have already had experience of such so much so i remarked that of the last six cases which i have added to my notes three have been entirely free of any legal crime precisely you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler papers to the singular case of miss mary sutherland and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip well i have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category you know peterson the commissionaire yes it is to him that this trophy belongs it is his hat no no he found it its owner is unknown i beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem and first as to how it came here it arrived upon christmas morning in company with a good fat goose which is i have no doubt roasting at this moment in front of petersons fire the facts are these about four oclock on christmas morning peterson who as you know is a very honest fellow was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down tottenham court road in front of him he saw in the gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder as he reached the corner of goodge street a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs one of the latter knocked off the mans hat on which he raised his stick to defend himself and swinging it over his head smashed the shop window behind him peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants but the man shocked at having broken the window and seeing an officiallooking person in uniform rushing towards him dropped his goose took to his heels and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham court road the roughs had also fled at the appearance of peterson so that he was left in possession of the field of battle and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose which surely he restored to their owner my dear fellow there lies the problem it is true that for mrs henry baker was printed upon a small card which was tied to the birds left leg and it is also true that the initials h b are legible upon the lining of this hat but as there are some thousands of bakers and some hundreds of henry bakers in this city of ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them what then did peterson do he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me the goose we retained until this morning when there were signs that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay its finder has carried it off therefore to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose while i continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his christmas dinner did he not advertise no then what clue could you have as to his identity only as much as we can deduce from his hat precisely but you are joking what can you gather from this old battered felt here is my lens you know my methods what can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape hard and much the worse for wear the lining had been of red silk but was a good deal discoloured there was no makers name but as holmes had remarked the initials h b were scrawled upon one side it was pierced in the brim for a hatsecurer but the elastic was missing for the rest it was cracked exceedingly dusty and spotted in several places although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink i can see nothing said i handing it back to my friend on the contrary watson you can see everything you fail however to reason from what you see you are too timid in drawing your inferences then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him it is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been he remarked and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability that the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it and also that he was fairly welltodo within the last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days he had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to a moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink at work upon him this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him my dear holmes he has however retained some degree of selfrespect he continued disregarding my remonstrance he is a man who leads a sedentary life goes out little is out of training entirely is middleaged has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days and which he anoints with limecream these are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat also by the way that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house you are certainly joking holmes not in the least is it possible that even now when i give you these results you are unable to see how they are attained i have no doubt that i am very stupid but i must confess that i am unable to follow you for example how did you deduce that this man was intellectual for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head it came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose it is a question of cubic capacity said he a man with so large a brain must have something in it the decline of his fortunes then this hat is three years old these flat brims curled at the edge came in then it is a hat of the very best quality look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining if this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago and has had no hat since then he has assuredly gone down in the world well that is clear enough certainly but how about the foresight and the moral retrogression sherlock holmes laughed here is the foresight said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hatsecurer they are never sold upon hats if this man ordered one it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind but since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature on the other hand he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his selfrespect your reasoning is certainly plausible the further points that he is middleaged that his hair is grizzled that it has been recently cut and that he uses limecream are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining the lens discloses a large number of hairends clean cut by the scissors of the barber they all appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odour of limecream this dust you will observe is not the gritty grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely and could therefore hardly be in the best of training but his wifeyou said that she had ceased to love him this hat has not been brushed for weeks when i see you my dear watson with a weeks accumulation of dust upon your hat and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state i shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wifes affection but he might be a bachelor nay he was bringing home the goose as a peaceoffering to his wife remember the card upon the birds leg you have an answer to everything but how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house one tallow stain or even two might come by chance but when i see no less than five i think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallowwalks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other anyhow he never got tallowstains from a gasjet are you satisfied well it is very ingenious said i laughing but since as you said just now there has been no crime committed and no harm done save the loss of a goose all this seems to be rather a waste of energy sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply when the door flew open and peterson the commissionaire rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment the goose mr holmes the goose sir he gasped eh what of it then has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the mans excited face see here sir see what my wife found in its crop he held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone rather smaller than a bean in size but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle by jove peterson said he this is treasure trove indeed i suppose you know what you have got a diamond sir a precious stone it cuts into glass as though it were putty its more than a precious stone it is the precious stone not the countess of morcars blue carbuncle i ejaculated precisely so i ought to know its size and shape seeing that i have read the advertisement about it in the times every day lately it is absolutely unique and its value can only be conjectured but the reward offered of 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price a thousand pounds great lord of mercy the commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us that is the reward and i have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem it was lost if i remember aright at the hotel cosmopolitan i remarked precisely so on december 22nd just five days ago john horner a plumber was accused of having abstracted it from the ladys jewelcase the evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the assizes i have some account of the matter here i believe he rummaged amid his newspapers glancing over the dates until at last he smoothed one out doubled it over and read the following paragraph hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery john horner 26 plumber was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst abstracted from the jewelcase of the countess of morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle james ryder upperattendant at the hotel gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown horner up to the dressingroom of the countess of morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate which was loose he had remained with horner some little time but had finally been called away on returning he found that horner had disappeared that the bureau had been forced open and that the small morocco casket in which as it afterwards transpired the countess was accustomed to keep her jewel was lying empty upon the dressingtable ryder instantly gave the alarm and horner was arrested the same evening but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms catherine cusack maid to the countess deposed to having heard ryders cry of dismay on discovering the robbery and to having rushed into the room where she found matters as described by the last witness inspector bradstreet b division gave evidence as to the arrest of horner who struggled frantically and protested his innocence in the strongest terms evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence but referred it to the assizes horner who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court hum so much for the policecourt said holmes thoughtfully tossing aside the paper the question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewelcase at one end to the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other you see watson our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect here is the stone the stone came from the goose and the goose came from mr henry baker the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which i have bored you so now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery to do this we must try the simplest means first and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers if this fail i shall have recourse to other methods what will you say give me a pencil and that slip of paper now then found at the corner of goodge street a goose and a black felt hat mr henry baker can have the same by applying at 630 this evening at 221b baker street that is clear and concise very but will he see it well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to a poor man the loss was a heavy one he was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of nothing but flight but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird then again the introduction of his name will cause him to see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it here you are peterson run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers in which sir oh in the globe star pall mall st jamess evening news standard echo and any others that occur to you very well sir and this stone ah yes i shall keep the stone thank you and i say peterson just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring when the commissionaire had gone holmes took up the stone and held it against the light its a bonny thing said he just see how it glints and sparkles of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime every good stone is they are the devils pet baits in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed this stone is not yet twenty years old it was found in the banks of the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red in spite of its youth it has already a sinister history there have been two murders a vitriolthrowing a suicide and several robberies brought about for the sake of this fortygrain weight of crystallised charcoal who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison ill lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the countess to say that we have it do you think that this man horner is innocent i cannot tell well then do you imagine that this other one henry baker had anything to do with the matter it is i think much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold that however i shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement and you can do nothing until then nothing in that case i shall continue my professional round but i shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned for i should like to see the solution of so tangled a business very glad to see you i dine at seven there is a woodcock i believe by the way in view of recent occurrences perhaps i ought to ask mrs hudson to examine its crop i had been delayed at a case and it was a little after halfpast six when i found myself in baker street once more as i approached the house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight just as i arrived the door was opened and we were shown up together to holmes room mr henry baker i believe said he rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume pray take this chair by the fire mr baker it is a cold night and i observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter ah watson you have just come at the right time is that your hat mr baker yes sir that is undoubtedly my hat he was a large man with rounded shoulders a massive head and a broad intelligent face sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown a touch of red in nose and cheeks with a slight tremor of his extended hand recalled holmes surmise as to his habits his rusty black frockcoat was buttoned right up in front with the collar turned up and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt he spoke in a slow staccato fashion choosing his words with care and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had illusage at the hands of fortune we have retained these things for some days said holmes because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were he remarked i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them very naturally by the way about the bird we were compelled to eat it to eat it our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement yes it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your purpose equally well oh certainly certainly answered mr baker with a sigh of relief of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of your own bird so if you wish the man burst into a hearty laugh they might be useful to me as relics of my adventure said he but beyond that i can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me no sir i think that with your permission i will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon the sideboard sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders there is your hat then and there your bird said he by the way would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from i am somewhat of a fowl fancier and i have seldom seen a better grown goose certainly sir said baker who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm there are a few of us who frequent the alpha inn near the museumwe are to be found in the museum itself during the day you understand this year our good host windigate by name instituted a goose club by which on consideration of some few pence every week we were each to receive a bird at christmas my pence were duly paid and the rest is familiar to you i am much indebted to you sir for a scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way so much for mr henry baker said holmes when he had closed the door behind him it is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter are you hungry watson not particularly then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot by all means it was a bitter night so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats outside the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky and the breath of the passersby blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors quarter wimpole street harley street and so through wigmore street into oxford street in a quarter of an hour we were in bloomsbury at the alpha inn which is a small publichouse at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into holborn holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddyfaced whiteaproned landlord your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese said he my geese the man seemed surprised yes i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr henry baker who was a member of your goose club ah yes i see but you see sir thems not our geese indeed whose then well i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden indeed i know some of them which was it breckinridge is his name ah i dont know him well heres your good health landlord and prosperity to your house goodnight now for mr breckinridge he continued buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air remember watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence it is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt but in any case we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police and which a singular chance has placed in our hands let us follow it out to the bitter end faces to the south then and quick march we passed across holborn down endell street and so through a zigzag of slums to covent garden market one of the largest stalls bore the name of breckinridge upon it and the proprietor a horseylooking man with a sharp face and trim sidewhiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters goodevening its a cold night said holmes the salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion sold out of geese i see continued holmes pointing at the bare slabs of marble let you have five hundred tomorrow morning thats no good well there are some on the stall with the gasflare ah but i was recommended to you who by the landlord of the alpha oh yes i sent him a couple of dozen fine birds they were too now where did you get them from to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman now then mister said he with his head cocked and his arms akimbo what are you driving at lets have it straight now it is straight enough i should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the alpha well then i shant tell you so now oh it is a matter of no importance but i dont know why you should be so warm over such a trifle warm youd be as warm maybe if you were as pestered as i am when i pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business but its where are the geese and who did you sell the geese to and what will you take for the geese one would think they were the only geese in the world to hear the fuss that is made over them well i have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries said holmes carelessly if you wont tell us the bet is off that is all but im always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls and i have a fiver on it that the bird i ate is country bred well then youve lost your fiver for its town bred snapped the salesman its nothing of the kind i say it is i dont believe it dyou think you know more about fowls than i who have handled them ever since i was a nipper i tell you all those birds that went to the alpha were town bred youll never persuade me to believe that will you bet then its merely taking your money for i know that i am right but ill have a sovereign on with you just to teach you not to be obstinate the salesman chuckled grimly bring me the books bill said he the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasybacked one laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp now then mr cocksure said the salesman i thought that i was out of geese but before i finish youll find that there is still one left in my shop you see this little book well thats the list of the folk from whom i buy dyou see well then here on this page are the country folk and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger now then you see this other page in red ink well that is a list of my town suppliers now look at that third name just read it out to me mrs oakshott 117 brixton road249 read holmes quite so now turn that up in the ledger holmes turned to the page indicated here you are mrs oakshott 117 brixton road egg and poultry supplier now then whats the last entry december 22nd twentyfour geese at 7s 6d quite so there you are and underneath sold to mr windigate of the alpha at 12s what have you to say now sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined he drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words a few yards off he stopped under a lamppost and laughed in the hearty noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the pink un protruding out of his pocket you can always draw him by a bet said he i daresay that if i had put 100 down in front of him that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager well watson we are i fancy nearing the end of our quest and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this mrs oakshott tonight or whether we should reserve it for tomorrow it is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter and i should his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left turning round we saw a little ratfaced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp while breckinridge the salesman framed in the door of his stall was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure ive had enough of you and your geese he shouted i wish you were all at the devil together if you come pestering me any more with your silly talk ill set the dog at you you bring mrs oakshott here and ill answer her but what have you to do with it did i buy the geese off you no but one of them was mine all the same whined the little man well then ask mrs oakshott for it she told me to ask you well you can ask the king of proosia for all i care ive had enough of it get out of this he rushed fiercely forward and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness ha this may save us a visit to brixton road whispered holmes come with me and we will see what is to be made of this fellow striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder he sprang round and i could see in the gaslight that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face who are you then what do you want he asked in a quavering voice you will excuse me said holmes blandly but i could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now i think that i could be of assistance to you you who are you how could you know anything of the matter my name is sherlock holmes it is my business to know what other people dont know but you can know nothing of this excuse me i know everything of it you are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by mrs oakshott of brixton road to a salesman named breckinridge by him in turn to mr windigate of the alpha and by him to his club of which mr henry baker is a member oh sir you are the very man whom i have longed to meet cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter sherlock holmes hailed a fourwheeler which was passing in that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this windswept marketplace said he but pray tell me before we go farther who it is that i have the pleasure of assisting the man hesitated for an instant my name is john robinson he answered with a sidelong glance no no the real name said holmes sweetly it is always awkward doing business with an alias a flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger well then said he my real name is james ryder precisely so head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan pray step into the cab and i shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with halffrightened halfhopeful eyes as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe then he stepped into the cab and in half an hour we were back in the sittingroom at baker street nothing had been said during our drive but the high thin breathing of our new companion and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands spoke of the nervous tension within him here we are said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room the fire looks very seasonable in this weather you look cold mr ryder pray take the basketchair i will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours now then you want to know what became of those geese yes sir or rather i fancy of that goose it was one bird i imagine in which you were interestedwhite with a black bar across the tail ryder quivered with emotion oh sir he cried can you tell me where it went to it came here here yes and a most remarkable bird it proved i dont wonder that you should take an interest in it it laid an egg after it was deadthe bonniest brightest little blue egg that ever was seen i have it here in my museum our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand holmes unlocked his strongbox and held up the blue carbuncle which shone out like a star with a cold brilliant manypointed radiance ryder stood glaring with a drawn face uncertain whether to claim or to disown it the games up ryder said holmes quietly hold up man or youll be into the fire give him an arm back into his chair watson hes not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity give him a dash of brandy so now he looks a little more human what a shrimp it is to be sure for a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser i have almost every link in my hands and all the proofs which i could possibly need so there is little which you need tell me still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete you had heard ryder of this blue stone of the countess of morcars it was catherine cusack who told me of it said he in a crackling voice i seeher ladyships waitingmaid well the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you as it has been for better men before you but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used it seems to me ryder that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you you knew that this man horner the plumber had been concerned in some such matter before and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him what did you do then you made some small job in my ladys roomyou and your confederate cusackand you managed that he should be the man sent for then when he had left you rifled the jewelcase raised the alarm and had this unfortunate man arrested you then ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companions knees for gods sake have mercy he shrieked think of my father of my mother it would break their hearts i never went wrong before i never will again i swear it ill swear it on a bible oh dont bring it into court for christs sake dont get back into your chair said holmes sternly it is very well to cringe and crawl now but you thought little enough of this poor horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing i will fly mr holmes i will leave the country sir then the charge against him will break down hum we will talk about that and now let us hear a true account of the next act how came the stone into the goose and how came the goose into the open market tell us the truth for there lies your only hope of safety ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips i will tell you it just as it happened sir said he when horner had been arrested it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once for i did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room there was no place about the hotel where it would be safe i went out as if on some commission and i made for my sisters house she had married a man named oakshott and lived in brixton road where she fattened fowls for the market all the way there every man i met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective and for all that it was a cold night the sweat was pouring down my face before i came to the brixton road my sister asked me what was the matter and why i was so pale but i told her that i had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel then i went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do i had a friend once called maudsley who went to the bad and has just been serving his time in pentonville one day he had met me and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they could get rid of what they stole i knew that he would be true to me for i knew one or two things about him so i made up my mind to go right on to kilburn where he lived and take him into my confidence he would show me how to turn the stone into money but how to get to him in safety i thought of the agonies i had gone through in coming from the hotel i might at any moment be seized and searched and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket i was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how i could beat the best detective that ever lived my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present and i knew that she was always as good as her word i would take my goose now and in it i would carry my stone to kilburn there was a little shed in the yard and behind this i drove one of the birdsa fine big one white with a barred tail i caught it and prying its bill open i thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach the bird gave a gulp and i felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop but the creature flapped and struggled and out came my sister to know what was the matter as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others whatever were you doing with that bird jem says she well said i you said youd give me one for christmas and i was feeling which was the fattest oh says she weve set yours aside for youjems bird we call it its the big white one over yonder theres twentysix of them which makes one for you and one for us and two dozen for the market thank you maggie says i but if it is all the same to you id rather have that one i was handling just now the other is a good three pound heavier said she and we fattened it expressly for you never mind ill have the other and ill take it now said i oh just as you like said she a little huffed which is it you want then that white one with the barred tail right in the middle of the flock oh very well kill it and take it with you well i did what she said mr holmes and i carried the bird all the way to kilburn i told my pal what i had done for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to he laughed until he choked and we got a knife and opened the goose my heart turned to water for there was no sign of the stone and i knew that some terrible mistake had occurred i left the bird rushed back to my sisters and hurried into the back yard there was not a bird to be seen there where are they all maggie i cried gone to the dealers jem which dealers breckinridge of covent garden but was there another with a barred tail i asked the same as the one i chose yes jem there were two barredtailed ones and i could never tell them apart well then of course i saw it all and i ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man breckinridge but he had sold the lot at once and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone you heard him yourselves tonight well he has always answered me like that my sister thinks that i am going mad sometimes i think that i am myself and nowand now i am myself a branded thief without ever having touched the wealth for which i sold my character god help me god help me he burst into convulsive sobbing with his face buried in his hands there was a long silence broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of sherlock holmes fingertips upon the edge of the table then my friend rose and threw open the door get out said he what sir oh heaven bless you no more words get out and no more words were needed there was a rush a clatter upon the stairs the bang of a door and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street after all watson said holmes reaching up his hand for his clay pipe i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies if horner were in danger it would be another thing but this fellow will not appear against him and the case must collapse i suppose that i am commuting a felony but it is just possible that i am saving a soul this fellow will not go wrong again he is too terribly frightened send him to gaol now and you make him a gaolbird for life besides it is the season of forgiveness chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem and its solution is its own reward if you will have the goodness to touch the bell doctor we will begin another investigation in which also a bird will be the chief feature the adventure of the speckled band on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which i have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend sherlock holmes i find many tragic some comic a large number merely strange but none commonplace for working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic of all these varied cases however i cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the wellknown surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran the events in question occurred in the early days of my association with holmes when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in baker street it is possible that i might have placed them upon record before but a promise of secrecy was made at the time from which i have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given it is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light for i have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of dr grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth it was early in april in the year 83 that i woke one morning to find sherlock holmes standing fully dressed by the side of my bed he was a late riser as a rule and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarterpast seven i blinked up at him in some surprise and perhaps just a little resentment for i was myself regular in my habits very sorry to knock you up watson said he but its the common lot this morning mrs hudson has been knocked up she retorted upon me and i on you what is it thena fire no a client it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me she is waiting now in the sittingroom now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their beds i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate should it prove to be an interesting case you would i am sure wish to follow it from the outset i thought at any rate that i should call you and give you the chance my dear fellow i would not miss it for anything i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his professional investigations and in admiring the rapid deductions as swift as intuitions and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him i rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sittingroom a lady dressed in black and heavily veiled who had been sitting in the window rose as we entered goodmorning madam said holmes cheerily my name is sherlock holmes this is my intimate friend and associate dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself ha i am glad to see that mrs hudson has had the good sense to light the fire pray draw up to it and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee for i observe that you are shivering it is not cold which makes me shiver said the woman in a low voice changing her seat as requested what then it is fear mr holmes it is terror she raised her veil as she spoke and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation her face all drawn and grey with restless frightened eyes like those of some hunted animal her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty but her hair was shot with premature grey and her expression was weary and haggard sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick allcomprehensive glances you must not fear said he soothingly bending forward and patting her forearm we shall soon set matters right i have no doubt you have come in by train this morning i see you know me then no but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove you must have started early and yet you had a good drive in a dogcart along heavy roads before you reached the station the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion there is no mystery my dear madam said he smiling the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places the marks are perfectly fresh there is no vehicle save a dogcart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you sit on the lefthand side of the driver whatever your reasons may be you are perfectly correct said she i started from home before six reached leatherhead at twenty past and came in by the first train to waterloo sir i can stand this strain no longer i shall go mad if it continues i have no one to turn tonone save only one who cares for me and he poor fellow can be of little aid i have heard of you mr holmes i have heard of you from mrs farintosh whom you helped in the hour of her sore need it was from her that i had your address oh sir do you not think that you could help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me at present it is out of my power to reward you for your services but in a month or six weeks i shall be married with the control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful holmes turned to his desk and unlocking it drew out a small casebook which he consulted farintosh said he ah yes i recall the case it was concerned with an opal tiara i think it was before your time watson i can only say madam that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend as to reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which suits you best and now i beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter alas replied our visitor the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to another that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman he does not say so but i can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes but i have heard mr holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me i am all attention madam my name is helen stoner and i am living with my stepfather who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of surrey holmes nodded his head the name is familiar to me said he the family was at one time among the richest in england and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north and hampshire in the west in the last century however four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency nothing was left save a few acres of ground and the twohundredyearold house which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage the last squire dragged out his existence there living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper but his only son my stepfather seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions obtained an advance from a relative which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to calcutta where by his professional skill and his force of character he established a large practice in a fit of anger however caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence as it was he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man when dr roylott was in india he married my mother mrs stoner the young widow of majorgeneral stoner of the bengal artillery my sister julia and i were twins and we were only two years old at the time of my mothers remarriage she had a considerable sum of moneynot less than 1000 a yearand this she bequeathed to dr roylott entirely while we resided with him with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage shortly after our return to england my mother diedshe was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe dr roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran the money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of stoke moran back in the old family seat he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family and in my stepfathers case it had i believe been intensified by his long residence in the tropics a series of disgraceful brawls took place two of which ended in the policecourt until at last he became the terror of the village and the folks would fly at his approach for he is a man of immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream and it was only by paying over all the money which i could gather together that i was able to avert another public exposure he had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramblecovered land which represent the family estate and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end he has a passion also for indian animals which are sent over to him by a correspondent and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives no servant would stay with us and for a long time we did all the work of the house she was but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already begun to whiten even as mine has your sister is dead then she died just two years ago and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you you can understand that living the life which i have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position we had however an aunt my mothers maiden sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this ladys house julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there a halfpay major of marines to whom she became engaged my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor pray be precise as to details said he it is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory the manorhouse is as i have already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sittingrooms being in the central block of the buildings of these bedrooms the first is dr roylotts the second my sisters and the third my own there is no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor do i make myself plain perfectly so the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn that fatal night dr roylott had gone to his room early though we knew that he had not retired to rest for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke she left her room therefore and came into mine where she sat for some time chatting about her approaching wedding at eleven oclock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door and looked back tell me helen said she have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night never said i i suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep certainly not but why because during the last few nights i have always about three in the morning heard a low clear whistle i am a light sleeper and it has awakened me i cannot tell where it came fromperhaps from the next room perhaps from the lawn i thought that i would just ask you whether you had heard it no i have not it must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation very likely and yet if it were on the lawn i wonder that you did not hear it also ah but i sleep more heavily than you well it is of no great consequence at any rate she smiled back at me closed my door and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the lock indeed said holmes was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night always and why i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked quite so pray proceed with your statement i could not sleep that night a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me my sister and i you will recollect were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied it was a wild night the wind was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman i knew that it was my sisters voice i sprang from my bed wrapped a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had fallen as i ran down the passage my sisters door was unlocked and revolved slowly upon its hinges i stared at it horrorstricken not knowing what was about to issue from it by the light of the corridorlamp i saw my sister appear at the opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed at first i thought that she had not recognised me but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget oh my god helen it was the band the speckled band there was something else which she would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctors room but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words i rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his dressinggown when he reached my sisters side she was unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister one moment said holmes are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound could you swear to it that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry it is my strong impression that i heard it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house i may possibly have been deceived was your sister dressed no she was in her nightdress in her right hand was found the charred stump of a match and in her left a matchbox showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place that is important and what conclusions did the coroner come to he investigated the case with great care for dr roylotts conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows were blocked by oldfashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night the walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was also thoroughly examined with the same result the chimney is wide but is barred up by four large staples it is certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end besides there were no marks of any violence upon her how about poison the doctors examined her for it but without success what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine were there gipsies in the plantation at the time yes there are nearly always some there ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a banda speckled band sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied these are very deep waters said he pray go on with your narrative two years have passed since then and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever a month ago however a dear friend whom i have known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage his name is armitagepercy armitagethe second son of mr armitage of crane water near reading my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom wall has been pierced so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept imagine then my thrill of terror when last night as i lay awake thinking over her terrible fate i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death i sprang up and lit the lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room i was too shaken to go to bed again however so i dressed and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down got a dogcart at the crown inn which is opposite and drove to leatherhead from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice you have done wisely said my friend but have you told me all yes all miss roylott you have not you are screening your stepfather why what do you mean for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitors knee five little livid spots the marks of four fingers and a thumb were printed upon the white wrist you have been cruelly used said holmes the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist he is a hard man she said and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength there was a long silence during which holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire this is a very deep business he said at last there are a thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action yet we have not a moment to lose if we were to come to stoke moran today would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather as it happens he spoke of coming into town today upon some most important business it is probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you we have a housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and i could easily get her out of the way excellent you are not averse to this trip watson by no means then we shall both come what are you going to do yourself i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town but i shall return by the twelve oclock train so as to be there in time for your coming and you may expect us early in the afternoon i have myself some small business matters to attend to will you not wait and breakfast no i must go my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon she dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room and what do you think of it all watson asked sherlock holmes leaning back in his chair it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business dark enough and sinister enough yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman i cannot think when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughters marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines but what then did the gipsies do i cannot imagine i see many objections to any such theory and so do i it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day i want to see whether the objections are fatal or if they may be explained away but what in the name of the devil the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture his costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural having a black tophat a long frockcoat and a pair of high gaiters with a huntingcrop swinging in his hand so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side a large face seared with a thousand wrinkles burned yellow with the sun and marked with every evil passion was turned from one to the other of us while his deepset bileshot eyes and his high thin fleshless nose gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey which of you is holmes asked this apparition my name sir but you have the advantage of me said my companion quietly i am dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran indeed doctor said holmes blandly pray take a seat i will do nothing of the kind my stepdaughter has been here i have traced her what has she been saying to you it is a little cold for the time of the year said holmes what has she been saying to you screamed the old man furiously but i have heard that the crocuses promise well continued my companion imperturbably ha you put me off do you said our new visitor taking a step forward and shaking his huntingcrop i know you you scoundrel i have heard of you before you are holmes the meddler my friend smiled holmes the busybody his smile broadened holmes the scotland yard jackinoffice holmes chuckled heartily your conversation is most entertaining said he when you go out close the door for there is a decided draught i will go when i have said my say dont you dare to meddle with my affairs i know that miss stoner has been here i traced her i am a dangerous man to fall foul of see here he stepped swiftly forward seized the poker and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands see that you keep yourself out of my grip he snarled and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room he seems a very amiable person said holmes laughing i am not quite so bulky but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own as he spoke he picked up the steel poker and with a sudden effort straightened it out again fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force this incident gives zest to our investigation however and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her and now watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors commons where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter it was nearly one oclock when sherlock holmes returned from his excursion he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper scrawled over with notes and figures i have seen the will of the deceased wife said he to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned the total income which at the time of the wifes death was little short of 1100 is now through the fall in agricultural prices not more than 750 each daughter can claim an income of 250 in case of marriage it is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent my mornings work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort and now watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you are ready we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket an eleys no 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots that and a toothbrush are i think all that we need at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes it was a perfect day with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged my companion sat in the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the deepest thought suddenly however he started tapped me on the shoulder and pointed over the meadows look there said he a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope thickening into a grove at the highest point from amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high rooftree of a very old mansion stoke moran said he yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott remarked the driver there is some building going on there said holmes that is where we are going theres the village said the driver pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left but if you want to get to the house youll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the footpath over the fields there it is where the lady is walking and the lady i fancy is miss stoner observed holmes shading his eyes yes i think we had better do as you suggest we got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead i thought it as well said holmes as we climbed the stile that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or on some definite business it may stop his gossip goodafternoon miss stoner you see that we have been as good as our word our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy i have been waiting so eagerly for you she cried shaking hands with us warmly all has turned out splendidly dr roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening we have had the pleasure of making the doctors acquaintance said holmes and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened good heavens she cried he has followed me then so it appears he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him what will he say when he returns he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track you must lock yourself up from him tonight if he is violent we shall take you away to your aunts at harrow now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine the building was of grey lichenblotched stone with a high central portion and two curving wings like the claws of a crab thrown out on each side in one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards while the roof was partly caved in a picture of ruin the central portion was in little better repair but the righthand block was comparatively modern and the blinds in the windows with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys showed that this was where the family resided some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall and the stonework had been broken into but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit holmes walked slowly up and down the illtrimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows this i take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep the centre one to your sisters and the one next to the main building to dr roylotts chamber exactly so but i am now sleeping in the middle one pending the alterations as i understand by the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall there were none i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room ah that is suggestive now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open there are windows in it of course yes but very small ones too narrow for anyone to pass through as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters miss stoner did so and holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open but without success there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar then with his lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built firmly into the massive masonry hum said he scratching his chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some difficulties no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened holmes refused to examine the third chamber so we passed at once to the second that in which miss stoner was now sleeping and in which her sister had met with her fate it was a homely little room with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace after the fashion of old countryhouses a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner a narrow whitecounterpaned bed in another and a dressingtable on the lefthand side of the window these articles with two small wickerwork chairs made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre the boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown wormeaten oak so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down taking in every detail of the apartment where does that bell communicate with he asked at last pointing to a thick bellrope which hung down beside the bed the tassel actually lying upon the pillow it goes to the housekeepers room it looks newer than the other things yes it was only put there a couple of years ago your sister asked for it i suppose no i never heard of her using it we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bellpull there you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward examining minutely the cracks between the boards then he did the same with the woodwork with which the chamber was panelled finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall finally he took the bellrope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug why its a dummy said he wont it ring no it is not even attached to a wire this is very interesting you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is how very absurd i never noticed that before very strange muttered holmes pulling at the rope there are one or two very singular points about this room for example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air that is also quite modern said the lady done about the same time as the bellrope remarked holmes yes there were several little changes carried out about that time they seem to have been of a most interesting characterdummy bellropes and ventilators which do not ventilate with your permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment dr grimesby roylotts chamber was larger than that of his stepdaughter but was as plainly furnished a campbed a small wooden shelf full of books mostly of a technical character an armchair beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a round table and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest whats in here he asked tapping the safe my stepfathers business papers oh you have seen inside then only once some years ago i remember that it was full of papers there isnt a cat in it for example no what a strange idea well look at this he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it no we dont keep a cat but there is a cheetah and a baboon ah yes of course well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i daresay there is one point which i should wish to determine he squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention thank you that is quite settled said he rising and putting his lens in his pocket hullo here is something interesting the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed the lash however was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord what do you make of that watson its a common enough lash but i dont know why it should be tied that is not quite so common is it ah me its a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn i had never seen my friends face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation we had walked several times up and down the lawn neither miss stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie it is very essential miss stoner said he that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect i shall most certainly do so the matter is too serious for any hesitation your life may depend upon your compliance i assure you that i am in your hands in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in your room both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment yes it must be so let me explain i believe that that is the village inn over there yes that is the crown very good your windows would be visible from there certainly you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy i have no doubt that in spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night oh yes easily the rest you will leave in our hands but what will you do we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you i believe mr holmes that you have already made up your mind said miss stoner laying her hand upon my companions sleeve perhaps i have then for pitys sake tell me what was the cause of my sisters death i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright no i do not think so i think that there was probably some more tangible cause and now miss stoner we must leave you for if dr roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain goodbye and be brave for if you will do what i have told you you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sittingroom at the crown inn they were on the upper floor and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate and of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house at dusk we saw dr grimesby roylott drive past his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him the boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctors voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him the trap drove on and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sittingrooms do you know watson said holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness i have really some scruples as to taking you tonight there is a distinct element of danger can i be of assistance your presence might be invaluable then i shall certainly come it is very kind of you you speak of danger you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me no but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more i imagine that you saw all that i did i saw nothing remarkable save the bellrope and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine you saw the ventilator too yes but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran my dear holmes oh yes i did you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr roylotts cigar now of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms it could only be a small one or it would have been remarked upon at the coroners inquiry i deduced a ventilator but what harm can there be in that well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates a ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies does not that strike you i cannot as yet see any connection did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed no it was clamped to the floor did you ever see a bed fastened like that before i cannot say that i have the lady could not move her bed it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the ropeor so we may call it since it was clearly never meant for a bellpull holmes i cried i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime subtle enough and horrible enough when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals he has nerve and he has knowledge palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession this man strikes even deeper but i think watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over for goodness sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful about nine oclock the light among the trees was extinguished and all was dark in the direction of the manor house two hours passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us that is our signal said holmes springing to his feet it comes from the middle window as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance and that it was possible that we might spend the night there a moment later we were out on the dark road a chill wind blowing in our faces and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand there was little difficulty in entering the grounds for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall making our way among the trees we reached the lawn crossed it and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness my god i whispered did you see it holmes was for the moment as startled as i his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear it is a nice household he murmured that is the baboon i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected there was a cheetah too perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment i confess that i felt easier in my mind when after following holmes example and slipping off my shoes i found myself inside the bedroom my companion noiselessly closed the shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes round the room all was as we had seen it in the daytime then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to distinguish the words the least sound would be fatal to our plans i nodded to show that i had heard we must sit without light he would see it through the ventilator i nodded again do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it have your pistol ready in case we should need it i will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table holmes had brought up a long thin cane and this he placed upon the bed beside him by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle then he turned down the lamp and we were left in darkness how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil i could not hear a sound not even the drawing of a breath and yet i knew that my companion sat openeyed within a few feet of me in the same state of nervous tension in which i was myself the shutters cut off the least ray of light and we waited in absolute darkness from outside came the occasional cry of a nightbird and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of an hour how long they seemed those quarters twelve struck and one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal someone in the next room had lit a darklantern i heard a gentle sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger for half an hour i sat with straining ears then suddenly another sound became audiblea very gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle the instant that we heard it holmes sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bellpull you see it watson he yelled you see it but i saw nothing at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely i could however see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened it swelled up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek they say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the sleepers from their beds it struck cold to our hearts and i stood gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose what can it mean i gasped it means that it is all over holmes answered and perhaps after all it is for the best take your pistol and we will enter dr roylotts room with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within then he turned the handle and entered i at his heels with the cocked pistol in my hand it was a singular sight which met our eyes on the table stood a darklantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar beside this table on the wooden chair sat dr grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressinggown his bare ankles protruding beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his head as we entered he made neither sound nor motion the band the speckled band whispered holmes i took a step forward in an instant his strange headgear began to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamondshaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent it is a swamp adder cried holmes the deadliest snake in india he has died within ten seconds of being bitten violence does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened as he spoke he drew the dogwhip swiftly from the dead mans lap and throwing the noose round the reptiles neck he drew it from its horrid perch and carrying it at arms length threw it into the iron safe which he closed upon it such are the true facts of the death of dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day i had said he come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data the presence of the gipsies and the use of the word band which was used by the poor girl no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent i can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsidered my position when however it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door my attention was speedily drawn as i have already remarked to you to this ventilator and to the bellrope which hung down to the bed the discovery that this was a dummy and that the bed was clamped to the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india i felt that i was probably on the right track the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be an advantage it would be a sharpeyed coroner indeed who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work then i thought of the whistle of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim he had trained it probably by the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summoned he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed it might or might not bite the occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the light and attacked it with the result of driving it through the ventilator and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person it saw in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr grimesby roylotts death and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience the adventure of the engineers thumb of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend mr sherlock holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy there were only two which i was the means of introducing to his noticethat of mr hatherleys thumb and that of colonel warburtons madness of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results the story has i believe been told more than once in the newspapers but like all such narratives its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single halfcolumn of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth at the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect it was in the summer of 89 not long after my marriage that the events occurred which i am now about to summarise i had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street rooms although i continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us my practice had steadily increased and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station i got a few patients from among the officials one of these whom i had cured of a painful and lingering disease was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence one morning at a little before seven oclock i was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consultingroom i dressed hurriedly for i knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial and hastened downstairs as i descended my old ally the guard came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him ive got him here he whispered jerking his thumb over his shoulder hes all right what is it then i asked for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room its a new patient he whispered i thought id bring him round myself then he couldnt slip away there he is all safe and sound i must go now doctor i have my dooties just the same as you and off he went this trusty tout without even giving me time to thank him i entered my consultingroom and found a gentleman seated by the table he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped which was mottled all over with bloodstains he was young not more than fiveandtwenty i should say with a strong masculine face but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation which it took all his strength of mind to control i am sorry to knock you up so early doctor said he but i have had a very serious accident during the night i came in by train this morning and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a doctor a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here i gave the maid a card but i see that she has left it upon the sidetable i took it up and glanced at it mr victor hatherley hydraulic engineer 16a victoria street 3rd floor that was the name style and abode of my morning visitor i regret that i have kept you waiting said i sitting down in my librarychair you are fresh from a night journey i understand which is in itself a monotonous occupation oh my night could not be called monotonous said he and laughed he laughed very heartily with a high ringing note leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides all my medical instincts rose up against that laugh stop it i cried pull yourself together and i poured out some water from a caraffe it was useless however he was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone presently he came to himself once more very weary and palelooking i have been making a fool of myself he gasped not at all drink this i dashed some brandy into the water and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks thats better said he and now doctor perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb or rather to the place where my thumb used to be he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand it gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it there were four protruding fingers and a horrid red spongy surface where the thumb should have been it had been hacked or torn right out from the roots good heavens i cried this is a terrible injury it must have bled considerably yes it did i fainted when it was done and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time when i came to i found that it was still bleeding so i tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig excellent you should have been a surgeon it is a question of hydraulics you see and came within my own province this has been done said i examining the wound by a very heavy and sharp instrument a thing like a cleaver said he an accident i presume by no means what a murderous attack very murderous indeed you horrify me i sponged the wound cleaned it dressed it and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages he lay back without wincing though he bit his lip from time to time how is that i asked when i had finished capital between your brandy and your bandage i feel a new man i was very weak but i have had a good deal to go through perhaps you had better not speak of the matter it is evidently trying to your nerves oh no not now i shall have to tell my tale to the police but between ourselves if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine i should be surprised if they believed my statement for it is a very extraordinary one and i have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up and even if they believe me the clues which i can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done ha cried i if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved i should strongly recommend you to come to my friend mr sherlock holmes before you go to the official police oh i have heard of that fellow answered my visitor and i should be very glad if he would take the matter up though of course i must use the official police as well would you give me an introduction to him ill do better ill take you round to him myself i should be immensely obliged to you well call a cab and go together we shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him do you feel equal to it yes i shall not feel easy until i have told my story then my servant will call a cab and i shall be with you in an instant i rushed upstairs explained the matter shortly to my wife and in five minutes was inside a hansom driving with my new acquaintance to baker street sherlock holmes was as i expected lounging about his sittingroom in his dressinggown reading the agony column of the times and smoking his beforebreakfast pipe which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece he received us in his quietly genial fashion ordered fresh rashers and eggs and joined us in a hearty meal when it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa placed a pillow beneath his head and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach it is easy to see that your experience has been no common one mr hatherley said he pray lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home tell us what you can but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant thank you said my patient but i have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me and i think that your breakfast has completed the cure i shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible so i shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary heavylidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature while i sat opposite to him and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us you must know said he that i am an orphan and a bachelor residing alone in lodgings in london by profession i am a hydraulic engineer and i have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that i was apprenticed to venner matheson the wellknown firm of greenwich two years ago having served my time and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor fathers death i determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in victoria street i suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience to me it has been exceptionally so during two years i have had three consultations and one small job and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me my gross takings amount to 27 10s every day from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon i waited in my little den until at last my heart began to sink and i came to believe that i should never have any practice at all yesterday however just as i was thinking of leaving the office my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business he brought up a card too with the name of colonel lysander stark engraved upon it close at his heels came the colonel himself a man rather over the middle size but of an exceeding thinness i do not think that i have ever seen so thin a man his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit and due to no disease for his eye was bright his step brisk and his bearing assured he was plainly but neatly dressed and his age i should judge would be nearer forty than thirty mr hatherley said he with something of a german accent you have been recommended to me mr hatherley as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret i bowed feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address may i ask who it was who gave me so good a character well perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just at this moment i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in london that is quite correct i answered but you will excuse me if i say that i cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications i understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me undoubtedly so but you will find that all i say is really to the point i have a professional commission for you but absolute secrecy is quite essentialabsolute secrecy you understand and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family if i promise to keep a secret said i you may absolutely depend upon my doing so he looked very hard at me as i spoke and it seemed to me that i had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye do you promise then said he at last yes i promise absolute and complete silence before during and after no reference to the matter at all either in word or writing i have already given you my word very good he suddenly sprang up and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door the passage outside was empty thats all right said he coming back i know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their masters affairs now we can talk in safety he drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look a feeling of repulsion and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience i beg that you will state your business sir said i my time is of value heaven forgive me for that last sentence but the words came to my lips how would fifty guineas for a nights work suit you he asked most admirably i say a nights work but an hours would be nearer the mark i simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear if you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves what do you think of such a commission as that the work appears to be light and the pay munificent precisely so we shall want you to come tonight by the last train where to to eyford in berkshire it is a little place near the borders of oxfordshire and within seven miles of reading there is a train from paddington which would bring you there at about 1115 very good i shall come down in a carriage to meet you there is a drive then yes our little place is quite out in the country it is a good seven miles from eyford station then we can hardly get there before midnight i suppose there would be no chance of a train back i should be compelled to stop the night yes we could easily give you a shakedown that is very awkward could i not come at some more convenient hour we have judged it best that you should come late it is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you a young and unknown man a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession still of course if you would like to draw out of the business there is plenty of time to do so i thought of the fifty guineas and of how very useful they would be to me not at all said i i shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes i should like however to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do quite so it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity i have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you i suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers entirely then the matter stands thus you are probably aware that fullersearth is a valuable product and that it is only found in one or two places in england i have heard so some little time ago i bought a small placea very small placewithin ten miles of reading i was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fullersearth in one of my fields on examining it however i found that this deposit was a comparatively small one and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and leftboth of them however in the grounds of my neighbours these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a goldmine naturally it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value but unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this i took a few of my friends into the secret however and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields this we have now been doing for some time and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press this press as i have already explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the subject we guard our secret very jealously however and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house it would soon rouse inquiry and then if the facts came out it would be goodbye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans that is why i have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to eyford tonight i hope that i make it all plain i quite follow you said i the only point which i could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fullersearth which as i understand is dug out like gravel from a pit ah said he carelessly we have our own process we compress the earth into bricks so as to remove them without revealing what they are but that is a mere detail i have taken you fully into my confidence now mr hatherley and i have shown you how i trust you he rose as he spoke i shall expect you then at eyford at 1115 i shall certainly be there and not a word to a soul he looked at me with a last long questioning gaze and then pressing my hand in a cold dank grasp he hurried from the room well when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was very much astonished as you may both think at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me on the one hand of course i was glad for the fee was at least tenfold what i should have asked had i set a price upon my own services and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones on the other hand the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me and i could not think that his explanation of the fullersearth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight and his extreme anxiety lest i should tell anyone of my errand however i threw all fears to the winds ate a hearty supper drove to paddington and started off having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue at reading i had to change not only my carriage but my station however i was in time for the last train to eyford and i reached the little dimlit station after eleven oclock i was the only passenger who got out there and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern as i passed out through the wicket gate however i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage the door of which was standing open he drew up the windows on either side tapped on the woodwork and away we went as fast as the horse could go one horse interjected holmes yes only one did you observe the colour yes i saw it by the sidelights when i was stepping into the carriage it was a chestnut tiredlooking or fresh oh fresh and glossy thank you i am sorry to have interrupted you pray continue your most interesting statement away we went then and we drove for at least an hour colonel lysander stark had said that it was only seven miles but i should think from the rate that we seemed to go and from the time that we took that it must have been nearer twelve he sat at my side in silence all the time and i was aware more than once when i glanced in his direction that he was looking at me with great intensity the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world for we lurched and jolted terribly i tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were but they were made of frosted glass and i could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light now and then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey but the colonel answered only in monosyllables and the conversation soon flagged at last however the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a graveldrive and the carriage came to a stand colonel lysander stark sprang out and as i followed after him pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us we stepped as it were right out of the carriage and into the hall so that i failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away it was pitch dark inside the house and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage and a long golden bar of light shot out in our direction it grew broader and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand which she held above her head pushing her face forward and peering at us i could see that she was pretty and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich material she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand colonel stark went up to her whispered something in her ear and then pushing her back into the room from whence she had come he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes said he throwing open another door it was a quiet little plainly furnished room with a round table in the centre on which several german books were scattered colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door i shall not keep you waiting an instant said he and vanished into the darkness i glanced at the books upon the table and in spite of my ignorance of german i could see that two of them were treatises on science the others being volumes of poetry then i walked across to the window hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the countryside but an oak shutter heavily barred was folded across it it was a wonderfully silent house there was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage but otherwise everything was deadly still a vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me who were these german people and what were they doing living in this strange outoftheway place and where was the place i was ten miles or so from eyford that was all i knew but whether north south east or west i had no idea for that matter reading and possibly other large towns were within that radius so the place might not be so secluded after all yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness that we were in the country i paced up and down the room humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that i was thoroughly earning my fiftyguinea fee suddenly without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness the door of my room swung slowly open the woman was standing in the aperture the darkness of the hall behind her the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart she held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent and she shot a few whispered words of broken english at me her eyes glancing back like those of a frightened horse into the gloom behind her i would go said she trying hard as it seemed to me to speak calmly i would go i should not stay here there is no good for you to do but madam said i i have not yet done what i came for i cannot possibly leave until i have seen the machine it is not worth your while to wait she went on you can pass through the door no one hinders and then seeing that i smiled and shook my head she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward with her hands wrung together for the love of heaven she whispered get away from here before it is too late but i am somewhat headstrong by nature and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way i thought of my fiftyguinea fee of my wearisome journey and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me was it all to go for nothing why should i slink away without having carried out my commission and without the payment which was my due this woman might for all i knew be a monomaniac with a stout bearing therefore though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs she listened for an instant threw up her hands with a despairing gesture and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come the newcomers were colonel lysander stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin who was introduced to me as mr ferguson this is my secretary and manager said the colonel by the way i was under the impression that i left this door shut just now i fear that you have felt the draught on the contrary said i i opened the door myself because i felt the room to be a little close he shot one of his suspicious looks at me perhaps we had better proceed to business then said he mr ferguson and i will take you up to see the machine i had better put my hat on i suppose oh no it is in the house what you dig fullersearth in the house no no this is only where we compress it but never mind that all we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it we went upstairs together the colonel first with the lamp the fat manager and i behind him it was a labyrinth of an old house with corridors passages narrow winding staircases and little low doors the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor while the plaster was peeling off the walls and the damp was breaking through in green unhealthy blotches i tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible but i had not forgotten the warnings of the lady even though i disregarded them and i kept a keen eye upon my two companions ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellowcountryman colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door which he unlocked within was a small square room in which the three of us could hardly get at one time ferguson remained outside and the colonel ushered me in we are now said he actually within the hydraulic press and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you the machine goes readily enough but there is some stiffness in the working of it and it has lost a little of its force perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right i took the lamp from him and i examined the machine very thoroughly it was indeed a gigantic one and capable of exercising enormous pressure when i passed outside however and pressed down the levers which controlled it i knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders an examination showed that one of the indiarubber bands which was round the head of a drivingrod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked this was clearly the cause of the loss of power and i pointed it out to my companions who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right when i had made it clear to them i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity it was obvious at a glance that the story of the fullersearth was the merest fabrication for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose the walls were of wood but the floor consisted of a large iron trough and when i came to examine it i could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it i had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me what are you doing there he asked i felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me i was admiring your fullersearth said i i think that i should be better able to advise you as to your machine if i knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used the instant that i uttered the words i regretted the rashness of my speech his face set hard and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes very well said he you shall know all about the machine he took a step backward slammed the little door and turned the key in the lock i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle but it was quite secure and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves hullo i yelled hullo colonel let me out and then suddenly in the silence i heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder he had set the engine at work the lamp still stood upon the floor where i had placed it when examining the trough by its light i saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me slowly jerkily but as none knew better than myself with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp i threw myself screaming against the door and dragged with my nails at the lock i implored the colonel to let me out but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head and with my hand upraised i could feel its hard rough surface then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it if i lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap easier the other way perhaps and yet had i the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me already i was unable to stand erect when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron the walls were of wood as i gave a last hurried glance around i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward for an instant i could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death the next instant i threw myself through and lay halffainting upon the other side the panel had closed again behind me but the crash of the lamp and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal told me how narrow had been my escape i was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist and i found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand while she held a candle in her right it was the same good friend whose warning i had so foolishly rejected come come she cried breathlessly they will be here in a moment they will see that you are not there oh do not waste the soprecious time but come this time at least i did not scorn her advice i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair the latter led to another broad passage and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath my guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wits end then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom through the window of which the moon was shining brightly it is your only chance said she it is high but it may be that you can jump it as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage and i saw the lean figure of colonel lysander stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butchers cleaver in the other i rushed across the bedroom flung open the window and looked out how quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight and it could not be more than thirty feet down i clambered out upon the sill but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me if she were illused then at any risks i was determined to go back to her assistance the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door pushing his way past her but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back fritz fritz she cried in english remember your promise after the last time you said it should not be again he will be silent oh he will be silent you are mad elise he shouted struggling to break away from her you will be the ruin of us he has seen too much let me pass i say he dashed her to one side and rushing to the window cut at me with his heavy weapon i had let myself go and was hanging by the hands to the sill when his blow fell i was conscious of a dull pain my grip loosened and i fell into the garden below i was shaken but not hurt by the fall so i picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as i could run for i understood that i was far from being out of danger yet suddenly however as i ran a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me i glanced down at my hand which was throbbing painfully and then for the first time saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rosebushes how long i remained unconscious i cannot tell it must have been a very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was breaking when i came to myself my clothes were all sodden with dew and my coatsleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my nights adventure and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers but to my astonishment when i came to look round me neither house nor garden were to be seen i had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad and just a little lower down was a long building which proved upon my approaching it to be the very station at which i had arrived upon the previous night were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream half dazed i went into the station and asked about the morning train there would be one to reading in less than an hour the same porter was on duty i found as had been there when i arrived i inquired of him whether he had ever heard of colonel lysander stark the name was strange to him had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me no he had not was there a policestation anywhere near there was one about three miles off it was too far for me to go weak and ill as i was i determined to wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the police it was a little past six when i arrived so i went first to have my wound dressed and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here i put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative then sherlock holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings here is an advertisement which will interest you said he it appeared in all the papers about a year ago listen to this lost on the 9th inst mr jeremiah hayling aged twentysix a hydraulic engineer left his lodgings at ten oclock at night and has not been heard of since was dressed in etc etc ha that represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled i fancy good heavens cried my patient then that explains what the girl said undoubtedly it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game like those outandout pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship well every moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for eyford some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together bound from reading to the little berkshire village there were sherlock holmes the hydraulic engineer inspector bradstreet of scotland yard a plainclothes man and myself bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with eyford for its centre there you are said he that circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village the place we want must be somewhere near that line you said ten miles i think sir it was an hours good drive and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious they must have done so i have a confused memory too of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere what i cannot understand said i is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden perhaps the villain was softened by the womans entreaties i hardly think that likely i never saw a more inexorable face in my life oh we shall soon clear up all that said bradstreet well i have drawn my circle and i only wish i knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found i think i could lay my finger on it said holmes quietly really now cried the inspector you have formed your opinion come now we shall see who agrees with you i say it is south for the country is more deserted there and i say east said my patient i am for west remarked the plainclothes man there are several quiet little villages up there and i am for north said i because there are no hills there and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any come cried the inspector laughing its a very pretty diversity of opinion we have boxed the compass among us who do you give your casting vote to you are all wrong but we cant all be oh yes you can this is my point he placed his finger in the centre of the circle this is where we shall find them but the twelvemile drive gasped hatherley six out and six back nothing simpler you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in how could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads indeed it is a likely ruse enough observed bradstreet thoughtfully of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang none at all said holmes they are coiners on a large scale and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work said the inspector they have been turning out halfcrowns by the thousand we even traced them as far as reading but could get no farther for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands but now thanks to this lucky chance i think that we have got them right enough but the inspector was mistaken for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice as we rolled into eyford station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape a house on fire asked bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way yes sir said the stationmaster when did it break out i hear that it was during the night sir but it has got worse and the whole place is in a blaze whose house is it dr bechers tell me broke in the engineer is dr becher a german very thin with a long sharp nose the stationmaster laughed heartily no sir dr becher is an englishman and there isnt a man in the parish who has a betterlined waistcoat but he has a gentleman staying with him a patient as i understand who is a foreigner and he looks as if a little good berkshire beef would do him no harm the stationmaster had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire the road topped a low hill and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us spouting fire at every chink and window while in the garden in front three fireengines were vainly striving to keep the flames under thats it cried hatherley in intense excitement there is the graveldrive and there are the rosebushes where i lay that second window is the one that i jumped from well at least said holmes you have had your revenge upon them there can be no question that it was your oillamp which when it was crushed in the press set fire to the wooden walls though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night though i very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now and holmes fears came to be realised for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman the sinister german or the morose englishman early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of reading but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared and even holmes ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a windowsill of the second floor about sunset however their efforts were at last successful and they subdued the flames but not before the roof had fallen in and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that save some twisted cylinders and iron piping not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an outhouse but no coins were to be found which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould which told us a very plain tale he had evidently been carried down by two persons one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones on the whole it was most probable that the silent englishman being less bold or less murderous than his companion had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger well said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to london it has been a pretty business for me i have lost my thumb and i have lost a fiftyguinea fee and what have i gained experience said holmes laughing indirectly it may be of value you know you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence the adventure of the noble bachelor the lord st simon marriage and its curious termination have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves fresh scandals have eclipsed it and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this fouryearold drama as i have reason to believe however that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public and as my friend sherlock holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up i feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode it was a few weeks before my own marriage during the days when i was still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him i had remained indoors all day for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain with high autumnal winds and the jezail bullet which i had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence with my body in one easychair and my legs upon another i had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last saturated with the news of the day i tossed them all aside and lay listless watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friends noble correspondent could be here is a very fashionable epistle i remarked as he entered your morning letters if i remember right were from a fishmonger and a tidewaiter yes my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety he answered smiling and the humbler are usually the more interesting this looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie he broke the seal and glanced over the contents oh come it may prove to be something of interest after all not social then no distinctly professional and from a noble client one of the highest in england my dear fellow i congratulate you i assure you watson without affectation that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case it is just possible however that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation you have been reading the papers diligently of late have you not it looks like it said i ruefully pointing to a huge bundle in the corner i have had nothing else to do it is fortunate for you will perhaps be able to post me up i read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column the latter is always instructive but if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about lord st simon and his wedding oh yes with the deepest interest that is well the letter which i hold in my hand is from lord st simon i will read it to you and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter this is what he says my dear mr sherlock holmes lord backwater tells me that i may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion i have determined therefore to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding mr lestrade of scotland yard is acting already in the matter but he assures me that he sees no objection to your cooperation and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance i will call at four oclock in the afternoon and should you have any other engagement at that time i hope that you will postpone it as this matter is of paramount importance yours faithfully st simon it is dated from grosvenor mansions written with a quill pen and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger remarked holmes as he folded up the epistle he says four oclock it is three now he will be here in an hour then i have just time with your assistance to get clear upon the subject turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time while i take a glance as to who our client is he picked a redcovered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece here he is said he sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee lord robert walsingham de vere st simon second son of the duke of balmoral hum arms azure three caltrops in chief over a fess sable born in 1846 hes fortyone years of age which is mature for marriage was undersecretary for the colonies in a late administration the duke his father was at one time secretary for foreign affairs they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent and tudor on the distaff side ha well there is nothing very instructive in all this i think that i must turn to you watson for something more solid i have very little difficulty in finding what i want said i for the facts are quite recent and the matter struck me as remarkable i feared to refer them to you however as i knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters oh you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square furniture van that is quite cleared up nowthough indeed it was obvious from the first pray give me the results of your newspaper selections here is the first notice which i can find it is in the personal column of the morning post and dates as you see some weeks back a marriage has been arranged it says and will if rumour is correct very shortly take place between lord robert st simon second son of the duke of balmoral and miss hatty doran the only daughter of aloysius doran esq of san francisco cal usa that is all terse and to the point remarked holmes stretching his long thin legs towards the fire there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week ah here it is there will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market for the present freetrade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic an important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders lord st simon who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little gods arrows has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with miss hatty doran the fascinating daughter of a california millionaire miss doran whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the westbury house festivities is an only child and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures with expectancies for the future as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years and as lord st simon has no property of his own save the small estate of birchmoor it is obvious that the californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a republican lady to a british peeress anything else asked holmes yawning oh yes plenty then there is another note in the morning post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one that it would be at st georges hanover square that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited and that the party would return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been taken by mr aloysius doran two days laterthat is on wednesday lastthere is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place and that the honeymoon would be passed at lord backwaters place near petersfield those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride before the what asked holmes with a start the vanishing of the lady when did she vanish then at the wedding breakfast indeed this is more interesting than it promised to be quite dramatic in fact yes it struck me as being a little out of the common they often vanish before the ceremony and occasionally during the honeymoon but i cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this pray let me have the details i warn you that they are very incomplete perhaps we may make them less so such as they are they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday which i will read to you it is headed singular occurrence at a fashionable wedding the family of lord robert st simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding the ceremony as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday occurred on the previous morning but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about in spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation the ceremony which was performed at st georges hanover square was a very quiet one no one being present save the father of the bride mr aloysius doran the duchess of balmoral lord backwater lord eustace and lady clara st simon the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom and lady alicia whittington the whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of mr aloysius doran at lancaster gate where breakfast had been prepared it appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman whose name has not been ascertained who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party alleging that she had some claim upon lord st simon it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman the bride who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption had sat down to breakfast with the rest when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room her prolonged absence having caused some comment her father followed her but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant caught up an ulster and bonnet and hurried down to the passage one of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled but had refused to credit that it was his mistress believing her to be with the company on ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared mr aloysius doran in conjunction with the bridegroom instantly put themselves in communication with the police and very energetic inquiries are being made which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business up to a late hour last night however nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady there are rumours of foul play in the matter and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance in the belief that from jealousy or some other motive she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride and is that all only one little item in another of the morning papers but it is a suggestive one and it is that miss flora millar the lady who had caused the disturbance has actually been arrested it appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the allegro and that she has known the bridegroom for some years there are no further particulars and the whole case is in your hands nowso far as it has been set forth in the public press and an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be i would not have missed it for worlds but there is a ring at the bell watson and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four i have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client do not dream of going watson for i very much prefer having a witness if only as a check to my own memory lord robert st simon announced our pageboy throwing open the door a gentleman entered with a pleasant cultured face highnosed and pale with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth and with the steady wellopened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed his manner was brisk and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked his hair too as he swept off his very curlybrimmed hat was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top as to his dress it was careful to the verge of foppishness with high collar black frockcoat white waistcoat yellow gloves patentleather shoes and lightcoloured gaiters he advanced slowly into the room turning his head from left to right and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses goodday lord st simon said holmes rising and bowing pray take the basketchair this is my friend and colleague dr watson draw up a little to the fire and we will talk this matter over a most painful matter to me as you can most readily imagine mr holmes i have been cut to the quick i understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort sir though i presume that they were hardly from the same class of society no i am descending i beg pardon my last client of the sort was a king oh really i had no idea and which king the king of scandinavia what had he lost his wife you can understand said holmes suavely that i extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which i promise to you in yours of course very right very right im sure i beg pardon as to my own case i am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion thank you i have already learned all that is in the public prints nothing more i presume that i may take it as correctthis article for example as to the disappearance of the bride lord st simon glanced over it yes it is correct as far as it goes but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion i think that i may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you pray do so when did you first meet miss hatty doran in san francisco a year ago you were travelling in the states yes did you become engaged then no but you were on a friendly footing i was amused by her society and she could see that i was amused her father is very rich he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope and how did he make his money in mining he had nothing a few years ago then he struck gold invested it and came up by leaps and bounds now what is your own impression as to the young ladysyour wifes character the nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire you see mr holmes said he my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man during that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains so that her education has come from nature rather than from the schoolmaster she is what we call in england a tomboy with a strong nature wild and free unfettered by any sort of traditions she is impetuousvolcanic i was about to say she is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions on the other hand i would not have given her the name which i have the honour to bearhe gave a little stately coughhad i not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman i believe that she is capable of heroic selfsacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her have you her photograph i brought this with me he opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman it was not a photograph but an ivory miniature and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair the large dark eyes and the exquisite mouth holmes gazed long and earnestly at it then he closed the locket and handed it back to lord st simon the young lady came to london then and you renewed your acquaintance yes her father brought her over for this last london season i met her several times became engaged to her and have now married her she brought i understand a considerable dowry a fair dowry not more than is usual in my family and this of course remains to you since the marriage is a fait accompli i really have made no inquiries on the subject very naturally not did you see miss doran on the day before the wedding yes was she in good spirits never better she kept talking of what we should do in our future lives indeed that is very interesting and on the morning of the wedding she was as bright as possibleat least until after the ceremony and did you observe any change in her then well to tell the truth i saw then the first signs that i had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp the incident however was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case pray let us have it for all that oh it is childish she dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry she was passing the front pew at the time and it fell over into the pew there was a moments delay but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall yet when i spoke to her of the matter she answered me abruptly and in the carriage on our way home she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause indeed you say that there was a gentleman in the pew some of the general public were present then oh yes it is impossible to exclude them when the church is open this gentleman was not one of your wifes friends no no i call him a gentleman by courtesy but he was quite a commonlooking person i hardly noticed his appearance but really i think that we are wandering rather far from the point lady st simon then returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it what did she do on reentering her fathers house i saw her in conversation with her maid and who is her maid alice is her name she is an american and came from california with her a confidential servant a little too much so it seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties still of course in america they look upon these things in a different way how long did she speak to this alice oh a few minutes i had something else to think of you did not overhear what they said lady st simon said something about jumping a claim she was accustomed to use slang of the kind i have no idea what she meant american slang is very expressive sometimes and what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid she walked into the breakfastroom on your arm no alone she was very independent in little matters like that then after we had sat down for ten minutes or so she rose hurriedly muttered some words of apology and left the room she never came back but this maid alice as i understand deposes that she went to her room covered her brides dress with a long ulster put on a bonnet and went out quite so and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in company with flora millar a woman who is now in custody and who had already made a disturbance at mr dorans house that morning ah yes i should like a few particulars as to this young lady and your relations to her lord st simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows we have been on a friendly footing for some yearsi may say on a very friendly footing she used to be at the allegro i have not treated her ungenerously and she had no just cause of complaint against me but you know what women are mr holmes flora was a dear little thing but exceedingly hotheaded and devotedly attached to me she wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that i was about to be married and to tell the truth the reason why i had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that i feared lest there might be a scandal in the church she came to mr dorans door just after we returned and she endeavoured to push her way in uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife and even threatening her but i had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort and i had two police fellows there in private clothes who soon pushed her out again she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row did your wife hear all this no thank goodness she did not and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards yes that is what mr lestrade of scotland yard looks upon as so serious it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her well it is a possible supposition you think so too i did not say a probable one but you do not yourself look upon this as likely i do not think flora would hurt a fly still jealousy is a strange transformer of characters pray what is your own theory as to what took place well really i came to seek a theory not to propound one i have given you all the facts since you ask me however i may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife in short that she had become suddenly deranged well really when i consider that she has turned her backi will not say upon me but upon so much that many have aspired to without successi can hardly explain it in any other fashion well certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis said holmes smiling and now lord st simon i think that i have nearly all my data may i ask whether you were seated at the breakfasttable so that you could see out of the window we could see the other side of the road and the park quite so then i do not think that i need to detain you longer i shall communicate with you should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem said our client rising i have solved it eh what was that i say that i have solved it where then is my wife that is a detail which i shall speedily supply lord st simon shook his head i am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine he remarked and bowing in a stately oldfashioned manner he departed it is very good of lord st simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own said sherlock holmes laughing i think that i shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this crossquestioning i had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room my dear holmes i have notes of several similar cases though none as i remarked before which were quite as prompt my whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing as when you find a trout in the milk to quote thoreaus example but i have heard all that you have heard without however the knowledge of preexisting cases which serves me so well there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some years back and something on very much the same lines at munich the year after the francoprussian war it is one of these casesbut hullo here is lestrade goodafternoon lestrade you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard and there are cigars in the box the official detective was attired in a peajacket and cravat which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand with a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him whats up then asked holmes with a twinkle in his eye you look dissatisfied and i feel dissatisfied it is this infernal st simon marriage case i can make neither head nor tail of the business really you surprise me who ever heard of such a mixed affair every clue seems to slip through my fingers i have been at work upon it all day and very wet it seems to have made you said holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the peajacket yes i have been dragging the serpentine in heavens name what for in search of the body of lady st simon sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily have you dragged the basin of trafalgar square fountain he asked why what do you mean because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion i suppose you know all about it he snarled well i have only just heard the facts but my mind is made up oh indeed then you think that the serpentine plays no part in the matter i think it very unlikely then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it he opened his bag as he spoke and tumbled onto the floor a weddingdress of watered silk a pair of white satin shoes and a brides wreath and veil all discoloured and soaked in water there said he putting a new weddingring upon the top of the pile there is a little nut for you to crack master holmes oh indeed said my friend blowing blue rings into the air you dragged them from the serpentine no they were found floating near the margin by a parkkeeper they have been identified as her clothes and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off by the same brilliant reasoning every mans body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe and pray what did you hope to arrive at through this at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance i am afraid that you will find it difficult are you indeed now cried lestrade with some bitterness i am afraid holmes that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences you have made two blunders in as many minutes this dress does implicate miss flora millar and how in the dress is a pocket in the pocket is a cardcase in the cardcase is a note and here is the very note he slapped it down upon the table in front of him listen to this you will see me when all is ready come at once f h m now my theory all along has been that lady st simon was decoyed away by flora millar and that she with confederates no doubt was responsible for her disappearance here signed with her initials is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach very good lestrade said holmes laughing you really are very fine indeed let me see it he took up the paper in a listless way but his attention instantly became riveted and he gave a little cry of satisfaction this is indeed important said he ha you find it so extremely so i congratulate you warmly lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look why he shrieked youre looking at the wrong side on the contrary this is the right side the right side youre mad here is the note written in pencil over here and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill which interests me deeply theres nothing in it i looked at it before said lestrade oct 4th rooms 8s breakfast 2s 6d cocktail 1s lunch 2s 6d glass sherry 8d i see nothing in that very likely not it is most important all the same as to the note it is important also or at least the initials are so i congratulate you again ive wasted time enough said lestrade rising i believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories goodday mr holmes and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first he gathered up the garments thrust them into the bag and made for the door just one hint to you lestrade drawled holmes before his rival vanished i will tell you the true solution of the matter lady st simon is a myth there is not and there never has been any such person lestrade looked sadly at my companion then he turned to me tapped his forehead three times shook his head solemnly and hurried away he had hardly shut the door behind him when holmes rose to put on his overcoat there is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work he remarked so i think watson that i must leave you to your papers for a little it was after five oclock when sherlock holmes left me but i had no time to be lonely for within an hour there arrived a confectioners man with a very large flat box this he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him and presently to my very great astonishment a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodginghouse mahogany there were a couple of brace of cold woodcock a pheasant a pt de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles having laid out all these luxuries my two visitors vanished away like the genii of the arabian nights with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address just before nine oclock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the room his features were gravely set but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions they have laid the supper then he said rubbing his hands you seem to expect company they have laid for five yes i fancy we may have some company dropping in said he i am surprised that lord st simon has not already arrived ha i fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs it was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features my messenger reached you then asked holmes yes and i confess that the contents startled me beyond measure have you good authority for what you say the best possible lord st simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead what will the duke say he murmured when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation it is the purest accident i cannot allow that there is any humiliation ah you look on these things from another standpoint i fail to see that anyone is to blame i can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted having no mother she had no one to advise her at such a crisis it was a slight sir a public slight said lord st simon tapping his fingers upon the table you must make allowance for this poor girl placed in so unprecedented a position i will make no allowance i am very angry indeed and i have been shamefully used i think that i heard a ring said holmes yes there are steps on the landing if i cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter lord st simon i have brought an advocate here who may be more successful he opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman lord st simon said he allow me to introduce you to mr and mrs francis hay moulton the lady i think you have already met at the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frockcoat a picture of offended dignity the lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him but he still refused to raise his eyes it was as well for his resolution perhaps for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist youre angry robert said she well i guess you have every cause to be pray make no apology to me said lord st simon bitterly oh yes i know that i have treated you real bad and that i should have spoken to you before i went but i was kind of rattled and from the time when i saw frank here again i just didnt know what i was doing or saying i only wonder i didnt fall down and do a faint right there before the altar perhaps mrs moulton you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter if i may give an opinion remarked the strange gentleman weve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already for my part i should like all europe and america to hear the rights of it he was a small wiry sunburnt man cleanshaven with a sharp face and alert manner then ill tell our story right away said the lady frank here and i met in 84 in mcquires camp near the rockies where pa was working a claim we were engaged to each other frank and i but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile while poor frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing the richer pa grew the poorer was frank so at last pa wouldnt hear of our engagement lasting any longer and he took me away to frisco frank wouldnt throw up his hand though so he followed me there and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it it would only have made him mad to know so we just fixed it all up for ourselves frank said that he would go and make his pile too and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa so then i promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived why shouldnt we be married right away then said he and then i will feel sure of you and i wont claim to be your husband until i come back well we talked it over and he had fixed it all up so nicely with a clergyman all ready in waiting that we just did it right there and then frank went off to seek his fortune and i went back to pa the next i heard of frank was that he was in montana and then he went prospecting in arizona and then i heard of him from new mexico after that came a long newspaper story about how a miners camp had been attacked by apache indians and there was my franks name among the killed i fainted dead away and i was very sick for months after pa thought i had a decline and took me to half the doctors in frisco not a word of news came for a year and more so that i never doubted that frank was really dead then lord st simon came to frisco and we came to london and a marriage was arranged and pa was very pleased but i felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor frank still if i had married lord st simon of course id have done my duty by him we cant command our love but we can our actions i went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be but you may imagine what i felt when just as i came to the altar rails i glanced back and saw frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew i thought it was his ghost at first but when i looked again there he was still with a kind of question in his eyes as if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to see him i wonder i didnt drop i know that everything was turning round and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear i didnt know what to do should i stop the service and make a scene in the church i glanced at him again and he seemed to know what i was thinking for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still then i saw him scribble on a piece of paper and i knew that he was writing me a note as i passed his pew on the way out i dropped my bouquet over to him and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers it was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so of course i never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him and i determined to do just whatever he might direct when i got back i told my maid who had known him in california and had always been his friend i ordered her to say nothing but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready i know i ought to have spoken to lord st simon but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people i just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards i hadnt been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road he beckoned to me and then began walking into the park i slipped out put on my things and followed him some woman came talking something or other about lord st simon to meseemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage alsobut i managed to get away from her and soon overtook frank we got into a cab together and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting frank had been a prisoner among the apaches had escaped came on to frisco found that i had given him up for dead and had gone to england followed me there and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding i saw it in a paper explained the american it gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived then we had a talk as to what we should do and frank was all for openness but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should like to vanish away and never see any of them againjust sending a line to pa perhaps to show him that i was alive it was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfasttable and waiting for me to come back so frank took my weddingclothes and things and made a bundle of them so that i should not be traced and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them it is likely that we should have gone on to paris tomorrow only that this good gentleman mr holmes came round to us this evening though how he found us is more than i can think and he showed us very clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord st simon alone and so we came right away round to his rooms at once now robert you have heard it all and i am very sorry if i have given you pain and i hope that you do not think very meanly of me lord st simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative excuse me he said but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner then you wont forgive me you wont shake hands before i go oh certainly if it would give you any pleasure he put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him i had hoped suggested holmes that you would have joined us in a friendly supper i think that there you ask a little too much responded his lordship i may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments but i can hardly be expected to make merry over them i think that with your permission i will now wish you all a very goodnight he included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room then i trust that you at least will honour me with your company said sherlock holmes it is always a joy to meet an american mr moulton for i am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in fargone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same worldwide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the union jack with the stars and stripes the case has been an interesting one remarked holmes when our visitors had left us because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady and nothing stranger than the result when viewed for instance by mr lestrade of scotland yard you were not yourself at fault at all then from the first two facts were very obvious to me the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home obviously something had occurred during the morning then to cause her to change her mind what could that something be she could not have spoken to anyone when she was out for she had been in the company of the bridegroom had she seen someone then if she had it must be someone from america because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely you see we have already arrived by a process of exclusion at the idea that she might have seen an american then who could this american be and why should he possess so much influence over her it might be a lover it might be a husband her young womanhood had i knew been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions so far i had got before i ever heard lord st simons narrative when he told us of a man in a pew of the change in the brides manner of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet of her resort to her confidential maid and of her very significant allusion to claimjumpingwhich in miners parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim tothe whole situation became absolutely clear she had gone off with a man and the man was either a lover or was a previous husbandthe chances being in favour of the latter and how in the world did you find them it might have been difficult but friend lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know the initials were of course of the highest importance but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels how did you deduce the select by the select prices eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels there are not many in london which charge at that rate in the second one which i visited in northumberland avenue i learned by an inspection of the book that francis h moulton an american gentleman had left only the day before and on looking over the entries against him i came upon the very items which i had seen in the duplicate bill his letters were to be forwarded to 226 gordon square so thither i travelled and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home i ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to lord st simon in particular i invited them to meet him here and as you see i made him keep the appointment but with no very good result i remarked his conduct was certainly not very gracious ah watson said holmes smiling perhaps you would not be very gracious either if after all the trouble of wooing and wedding you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune i think that we may judge lord st simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position draw your chair up and hand me my violin for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings the adventure of the beryl coronet holmes said i as i stood one morning in our bowwindow looking down the street here is a madman coming along it seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone my friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressinggown looking over my shoulder it was a bright crisp february morning and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground shimmering brightly in the wintry sun down the centre of baker street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic but at either side and on the heapedup edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell the grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped but was still dangerously slippery so that there were fewer passengers than usual indeed from the direction of the metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention he was a man of about fifty tall portly and imposing with a massive strongly marked face and a commanding figure he was dressed in a sombre yet rich style in black frockcoat shining hat neat brown gaiters and wellcut pearlgrey trousers yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features for he was running hard with occasional little springs such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs as he ran he jerked his hands up and down waggled his head and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions what on earth can be the matter with him i asked he is looking up at the numbers of the houses i believe that he is coming here said holmes rubbing his hands here yes i rather think he is coming to consult me professionally i think that i recognise the symptoms ha did i not tell you as he spoke the man puffing and blowing rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging a few moments later he was in our room still puffing still gesticulating but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity for a while he could not get his words out but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason then suddenly springing to his feet he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room sherlock holmes pushed him down into the easychair and sitting beside him patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ you have come to me to tell your story have you not said he you are fatigued with your haste pray wait until you have recovered yourself and then i shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me the man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest fighting against his emotion then he passed his handkerchief over his brow set his lips tight and turned his face towards us no doubt you think me mad said he i see that you have had some great trouble responded holmes god knows i havea trouble which is enough to unseat my reason so sudden and so terrible is it public disgrace i might have faced although i am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain private affliction also is the lot of every man but the two coming together and in so frightful a form have been enough to shake my very soul besides it is not i alone the very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair pray compose yourself sir said holmes and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you my name answered our visitor is probably familiar to your ears i am alexander holder of the banking firm of holder stevenson of threadneedle street the name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the city of london what could have happened then to bring one of the foremost citizens of london to this most pitiable pass we waited all curiosity until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story i feel that time is of value said he that is why i hastened here when the police inspector suggested that i should secure your cooperation i came to baker street by the underground and hurried from there on foot for the cabs go slowly through this snow that is why i was so out of breath for i am a man who takes very little exercise i feel better now and i will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as i can it is of course well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors one of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans where the security is unimpeachable we have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures libraries or plate yesterday morning i was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks i started when i saw the name for it was that of none other thanwell perhaps even to you i had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earthone of the highest noblest most exalted names in england i was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted when he entered to say so but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task mr holder said he i have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money the firm does so when the security is good i answered it is absolutely essential to me said he that i should have 50000 at once i could of course borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends but i much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself in my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place ones self under obligations for how long may i ask do you want this sum i asked next monday i have a large sum due to me and i shall then most certainly repay what you advance with whatever interest you think it right to charge but it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once i should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse said i were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear if on the other hand i am to do it in the name of the firm then in justice to my partner i must insist that even in your case every businesslike precaution should be taken i should much prefer to have it so said he raising up a square black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair you have doubtless heard of the beryl coronet one of the most precious public possessions of the empire said i precisely he opened the case and there imbedded in soft fleshcoloured velvet lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named there are thirtynine enormous beryls said he and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable the lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which i have asked i am prepared to leave it with you as my security i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client you doubt its value he asked not at all i only doubt the propriety of my leaving it you may set your mind at rest about that i should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that i should be able in four days to reclaim it it is a pure matter of form is the security sufficient ample you understand mr holder that i am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which i have in you founded upon all that i have heard of you i rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but above all to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because i need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss for there are no beryls in the world to match these and it would be impossible to replace them i leave it with you however with every confidence and i shall call for it in person on monday morning seeing that my client was anxious to leave i said no more but calling for my cashier i ordered him to pay over fifty 1000 notes when i was alone once more however with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me i could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me there could be no doubt that as it was a national possession a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it i already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it however it was too late to alter the matter now so i locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work when evening came i felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me bankers safes had been forced before now and why should not mine be if so how terrible would be the position in which i should find myself i determined therefore that for the next few days i would always carry the case backward and forward with me so that it might never be really out of my reach with this intention i called a cab and drove out to my house at streatham carrying the jewel with me i did not breathe freely until i had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressingroom and now a word as to my household mr holmes for i wish you to thoroughly understand the situation my groom and my page sleep out of the house and may be set aside altogether i have three maidservants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion another lucy parr the second waitingmaid has only been in my service a few months she came with an excellent character however and has always given me satisfaction she is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place that is the only drawback which we have found to her but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way so much for the servants my family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it i am a widower and have an only son arthur he has been a disappointment to me mr holmesa grievous disappointment i have no doubt that i am myself to blame people tell me that i have spoiled him very likely i have when my dear wife died i felt that he was all i had to love i could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face i have never denied him a wish perhaps it would have been better for both of us had i been sterner but i meant it for the best it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business but he was not of a business turn he was wild wayward and to speak the truth i could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money when he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club and there having charming manners he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits he learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance that he might settle his debts of honour he tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping but each time the influence of his friend sir george burnwell was enough to draw him back again and indeed i could not wonder that such a man as sir george burnwell should gain an influence over him for he has frequently brought him to my house and i have found myself that i could hardly resist the fascination of his manner he is older than arthur a man of the world to his fingertips one who had been everywhere seen everything a brilliant talker and a man of great personal beauty yet when i think of him in cold blood far away from the glamour of his presence i am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which i have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted so i think and so too thinks my little mary who has a womans quick insight into character and now there is only she to be described she is my niece but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world i adopted her and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter she is a sunbeam in my housesweet loving beautiful a wonderful manager and housekeeper yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be she is my right hand i do not know what i could do without her in only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes twice my boy has asked her to marry him for he loves her devotedly but each time she has refused him i think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she and that his marriage might have changed his whole life but now alas it is too lateforever too late now mr holmes you know the people who live under my roof and i shall continue with my miserable story when we were taking coffee in the drawingroom that night after dinner i told arthur and mary my experience and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof suppressing only the name of my client lucy parr who had brought in the coffee had i am sure left the room but i cannot swear that the door was closed mary and arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet but i thought it better not to disturb it where have you put it asked arthur in my own bureau well i hope to goodness the house wont be burgled during the night said he it is locked up i answered oh any old key will fit that bureau when i was a youngster i have opened it myself with the key of the boxroom cupboard he often had a wild way of talking so that i thought little of what he said he followed me to my room however that night with a very grave face look here dad said he with his eyes cast down can you let me have 200 no i cannot i answered sharply i have been far too generous with you in money matters you have been very kind said he but i must have this money or else i can never show my face inside the club again and a very good thing too i cried yes but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man said he i could not bear the disgrace i must raise the money in some way and if you will not let me have it then i must try other means i was very angry for this was the third demand during the month you shall not have a farthing from me i cried on which he bowed and left the room without another word when he was gone i unlocked my bureau made sure that my treasure was safe and locked it again then i started to go round the house to see that all was securea duty which i usually leave to mary but which i thought it well to perform myself that night as i came down the stairs i saw mary herself at the side window of the hall which she closed and fastened as i approached tell me dad said she looking i thought a little disturbed did you give lucy the maid leave to go out tonight certainly not she came in just now by the back door i have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone but i think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped you must speak to her in the morning or i will if you prefer it are you sure that everything is fastened quite sure dad then goodnight i kissed her and went up to my bedroom again where i was soon asleep i am endeavouring to tell you everything mr holmes which may have any bearing upon the case but i beg that you will question me upon any point which i do not make clear on the contrary your statement is singularly lucid i come to a part of my story now in which i should wish to be particularly so i am not a very heavy sleeper and the anxiety in my mind tended no doubt to make me even less so than usual about two in the morning then i was awakened by some sound in the house it had ceased ere i was wide awake but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere i lay listening with all my ears suddenly to my horror there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room i slipped out of bed all palpitating with fear and peeped round the corner of my dressingroom door arthur i screamed you villain you thief how dare you touch that coronet the gas was half up as i had left it and my unhappy boy dressed only in his shirt and trousers was standing beside the light holding the coronet in his hands he appeared to be wrenching at it or bending it with all his strength at my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death i snatched it up and examined it one of the gold corners with three of the beryls in it was missing you blackguard i shouted beside myself with rage you have destroyed it you have dishonoured me forever where are the jewels which you have stolen stolen he cried yes thief i roared shaking him by the shoulder there are none missing there cannot be any missing said he there are three missing and you know where they are must i call you a liar as well as a thief did i not see you trying to tear off another piece you have called me names enough said he i will not stand it any longer i shall not say another word about this business since you have chosen to insult me i will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world you shall leave it in the hands of the police i cried halfmad with grief and rage i shall have this matter probed to the bottom you shall learn nothing from me said he with a passion such as i should not have thought was in his nature if you choose to call the police let the police find what they can by this time the whole house was astir for i had raised my voice in my anger mary was the first to rush into my room and at the sight of the coronet and of arthurs face she read the whole story and with a scream fell down senseless on the ground i sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once when the inspector and a constable entered the house arthur who had stood sullenly with his arms folded asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft i answered that it had ceased to be a private matter but had become a public one since the ruined coronet was national property i was determined that the law should have its way in everything at least said he you will not have me arrested at once it would be to your advantage as well as mine if i might leave the house for five minutes that you may get away or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen said i and then realising the dreadful position in which i was placed i implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than i was at stake and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation he might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones you may as well face the matter said i you have been caught in the act and no confession could make your guilt more heinous if you but make such reparation as is in your power by telling us where the beryls are all shall be forgiven and forgotten keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it he answered turning away from me with a sneer i saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him there was but one way for it i called in the inspector and gave him into custody a search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems but no trace of them could be found nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats this morning he was removed to a cell and i after going through all the police formalities have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter the police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it you may go to any expense which you think necessary i have already offered a reward of 1000 my god what shall i do i have lost my honour my gems and my son in one night oh what shall i do he put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words sherlock holmes sat silent for some few minutes with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire do you receive much company he asked none save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of arthurs sir george burnwell has been several times lately no one else i think do you go out much in society arthur does mary and i stay at home we neither of us care for it that is unusual in a young girl she is of a quiet nature besides she is not so very young she is fourandtwenty this matter from what you say seems to have been a shock to her also terrible she is even more affected than i you have neither of you any doubt as to your sons guilt how can we have when i saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands i hardly consider that a conclusive proof was the remainder of the coronet at all injured yes it was twisted do you not think then that he might have been trying to straighten it god bless you you are doing what you can for him and for me but it is too heavy a task what was he doing there at all if his purpose were innocent why did he not say so precisely and if it were guilty why did he not invent a lie his silence appears to me to cut both ways there are several singular points about the case what did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep they considered that it might be caused by arthurs closing his bedroom door a likely story as if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household what did they say then of the disappearance of these gems they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them have they thought of looking outside the house yes they have shown extraordinary energy the whole garden has already been minutely examined now my dear sir said holmes is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think it appeared to you to be a simple case to me it seems exceedingly complex consider what is involved by your theory you suppose that your son came down from his bed went at great risk to your dressingroom opened your bureau took out your coronet broke off by main force a small portion of it went off to some other place concealed three gems out of the thirtynine with such skill that nobody can find them and then returned with the other thirtysix into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered i ask you now is such a theory tenable but what other is there cried the banker with a gesture of despair if his motives were innocent why does he not explain them it is our task to find that out replied holmes so now if you please mr holder we will set off for streatham together and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition which i was eager enough to do for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened i confess that the guilt of the bankers son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father but still i had such faith in holmes judgment that i felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes sunk in the deepest thought our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs a short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank the modest residence of the great financier fairbank was a goodsized square house of white stone standing back a little from the road a double carriagesweep with a snowclad lawn stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance on the right side was a small wooden thicket which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door and forming the tradesmens entrance on the left ran a lane which led to the stables and was not itself within the grounds at all being a public though little used thoroughfare holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house across the front down the tradesmens path and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane so long was he that mr holder and i went into the diningroom and waited by the fire until he should return we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in she was rather above the middle height slim with dark hair and eyes which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin i do not think that i have ever seen such deadly paleness in a womans face her lips too were bloodless but her eyes were flushed with crying as she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character with immense capacity for selfrestraint disregarding my presence she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress you have given orders that arthur should be liberated have you not dad she asked no no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom but i am so sure that he is innocent you know what womans instincts are i know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly why is he silent then if he is innocent who knows perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him how could i help suspecting him when i actually saw him with the coronet in his hand oh but he had only picked it up to look at it oh do do take my word for it that he is innocent let the matter drop and say no more it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in prison i shall never let it drop until the gems are foundnever mary your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me far from hushing the thing up i have brought a gentleman down from london to inquire more deeply into it this gentleman she asked facing round to me no his friend he wished us to leave him alone he is round in the stable lane now the stable lane she raised her dark eyebrows what can he hope to find there ah this i suppose is he i trust sir that you will succeed in proving what i feel sure is the truth that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime i fully share your opinion and i trust with you that we may prove it returned holmes going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes i believe i have the honour of addressing miss mary holder might i ask you a question or two pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible affair up you heard nothing yourself last night nothing until my uncle here began to speak loudly i heard that and i came down you shut up the windows and doors the night before did you fasten all the windows yes were they all fastened this morning yes you have a maid who has a sweetheart i think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him yes and she was the girl who waited in the drawingroom and who may have heard uncles remarks about the coronet i see you infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart and that the two may have planned the robbery but what is the good of all these vague theories cried the banker impatiently when i have told you that i saw arthur with the coronet in his hands wait a little mr holder we must come back to that about this girl miss holder you saw her return by the kitchen door i presume yes when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i met her slipping in i saw the man too in the gloom do you know him oh yes he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round his name is francis prosper he stood said holmes to the left of the doorthat is to say farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door yes he did and he is a man with a wooden leg something like fear sprang up in the young ladys expressive black eyes why you are like a magician said she how do you know that she smiled but there was no answering smile in holmes thin eager face i should be very glad now to go upstairs said he i shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again perhaps i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go up he walked swiftly round from one to the other pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane this he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens now we shall go upstairs said he at last the bankers dressingroom was a plainly furnished little chamber with a grey carpet a large bureau and a long mirror holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock which key was used to open it he asked that which my son himself indicatedthat of the cupboard of the lumberroom have you it here that is it on the dressingtable sherlock holmes took it up and opened the bureau it is a noiseless lock said he it is no wonder that it did not wake you this case i presume contains the coronet we must have a look at it he opened the case and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table it was a magnificent specimen of the jewellers art and the thirtysix stones were the finest that i have ever seen at one side of the coronet was a cracked edge where a corner holding three gems had been torn away now mr holder said holmes here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost might i beg that you will break it off the banker recoiled in horror i should not dream of trying said he then i will holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it but without result i feel it give a little said he but though i am exceptionally strong in the fingers it would take me all my time to break it an ordinary man could not do it now what do you think would happen if i did break it mr holder there would be a noise like a pistol shot do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it i do not know what to think it is all dark to me but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go what do you think miss holder i confess that i still share my uncles perplexity your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt thank you we have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up with your permission mr holder i shall now continue my investigations outside he went alone at his own request for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult for an hour or more he was at work returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever i think that i have seen now all that there is to see mr holder said he i can serve you best by returning to my rooms but the gems mr holmes where are they i cannot tell the banker wrung his hands i shall never see them again he cried and my son you give me hopes my opinion is in no way altered then for gods sake what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms tomorrow morning between nine and ten i shall be happy to do what i can to make it clearer i understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you provided only that i get back the gems and that you place no limit on the sum i may draw i would give my fortune to have them back very good i shall look into the matter between this and then goodbye it is just possible that i may have to come over here again before evening it was obvious to me that my companions mind was now made up about the case although what his conclusions were was more than i could even dimly imagine several times during our homeward journey i endeavoured to sound him upon the point but he always glided away to some other topic until at last i gave it over in despair it was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more he hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer with his collar turned up his shiny seedy coat his red cravat and his worn boots he was a perfect sample of the class i think that this should do said he glancing into the glass above the fireplace i only wish that you could come with me watson but i fear that it wont do i may be on the trail in this matter or i may be following a willothewisp but i shall soon know which it is i hope that i may be back in a few hours he cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard sandwiched it between two rounds of bread and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition i had just finished my tea when he returned evidently in excellent spirits swinging an old elasticsided boot in his hand he chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea i only looked in as i passed said he i am going right on where to oh to the other side of the west end it may be some time before i get back dont wait up for me in case i should be late how are you getting on oh so so nothing to complain of i have been out to streatham since i saw you last but i did not call at the house it is a very sweet little problem and i would not have missed it for a good deal however i must not sit gossiping here but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self i could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply his eyes twinkled and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks he hastened upstairs and a few minutes later i heard the slam of the hall door which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt i waited until midnight but there was no sign of his return so i retired to my room it was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent so that his lateness caused me no surprise i do not know at what hour he came in but when i came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other as fresh and trim as possible you will excuse my beginning without you watson said he but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning why it is after nine now i answered i should not be surprised if that were he i thought i heard a ring it was indeed our friend the financier i was shocked by the change which had come over him for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould was now pinched and fallen in while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter he entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before and he dropped heavily into the armchair which i pushed forward for him i do not know what i have done to be so severely tried said he only two days ago i was a happy and prosperous man without a care in the world now i am left to a lonely and dishonoured age one sorrow comes close upon the heels of another my niece mary has deserted me deserted you yes her bed this morning had not been slept in her room was empty and a note for me lay upon the hall table i had said to her last night in sorrow and not in anger that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so it is to that remark that she refers in this note my dearest uncle i feel that i have brought trouble upon you and that if i had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred i cannot with this thought in my mind ever again be happy under your roof and i feel that i must leave you forever do not worry about my future for that is provided for and above all do not search for me for it will be fruitless labour and an illservice to me in life or in death i am ever your loving mary what could she mean by that note mr holmes do you think it points to suicide no no nothing of the kind it is perhaps the best possible solution i trust mr holder that you are nearing the end of your troubles ha you say so you have heard something mr holmes you have learned something where are the gems you would not think 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them i would pay ten that would be unnecessary three thousand will cover the matter and there is a little reward i fancy have you your checkbook here is a pen better make it out for 4000 with a dazed face the banker made out the required check holmes walked over to his desk took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it and threw it down upon the table with a shriek of joy our client clutched it up you have it he gasped i am saved i am saved the reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom there is one other thing you owe mr holder said sherlock holmes rather sternly owe he caught up a pen name the sum and i will pay it no the debt is not to me you owe a very humble apology to that noble lad your son who has carried himself in this matter as i should be proud to see my own son do should i ever chance to have one then it was not arthur who took them i told you yesterday and i repeat today that it was not you are sure of it then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known he knows it already when i had cleared it all up i had an interview with him and finding that he would not tell me the story i told it to him on which he had to confess that i was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me your news of this morning however may open his lips for heavens sake tell me then what is this extraordinary mystery i will do so and i will show you the steps by which i reached it and let me say to you first that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear there has been an understanding between sir george burnwell and your niece mary they have now fled together my mary impossible it is unfortunately more than possible it is certain neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle he is one of the most dangerous men in englanda ruined gambler an absolutely desperate villain a man without heart or conscience your niece knew nothing of such men when he breathed his vows to her as he had done to a hundred before her she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart the devil knows best what he said but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening i cannot and i will not believe it cried the banker with an ashen face i will tell you then what occurred in your house last night your niece when you had as she thought gone to your room slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane his footmarks had pressed right through the snow so long had he stood there she told him of the coronet his wicked lust for gold kindled at the news and he bent her to his will i have no doubt that she loved you but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves and i think that she must have been one she had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants escapade with her woodenlegged lover which was all perfectly true your boy arthur went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts in the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door so he rose and looking out was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressingroom petrified with astonishment the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair presently she emerged from the room again and in the light of the passagelamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands she passed down the stairs and he thrilling with horror ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath he saw her stealthily open the window hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom and then closing it once more hurry back to her room passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved but the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you and how allimportant it was to set it right he rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight sir george burnwell tried to get away but arthur caught him and there was a struggle between them your lad tugging at one side of the coronet and his opponent at the other in the scuffle your son struck sir george and cut him over the eye then something suddenly snapped and your son finding that he had the coronet in his hands rushed back closed the window ascended to your room and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene is it possible gasped the banker you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks he could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands he took the more chivalrous view however and preserved her secret and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet cried mr holder oh my god what a blind fool i have been and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle how cruelly i have misjudged him when i arrived at the house continued holmes i at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me i knew that none had fallen since the evening before and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions i passed along the tradesmens path but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable just beyond it however at the far side of the kitchen door a woman had stood and talked with a man whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg i could even tell that they had been disturbed for the woman had run back swiftly to the door as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks while woodenleg had waited a little and then had gone away i thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart of whom you had already spoken to me and inquiry showed it was so i passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks which i took to be the police but when i got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me there was a double line of tracks of a booted man and a second double line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet i was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son the first had walked both ways but the other had run swiftly and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot it was obvious that he had passed after the other i followed them up and found they led to the hall window where boots had worn all the snow away while waiting then i walked to the other end which was a hundred yards or more down the lane i saw where boots had faced round where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle and finally where a few drops of blood had fallen to show me that i was not mistaken boots had then run down the lane and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt when he came to the highroad at the other end i found that the pavement had been cleared so there was an end to that clue on entering the house however i examined as you remember the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens and i could at once see that someone had passed out i could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in i was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred a man had waited outside the window someone had brought the gems the deed had been overseen by your son he had pursued the thief had struggled with him they had each tugged at the coronet their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected he had returned with the prize but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent so far i was clear the question now was who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth now i knew that it was not you who had brought it down so there only remained your niece and the maids but if it were the maids why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place there could be no possible reason as he loved his cousin however there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secretthe more so as the secret was a disgraceful one when i remembered that you had seen her at that window and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again my conjecture became a certainty and who could it be who was her confederate a lover evidently for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you i knew that you went out little and that your circle of friends was a very limited one but among them was sir george burnwell i had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women it must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems even though he knew that arthur had discovered him he might still flatter himself that he was safe for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family well your own good sense will suggest what measures i took next i went in the shape of a loafer to sir georges house managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet learned that his master had cut his head the night before and finally at the expense of six shillings made all sure by buying a pair of his castoff shoes with these i journeyed down to streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks i saw an illdressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening said mr holder precisely it was i i found that i had my man so i came home and changed my clothes it was a delicate part which i had to play then for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter i went and saw him at first of course he denied everything but when i gave him every particular that had occurred he tried to bluster and took down a lifepreserver from the wall i knew my man however and i clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike then he became a little more reasonable i told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held1000 apiece that brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown why dash it all said he ive let them go at six hundred for the three i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them on promising him that there would be no prosecution off i set to him and after much chaffering i got our stones at 1000 apiece then i looked in upon your son told him that all was right and eventually got to my bed about two oclock after what i may call a really hard days work a day which has saved england from a great public scandal said the banker rising sir i cannot find words to thank you but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done your skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it and now i must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which i have done him as to what you tell me of poor mary it goes to my very heart not even your skill can inform me where she is now i think that we may safely say returned holmes that she is wherever sir george burnwell is it is equally certain too that whatever her sins are they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment the adventure of the copper beeches to the man who loves art for its own sake remarked sherlock holmes tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the daily telegraph it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived it is pleasant to me to observe watson that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up and i am bound to say occasionally to embellish you have given prominence not so much to the many causes clbres and sensational trials in which i have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made my special province and yet said i smiling i cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records you have erred perhaps he observed taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherrywood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative moodyou have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing it seems to me that i have done you full justice in the matter i remarked with some coldness for i was repelled by the egotism which i had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friends singular character no it is not selfishness or conceit said he answering as was his wont my thoughts rather than my words if i claim full justice for my art it is because it is an impersonal thinga thing beyond myself crime is common logic is rare therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell you have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales it was a cold morning of the early spring and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at baker street a thick fog rolled down between the lines of duncoloured houses and the opposing windows loomed like dark shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal for the table had not been cleared yet sherlock holmes had been silent all the morning dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last having apparently given up his search he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings at the same time he remarked after a pause during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in a fair proportion do not treat of crime in its legal sense at all the small matter in which i endeavoured to help the king of bohemia the singular experience of miss mary sutherland the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip and the incident of the noble bachelor were all matters which are outside the pale of the law but in avoiding the sensational i fear that you may have bordered on the trivial the end may have been so i answered but the methods i hold to have been novel and of interest pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the great unobservant public who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction but indeed if you are trivial i cannot blame you for the days of the great cases are past man or at least criminal man has lost all enterprise and originality as to my own little practice it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boardingschools i think that i have touched bottom at last however this note i had this morning marks my zeropoint i fancy read it he tossed a crumpled letter across to me it was dated from montague place upon the preceding evening and ran thus dear mr holmes i am very anxious to consult you as to whether i should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess i shall call at halfpast ten tomorrow if i do not inconvenience you yours faithfully violet hunter do you know the young lady i asked not i it is halfpast ten now yes and i have no doubt that is her ring it may turn out to be of more interest than you think you remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle which appeared to be a mere whim at first developed into a serious investigation it may be so in this case also well let us hope so but our doubts will very soon be solved for here unless i am much mistaken is the person in question as he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room she was plainly but neatly dressed with a bright quick face freckled like a plovers egg and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world you will excuse my troubling you i am sure said she as my companion rose to greet her but i have had a very strange experience and as i have no parents or relations of any sort from whom i could ask advice i thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what i should do pray take a seat miss hunter i shall be happy to do anything that i can to serve you i could see that holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client he looked her over in his searching fashion and then composed himself with his lids drooping and his fingertips together to listen to her story i have been a governess for five years said she in the family of colonel spence munro but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at halifax in nova scotia and took his children over to america with him so that i found myself without a situation i advertised and i answered advertisements but without success at last the little money which i had saved began to run short and i was at my wits end as to what i should do there is a wellknown agency for governesses in the west end called westaways and there i used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me westaway was the name of the founder of the business but it is really managed by miss stoper she sits in her own little office and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom and are then shown in one by one when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them well when i called last week i was shown into the little office as usual but i found that miss stoper was not alone a prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered as i came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to miss stoper that will do said he i could not ask for anything better capital capital he seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion he was such a comfortablelooking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him you are looking for a situation miss he asked yes sir as governess yes sir and what salary do you ask i had 4 a month in my last place with colonel spence munro oh tut tut sweatingrank sweating he cried throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion how could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments my accomplishments sir may be less than you imagine said i a little french a little german music and drawing tut tut he cried this is all quite beside the question the point is have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady there it is in a nutshell if you have not you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country but if you have why then how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures your salary with me madam would commence at 100 a year you may imagine mr holmes that to me destitute as i was such an offer seemed almost too good to be true the gentleman however seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face opened a pocketbook and took out a note it is also my custom said he smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe it seemed to me that i had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man as i was already in debt to my tradesmen the advance was a great convenience and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before i quite committed myself may i ask where you live sir said i hampshire charming rural place the copper beeches five miles on the far side of winchester it is the most lovely country my dear young lady and the dearest old countryhouse and my duties sir i should be glad to know what they would be one childone dear little romper just six years old oh if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper smack smack smack three gone before you could wink he leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again i was a little startled at the nature of the childs amusement but the fathers laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking my sole duties then i asked are to take charge of a single child no no not the sole not the sole my dear young lady he cried your duty would be as i am sure your good sense would suggest to obey any little commands my wife might give provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey you see no difficulty heh i should be happy to make myself useful quite so in dress now for example we are faddy people you knowfaddy but kindhearted if you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you you would not object to our little whim heh no said i considerably astonished at his words or to sit here or sit there that would not be offensive to you oh no or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us i could hardly believe my ears as you may observe mr holmes my hair is somewhat luxuriant and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut it has been considered artistic i could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion i am afraid that that is quite impossible said i he had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes and i could see a shadow pass over his face as i spoke i am afraid that it is quite essential said he it is a little fancy of my wifes and ladies fancies you know madam ladies fancies must be consulted and so you wont cut your hair no sir i really could not i answered firmly ah very well then that quite settles the matter it is a pity because in other respects you would really have done very nicely in that case miss stoper i had best inspect a few more of your young ladies the manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that i could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal do you desire your name to be kept upon the books she asked if you please miss stoper well really it seems rather useless since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion said she sharply you can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you goodday to you miss hunter she struck a gong upon the table and i was shown out by the page well mr holmes when i got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard and two or three bills upon the table i began to ask myself whether i had not done a very foolish thing after all if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity very few governesses in england are getting 100 a year besides what use was my hair to me many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps i should be among the number next day i was inclined to think that i had made a mistake and by the day after i was sure of it i had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when i received this letter from the gentleman himself i have it here and i will read it to you the copper beeches near winchester dear miss hunter miss stoper has very kindly given me your address and i write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision my wife is very anxious that you should come for she has been much attracted by my description of you we are willing to give 30 a quarter or 120 a year so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you they are not very exacting after all my wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning you need not however go to the expense of purchasing one as we have one belonging to my dear daughter alice now in philadelphia which would i should think fit you very well then as to sitting here or there or amusing yourself in any manner indicated that need cause you no inconvenience as regards your hair it is no doubt a pity especially as i could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview but i am afraid that i must remain firm upon this point and i only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss your duties as far as the child is concerned are very light now do try to come and i shall meet you with the dogcart at winchester let me know your train yours faithfully jephro rucastle that is the letter which i have just received mr holmes and my mind is made up that i will accept it i thought however that before taking the final step i should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration well miss hunter if your mind is made up that settles the question said holmes smiling but you would not advise me to refuse i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to see a sister of mine apply for what is the meaning of it all mr holmes ah i have no data i cannot tell perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion well there seems to me to be only one possible solution mr rucastle seemed to be a very kind goodnatured man is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak that is a possible solutionin fact as matters stand it is the most probable one but in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady but the money mr holmes the money well yes of course the pay is goodtoo good that is what makes me uneasy why should they give you 120 a year when they could have their pick for 40 there must be some strong reason behind i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if i wanted your help i should feel so much stronger if i felt that you were at the back of me oh you may carry that feeling away with you i assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months there is something distinctly novel about some of the features if you should find yourself in doubt or in danger danger what danger do you foresee holmes shook his head gravely it would cease to be a danger if we could define it said he but at any time day or night a telegram would bring me down to your help that is enough she rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face i shall go down to hampshire quite easy in my mind now i shall write to mr rucastle at once sacrifice my poor hair tonight and start for winchester tomorrow with a few grateful words to holmes she bade us both goodnight and bustled off upon her way at least said i as we heard her quick firm steps descending the stairs she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself and she would need to be said holmes gravely i am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past it was not very long before my friends prediction was fulfilled a fortnight went by during which i frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange sidealley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into the unusual salary the curious conditions the light duties all pointed to something abnormal though whether a fad or a plot or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain it was quite beyond my powers to determine as to holmes i observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end with knitted brows and an abstracted air but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when i mentioned it data data data he cried impatiently i cant make bricks without clay and yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation the telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as i was thinking of turning in and holmes was settling down to one of those allnight chemical researches which he frequently indulged in when i would leave him stooping over a retort and a testtube at night and find him in the same position when i came down to breakfast in the morning he opened the yellow envelope and then glancing at the message threw it across to me just look up the trains in bradshaw said he and turned back to his chemical studies the summons was a brief and urgent one please be at the black swan hotel at winchester at midday tomorrow it said do come i am at my wits end hunter will you come with me asked holmes glancing up i should wish to just look it up then there is a train at halfpast nine said i glancing over my bradshaw it is due at winchester at 1130 that will do very nicely then perhaps i had better postpone my analysis of the acetones as we may need to be at our best in the morning by eleven oclock the next day we were well upon our way to the old english capital holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down but after we had passed the hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery it was an ideal spring day a light blue sky flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east the sun was shining very brightly and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air which set an edge to a mans energy all over the countryside away to the rolling hills around aldershot the little red and grey roofs of the farmsteadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage are they not fresh and beautiful i cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of baker street but holmes shook his head gravely do you know watson said he that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that i must look at everything with reference to my own special subject you look at these scattered houses and you are impressed by their beauty i look at them and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there good heavens i cried who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads they always fill me with a certain horror it is my belief watson founded upon my experience that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside you horrify me but the reason is very obvious the pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish there is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child or the thud of a drunkards blow does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going and there is but a step between the crime and the dock but look at these lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law think of the deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on year in year out in such places and none the wiser had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester i should never have had a fear for her it is the five miles of country which makes the danger still it is clear that she is not personally threatened no if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away quite so she has her freedom what can be the matter then can you suggest no explanation i have devised seven separate explanations each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us well there is the tower of the cathedral and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell the black swan is an inn of repute in the high street at no distance from the station and there we found the young lady waiting for us she had engaged a sittingroom and our lunch awaited us upon the table i am so delighted that you have come she said earnestly it is so very kind of you both but indeed i do not know what i should do your advice will be altogether invaluable to me pray tell us what has happened to you i will do so and i must be quick for i have promised mr rucastle to be back before three i got his leave to come into town this morning though he little knew for what purpose let us have everything in its due order holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen in the first place i may say that i have met on the whole with no actual illtreatment from mr and mrs rucastle it is only fair to them to say that but i cannot understand them and i am not easy in my mind about them what can you not understand their reasons for their conduct but you shall have it all just as it occurred when i came down mr rucastle met me here and drove me in his dogcart to the copper beeches it is as he said beautifully situated but it is not beautiful in itself for it is a large square block of a house whitewashed but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather there are grounds round it woods on three sides and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the southampton highroad which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door this ground in front belongs to the house but the woods all round are part of lord southertons preserves a clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place i was driven over by my employer who was as amiable as ever and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child there was no truth mr holmes in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at baker street mrs rucastle is not mad i found her to be a silent palefaced woman much younger than her husband not more than thirty i should think while he can hardly be less than fortyfive from their conversation i have gathered that they have been married about seven years that he was a widower and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia mr rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother as the daughter could not have been less than twenty i can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her fathers young wife mrs rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse she was a nonentity it was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other noting every little want and forestalling it if possible he was kind to her also in his bluff boisterous fashion and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple and yet she had some secret sorrow this woman she would often be lost in deep thought with the saddest look upon her face more than once i have surprised her in tears i have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind for i have never met so utterly spoiled and so illnatured a little creature he is small for his age with a head which is quite disproportionately large his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice little birds and insects but i would rather not talk about the creature mr holmes and indeed he has little to do with my story i am glad of all details remarked my friend whether they seem to you to be relevant or not i shall try not to miss anything of importance the one unpleasant thing about the house which struck me at once was the appearance and conduct of the servants there are only two a man and his wife toller for that is his name is a rough uncouth man with grizzled hair and whiskers and a perpetual smell of drink twice since i have been with them he has been quite drunk and yet mr rucastle seemed to take no notice of it his wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face as silent as mrs rucastle and much less amiable they are a most unpleasant couple but fortunately i spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room which are next to each other in one corner of the building for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was very quiet on the third mrs rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband oh yes said he turning to me we are very much obliged to you miss hunter for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair i assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance we shall now see how the electricblue dress will become you you will find it laid out upon the bed in your room and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged the dress which i found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue it was of excellent material a sort of beige but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before it could not have been a better fit if i had been measured for it both mr and mrs rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence they were waiting for me in the drawingroom which is a very large room stretching along the entire front of the house with three long windows reaching down to the floor a chair had been placed close to the central window with its back turned towards it in this i was asked to sit and then mr rucastle walking up and down on the other side of the room began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that i have ever listened to you cannot imagine how comical he was and i laughed until i was quite weary mrs rucastle however who has evidently no sense of humour never so much as smiled but sat with her hands in her lap and a sad anxious look upon her face after an hour or so mr rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day and that i might change my dress and go to little edward in the nursery two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances again i changed my dress again i sat in the window and again i laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense rpertoire and which he told inimitably then he handed me a yellowbacked novel and moving my chair a little sideways that my own shadow might not fall upon the page he begged me to read aloud to him i read for about ten minutes beginning in the heart of a chapter and then suddenly in the middle of a sentence he ordered me to cease and to change my dress you can easily imagine mr holmes how curious i became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be they were always very careful i observed to turn my face away from the window so that i became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back at first it seemed to be impossible but i soon devised a means my handmirror had been broken so a happy thought seized me and i concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief on the next occasion in the midst of my laughter i put my handkerchief up to my eyes and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me i confess that i was disappointed there was nothing at least that was my first impression at the second glance however i perceived that there was a man standing in the southampton road a small bearded man in a grey suit who seemed to be looking in my direction the road is an important highway and there are usually people there this man however was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up i lowered my handkerchief and glanced at mrs rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze she said nothing but i am convinced that she had divined that i had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me she rose at once jephro said she there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at miss hunter no friend of yours miss hunter he asked no i know no one in these parts dear me how very impertinent kindly turn round and motion to him to go away surely it would be better to take no notice no no we should have him loitering here always kindly turn round and wave him away like that i did as i was told and at the same instant mrs rucastle drew down the blind that was a week ago and from that time i have not sat again in the window nor have i worn the blue dress nor seen the man in the road pray continue said holmes your narrative promises to be a most interesting one you will find it rather disconnected i fear and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which i speak on the very first day that i was at the copper beeches mr rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door as we approached it i heard the sharp rattling of a chain and the sound as of a large animal moving about look in here said mr rucastle showing me a slit between two planks is he not a beauty i looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness dont be frightened said my employer laughing at the start which i had given its only carlo my mastiff i call him mine but really old toller my groom is the only man who can do anything with him we feed him once a day and not too much then so that he is always as keen as mustard toller lets him loose every night and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon for goodness sake dont you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night for its as much as your life is worth the warning was no idle one for two nights later i happened to look out of my bedroom window about two oclock in the morning it was a beautiful moonlight night and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day i was standing rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene when i was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches as it emerged into the moonshine i saw what it was it was a giant dog as large as a calf tawny tinted with hanging jowl black muzzle and huge projecting bones it walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side that dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which i do not think that any burglar could have done and now i have a very strange experience to tell you i had as you know cut off my hair in london and i had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk one evening after the child was in bed i began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things there was an old chest of drawers in the room the two upper ones empty and open the lower one locked i had filled the first two with my linen and as i had still much to pack away i was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer it struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight so i took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it the very first key fitted to perfection and i drew the drawer open there was only one thing in it but i am sure that you would never guess what it was it was my coil of hair i took it up and examined it it was of the same peculiar tint and the same thickness but then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me how could my hair have been locked in the drawer with trembling hands i undid my trunk turned out the contents and drew from the bottom my own hair i laid the two tresses together and i assure you that they were identical was it not extraordinary puzzle as i would i could make nothing at all of what it meant i returned the strange hair to the drawer and i said nothing of the matter to the rucastles as i felt that i had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked i am naturally observant as you may have remarked mr holmes and i soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head there was one wing however which appeared not to be inhabited at all a door which faced that which led into the quarters of the tollers opened into this suite but it was invariably locked one day however as i ascended the stair i met mr rucastle coming out through this door his keys in his hand and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round jovial man to whom i was accustomed his cheeks were red his brow was all crinkled with anger and the veins stood out at his temples with passion he locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look this aroused my curiosity so when i went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge i strolled round to the side from which i could see the windows of this part of the house there were four of them in a row three of which were simply dirty while the fourth was shuttered up they were evidently all deserted as i strolled up and down glancing at them occasionally mr rucastle came out to me looking as merry and jovial as ever ah said he you must not think me rude if i passed you without a word my dear young lady i was preoccupied with business matters i assured him that i was not offended by the way said i you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there and one of them has the shutters up he looked surprised and as it seemed to me a little startled at my remark photography is one of my hobbies said he i have made my dark room up there but dear me what an observant young lady we have come upon who would have believed it who would have ever believed it he spoke in a jesting tone but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me i read suspicion there and annoyance but no jest well mr holmes from the moment that i understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which i was not to know i was all on fire to go over them it was not mere curiosity though i have my share of that it was more a feeling of dutya feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place they talk of womans instinct perhaps it was womans instinct which gave me that feeling at any rate it was there and i was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door it was only yesterday that the chance came i may tell you that besides mr rucastle both toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms and i once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door recently he has been drinking hard and yesterday evening he was very drunk and when i came upstairs there was the key in the door i have no doubt at all that he had left it there mr and mrs rucastle were both downstairs and the child was with them so that i had an admirable opportunity i turned the key gently in the lock opened the door and slipped through there was a little passage in front of me unpapered and uncarpeted which turned at a right angle at the farther end round this corner were three doors in a line the first and third of which were open they each led into an empty room dusty and cheerless with two windows in the one and one in the other so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them the centre door was closed and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall and fastened at the other with stout cord the door itself was locked as well and the key was not there this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside and yet i could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above as i stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil i suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door a mad unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight mr holmes my overstrung nerves failed me suddenly and i turned and ranran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress i rushed down the passage through the door and straight into the arms of mr rucastle who was waiting outside so said he smiling it was you then i thought that it must be when i saw the door open oh i am so frightened i panted my dear young lady my dear young ladyyou cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner wasand what has frightened you my dear young lady but his voice was just a little too coaxing he overdid it i was keenly on my guard against him i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing i answered but it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that i was frightened and ran out again oh it is so dreadfully still in there only that said he looking at me keenly why what did you think i asked why do you think that i lock this door i am sure that i do not know it is to keep people out who have no business there do you see he was still smiling in the most amiable manner i am sure if i had known well then you know now and if you ever put your foot over that threshold againhere in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage and he glared down at me with the face of a demonill throw you to the mastiff i was so terrified that i do not know what i did i suppose that i must have rushed past him into my room i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over then i thought of you mr holmes i could not live there longer without some advice i was frightened of the house of the man of the woman of the servants even of the child they were all horrible to me if i could only bring you down all would be well of course i might have fled from the house but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears my mind was soon made up i would send you a wire i put on my hat and cloak went down to the office which is about half a mile from the house and then returned feeling very much easier a horrible doubt came into my mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose but i remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature or who would venture to set him free i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you i had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this morning but i must be back before three oclock for mr and mrs rucastle are going on a visit and will be away all the evening so that i must look after the child now i have told you all my adventures mr holmes and i should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means and above all what i should do holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story my friend rose now and paced up and down the room his hands in his pockets and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face is toller still drunk he asked yes i heard his wife tell mrs rucastle that she could do nothing with him that is well and the rucastles go out tonight yes is there a cellar with a good strong lock yes the winecellar you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl miss hunter do you think that you could perform one more feat i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite exceptional woman i will try what is it we shall be at the copper beeches by seven oclock my friend and i the rucastles will be gone by that time and toller will we hope be incapable there only remains mrs toller who might give the alarm if you could send her into the cellar on some errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate matters immensely i will do it excellent we shall then look thoroughly into the affair of course there is only one feasible explanation you have been brought there to personate someone and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber that is obvious as to who this prisoner is i have no doubt that it is the daughter miss alice rucastle if i remember right who was said to have gone to america you were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height figure and the colour of your hair hers had been cut off very possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of course yours had to be sacrificed also by a curious chance you came upon her tresses the man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of herspossibly her fiancand no doubt as you wore the girls dress and were so like her he was convinced from your laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from your gesture that miss rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer desired his attentions the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her so much is fairly clear the most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child what on earth has that to do with it i ejaculated my dear watson you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents dont you see that the converse is equally valid i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children this childs disposition is abnormally cruel merely for crueltys sake and whether he derives this from his smiling father as i should suspect or from his mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power i am sure that you are right mr holmes cried our client a thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it oh let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature we must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning man we can do nothing until seven oclock at that hour we shall be with you and it will not be long before we solve the mystery we were as good as our word for it was just seven when we reached the copper beeches having put up our trap at a wayside publichouse the group of trees with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun were sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been standing smiling on the doorstep have you managed it asked holmes a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs that is mrs toller in the cellar said she her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug here are his keys which are the duplicates of mr rucastles you have done well indeed cried holmes with enthusiasm now lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black business we passed up the stair unlocked the door followed on down a passage and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar then he tried the various keys in the lock but without success no sound came from within and at the silence holmes face clouded over i trust that we are not too late said he i think miss hunter that we had better go in without you now watson put your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength together we rushed into the room it was empty there was no furniture save a little pallet bed a small table and a basketful of linen the skylight above was open and the prisoner gone there has been some villainy here said holmes this beauty has guessed miss hunters intentions and has carried his victim off but how through the skylight we shall soon see how he managed it he swung himself up onto the roof ah yes he cried heres the end of a long light ladder against the eaves that is how he did it but it is impossible said miss hunter the ladder was not there when the rucastles went away he has come back and done it i tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man i should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair i think watson that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room a very fat and burly man with a heavy stick in his hand miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him you villain said he wheres your daughter the fat man cast his eyes round and then up at the open skylight it is for me to ask you that he shrieked you thieves spies and thieves i have caught you have i you are in my power ill serve you he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go hes gone for the dog cried miss hunter i have my revolver said i better close the front door cried holmes and we all rushed down the stairs together we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound and then a scream of agony with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door my god he cried someone has loosed the dog its not been fed for two days quick quick or itll be too late holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house with toller hurrying behind us there was the huge famished brute its black muzzle buried in rucastles throat while he writhed and screamed upon the ground running up i blew its brains out and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck with much labour we separated them and carried him living but horribly mangled into the house we laid him upon the drawingroom sofa and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife i did what i could to relieve his pain we were all assembled round him when the door opened and a tall gaunt woman entered the room mrs toller cried miss hunter yes miss mr rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you ah miss it is a pity you didnt let me know what you were planning for i would have told you that your pains were wasted ha said holmes looking keenly at her it is clear that mrs toller knows more about this matter than anyone else yes sir i do and i am ready enough to tell what i know then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are several points on which i must confess that i am still in the dark i will soon make it clear to you said she and id have done so before now if i could ha got out from the cellar if theres policecourt business over this youll remember that i was the one that stood your friend and that i was miss alices friend too she was never happy at home miss alice wasnt from the time that her father married again she was slighted like and had no say in anything but it never really became bad for her until after she met mr fowler at a friends house as well as i could learn miss alice had rights of her own by will but she was so quiet and patient she was that she never said a word about them but just left everything in mr rucastles hands he knew he was safe with her but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then her father thought it time to put a stop on it he wanted her to sign a paper so that whether she married or not he could use her money when she wouldnt do it he kept on worrying her until she got brainfever and for six weeks was at deaths door then she got better at last all worn to a shadow and with her beautiful hair cut off but that didnt make no change in her young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be ah said holmes i think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear and that i can deduce all that remains mr rucastle then i presume took to this system of imprisonment yes sir and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of mr fowler that was it sir but mr fowler being a persevering man as a good seaman should be blockaded the house and having met you succeeded by certain arguments metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your interests were the same as his mr fowler was a very kindspoken freehanded gentleman said mrs toller serenely and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out you have it sir just as it happened i am sure we owe you an apology mrs toller said holmes for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us and here comes the country surgeon and mrs rucastle so i think watson that we had best escort miss hunter back to winchester as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door mr rucastle survived but was always a broken man kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife they still live with their old servants who probably know so much of rucastles past life that he finds it difficult to part from them mr fowler and miss rucastle were married by special license in southampton the day after their flight and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of mauritius as to miss violet hunter my friend holmes rather to my disappointment manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems and she is now the head of a private school at walsall where i believe that she

chapter 56 chapter 57 chapter 58 chapter 59 chapter 60 chapter 61 chapter 1 it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters my dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last mr bennet replied that he had not but it is returned she for mrs long has just been here and she told me all about it mr bennet made no answer do you not want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it this was invitation enough why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week what is his name bingley is he married or single oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls how so how can it affect them my dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them is that his design in settling here design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley may like you the best of the party my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now when a woman has five grownup daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood it is more than i engage for i assure you but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would be for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no newcomers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not you are overscrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so goodhumoured as lydia but you are always giving her the preference they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take delight in vexing me you have no compassion for my poor nerves you mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least ah you do not know what i suffer but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of threeandtwenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character her mind was less difficult to develop she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news chapter 2 mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it it was then disclosed in the following manner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit but you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long promised to introduce him i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces of her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake have a little compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully when is your next ball to be lizzy tomorrow fortnight aye so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to her impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teasing i honour your circumspection a fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her daughters must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself the girls stared at their father mrs bennet said only nonsense nonsense what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts mary wished to say something sensible but knew not how while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr bingley i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me that before if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now now kitty you may cough as much as you choose said mr bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintances every day but for your sakes we would do anything lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the youngest im the tallest the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner chapter 3 not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas her report was highly favourable sir william had been delighted with him he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party nothing could be more delightful to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr bingleys heart were entertained if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennets visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation etc mrs bennet was quite disconcerted she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man mr bingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion his brotherinlaw mr hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield such amiable qualities must speak for themselves what a contrast between him and his friend mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party his character was decided he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and mr bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it come darcy said he i must have you dance i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better dance i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with i would not be so fastidious as you are cried mr bingley for a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you which do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me mr bingley followed his advice mr darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way elizabeth felt janes pleasure mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants they found mr bennet still up with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations he had rather hoped that his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear oh my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball i wish you had been there jane was so admired nothing could be like it everybody said how well she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time first of all he asked miss lucas i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance so he inquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much for gods sake say no more of his partners oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance oh my dear i am quite delighted with him he is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses i dare say the lace upon mrs hursts gown here she was interrupted again mr bennet protested against any description of finery she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcy but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your setdowns i quite detest the man chapter 4 when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible goodhumoured lively and i never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can his character is thereby complete i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i did not expect such a compliment did not you i did for you but that is one great difference between us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a stupider person dear lizzy oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general you never see a fault in anybody all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life i would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone but i always speak what i think i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour is common enough one meets with it everywhere but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of everybodys character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone and so you like this mans sisters too do you their manners are not equal to his certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it but proud and conceited they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it mr bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now only established as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her mr bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house he did look at it and into it for halfanhour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of great opposition of character bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness and ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied on the strength of darcys regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgement the highest opinion in understanding darcy was the superior bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though wellbred were not inviting in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offense the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they would not object to know more of miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose chapter 5 within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and in quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to everybody by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st jamess had made him courteous lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet they had several children the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven was elizabeths intimate friend that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate you began the evening well charlotte said mrs bennet with civil selfcommand to miss lucas you were mr bingleys first choice yes but he seemed to like his second better oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr robinson perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you mr robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point upon my word well that is very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he poor eliza to be only just tolerable i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for halfanhour without once opening his lips are you quite sure maam is not there a little mistake said jane i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintances with them he is remarkably agreeable i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise i do not mind his not talking to mrs long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you i believe maam i may safely promise you never to dance with him his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right to be proud that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonymously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us if i were as rich as mr darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine a day then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit chapter 6 the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield the visit was soon returned in due form miss bennets pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a women had better show more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should therefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command his attention when she is secure of him there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined with him in company four times this is not quite enough to make her understand his character not as you represent it had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together and four evenings may do a great deal yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingtun better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself occupied in observing mr bingleys attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others his doing so drew her notice it was at sir william lucass where a large party were assembled what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster that is a question which mr darcy only can answer but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did you not think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton with great energy but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic you are severe on us it will be her turn soon to be teased said miss lucas i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers on miss lucass persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must and gravely glancing at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which everybody here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song her performance was pleasing though by no means capital after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy there is nothing like dancing after all i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world every savage can dance sir william only smiled your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do you often dance at st jamess never sir do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it you have a house in town i conclude mr darcy bowed i had once had some thought of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her my dear miss eliza why are you not dancing mr darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one halfhour mr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner elizabeth looked archly and turned away her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley i can guess the subject of your reverie i should imagine not you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the selfimportance of all those people what would i give to hear your strictures on them your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections mr darcy replied with great intrepidity miss elizabeth bennet miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley i am all astonishment how long has she been such a favourite and pray when am i to wish you joy that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask a ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment i knew you would be wishing me joy nay if you are serious about it i shall consider the matter is absolutely settled you will be having a charming motherinlaw indeed and of course she will always be at pemberley with you he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long chapter 7 mr bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothers fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds she had a sister married to a mr phillips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the headquarters their visits to mrs phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves mr phillips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before they could talk of nothing but officers and mr bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr bennet coolly observed from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly of anybodys children it should not be of my own however if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentals mamma cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer mrs bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud my dear friend if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole days teteatete between two women can never end without a quarrel come as soon as you can on receipt of this my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers yours ever caroline bingley with the officers cried lydia i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that dining out said mrs bennet that is very unlucky can i have the carriage said jane no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home oh but the gentlemen will have mr bingleys chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs i had much rather go in the coach but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure they are wanted in the farm mr bennet are they not they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them but if you have got them today said elizabeth my mothers purpose will be answered she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth my dearest lizzy i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will not hear of my returning till i am better they insist also on my seeing mr jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and headache there is not much the matter with me yours etc well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders oh i am not afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriage elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking was her only alternative she declared her resolution how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get there i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ankles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise she was shown into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it she was received however very politely by them and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness mr darcy said very little and mr hurst nothing at all the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone the latter was thinking only of his breakfast her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with elizabeth silently attended her when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for jane the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes chapter 8 at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at halfpast six elizabeth was summoned to dinner to the civil inquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingleys she could not make a very favourable answer jane was by no means better the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others she had very little notice from any but him miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no beauty mrs hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker i shall never forget her appearance this morning she really looked almost wild she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowsy yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice you observed it mr darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition certainly not to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ankles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by it it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence a most countrytown indifference to decorum it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise a short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations with a renewal of tenderness however they returned to her room on leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself on entering the drawingroom she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book mr hurst looked at her with astonishment do you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singular miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever looked into elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcy it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley i wish it may but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it i am talking of possibilities charles upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation elizabeth was so much caught with what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the cardtable and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game is miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or rather taller how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover screens and net purses i scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than halfadozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished nor i i am sure said miss bingley then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman yes i do comprehend a great deal in it oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but halfdeserved all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing any are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room elizabeth bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her bingley urged mr jones being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister chapter 9 elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgement of her situation the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with mrs bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield she would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour bingley met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected indeed i have sir was her answer she is a great deal too ill to be moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass a little longer on your kindness removed cried bingley it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i have ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over the gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth you begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her oh yes i understand you perfectly i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful that is as it happens it does not follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character it must be an amusing study yes but intricate characters are the most amusing they have at least that advantage the country said darcy can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever yes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town everybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal pleasanter is it not mr bingley when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either aye that is because you have the right disposition but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all indeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town which you must acknowledge to be true certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with fourandtwenty families nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance his sister was less delicate and directed her eyes towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away yes she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man sir william is mr bingley is not he so much the man of fashion so genteel and easy he has always something to say to everybody that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter did charlotte dine with you no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mincepies for my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up very differently but everybody is to judge for themselves and the lucases are a very good sort of girls i assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend she seems a very pleasant young woman oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me janes beauty i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see anybody better looking it is what everybody says i do not trust my own partiality when she was only fifteen there was a man at my brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away but however he did not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy of a fine stout healthy love it may everything nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which the attention of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill lydia declared herself satisfied oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not mrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingleys witticisms on fine eyes chapter 10 the day passed much as the day before had done mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawingroom the lootable however did not appear mr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and mrs hurst was observing their game elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in union with her opinion of each how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter he made no answer you write uncommonly fast you are mistaken i write rather slowly how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year letters of business too how odious i should think them it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of yours pray tell your sister that i long to see her i have already told her so once by your desire i am afraid you do not like your pen let me mend it for you i mend pens remarkably well thank you but i always mend my own how can you contrive to write so even he was silent tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantleys will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again at present i have not room to do them justice oh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy my style of writing is very different from yours oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents your humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting the power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i believe what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shown him off now much more than he did himself i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense i see your design bingley said his friend you dislike an argument and want to silence this perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his letter mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for an indulgence of some music miss bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some musicbooks that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcys eyes were fixed on her she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present the supposition did not pain her she liked him too little to care for his approbation after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel she smiled but made no answer he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence oh said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare indeed i do not dare elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity oh yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips be placed in the gallery at pemberley put them next to your greatuncle the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different lines as for your elizabeths picture you must not have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be copied at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard you used us abominably ill answered mrs hurst running away without telling us that you were coming out then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself the path just admitted three mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are you are charmingly grouped and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth goodbye she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening chapter 11 when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawingroom where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared their powers of conversation were considerable they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps he addressed himself to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingleys salutation he was full of joy and attention the first halfhour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace that she might be further from the door he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyone else elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight when tea was over mr hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the cardtable but in vain she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her mr hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bennet miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcys progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of anything than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library no one made any reply she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chooses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked up he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere what could he mean she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in anything and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak you either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i would be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire oh shocking cried miss bingley i never heard anything so abominable how shall we punish him for such a speech nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth we can all plague and punish one another tease him laugh at him intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done but upon my honour i do not i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that tease calmness of manner and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr darcy may hug himself mr darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances i dearly love a laugh miss bingley said he has given me more credit than can be the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i am not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise and good follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without perhaps that is not possible for anyone but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule such as vanity and pride yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation elizabeth turned away to hide a smile your examination of mr darcy is over i presume said miss bingley and pray what is the result i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it himself without disguise no said darcy i have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offenses against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost forever that is a failing indeed cried elizabeth implacable resentment is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i really cannot laugh at it you are safe from me there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome and your defect is to hate everybody and yours he replied with a smile is willfully to misunderstand them do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share louisa you will not mind my waking mr hurst her sister had not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention chapter 12 in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day but mrs bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teasing than usual to himself he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for halfanhour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother mrs bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth they found mary as usual deep in the study of thoroughbass and human nature and had some extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married chapter 13 i hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner today because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her i do not believe she often sees such at home the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger mrs bennets eyes sparkled a gentleman and a stranger it is mr bingley i am sure well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got today lydia my love ring the bell i must speak to hill this moment it is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases oh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it jane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail they had often attempted to do it before but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself no that i am sure i shall not and i think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false friends why could he not keep on quarreling with you as his father did before him why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear hunsford near westerham kent 15th october dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance there mrs bennet my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olivebranch i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 18th by four oclock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday seennight following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your wellwisher and friend william collins at four oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentleman said mr bennet as he folded up the letter he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required he must be an oddity i think said she i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could could he be a sensible man sir no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him in point of composition said mary the letter does not seem defective the idea of the olivebranch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour as for their mother mr collinss letter had done away much of her illwill and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family mr bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was a tall heavylooking young man of fiveandtwenty his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs bennet who quarreled with no compliments answered most readily you are very kind i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so oddly you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate ah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other they were not the only objects of mr collinss admiration the hall the diningroom and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs bennets heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing but he was set right there by mrs bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen he begged pardon for having displeased her in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour chapter 14 during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness lady catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable mr bennet could not have chosen better mr collins was eloquent in her praise the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine she had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen anything but affability in her she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself some shelves in the closet up stairs that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her does she live near you sir the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyships residence i think you said she was a widow sir has she any family she has only one daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property ah said mrs bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls and what sort of young lady is she is she handsome she is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at court her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay you judge very properly said mr bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible mr bennets expectations were fully answered his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure by teatime however the dose had been enough and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies mr collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for everything announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose fordyces sermons lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with do you know mamma that my uncle phillips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr collins much offended laid aside his book and said i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction but i will no longer importune my young cousin then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon mr bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements mrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but mr collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no illwill and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with mr bennet and prepared for backgammon chapter 15 mr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his right as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness selfimportance and humility having now a good house and a very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to choose one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their fathers estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part his plan did not vary on seeing them miss bennets lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settled choice the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hours teteatete with mrs bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress might be found for it at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs bennet was stirring the fire elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course mrs bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr collins was to attend them at the request of mr bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely pleased to close his large book and go in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recall them but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking with another officer on the other side of the way the officer was the very mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed all were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot mr denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her mr darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting both changed colour one looked white the other red mr wickham after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return what could be the meaning of it it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know in another minute mr bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr phillips house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias pressing entreaties that they should come in and even in spite of mrs phillipss throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation mrs phillips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr joness shopboy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by janes introduction of him she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice mrs phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenants commission in the shire she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows some of them were to dine with the phillipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening this was agreed to and mrs phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be in the wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs phillipss manners and politeness he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life chapter 16 as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt and all mr collinss scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawingroom that mr wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs phillips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherines drawingrooms and found that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeepers room in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs phillips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece the interval of waiting appeared very long it was over at last however the gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle phillips breathing port wine who followed them into the room mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night made her feel that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the officers mr collins seemed to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs phillips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin when the cardtables were placed he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn by sitting down to whist i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation in life mrs phillips was very glad for his compliance but could not wait for his reason mr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia at first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy she dared not even mention that gentleman her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved mr wickham began the subject himself he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in a hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand yes replied mr wickham his estate there is a noble one a clear ten thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy elizabeth could not but look surprised you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth very warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else here you are in your own family upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield he is not at all liked in hertfordshire everybody is disgusted with his pride you will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chooses to be seen i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an illtempered man wickham only shook his head i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood oh no it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim before all the world a sense of very great illusage and most painful regrets at his being what he is his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances meryton had procured them society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude i must have employment and society a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now indeed yes the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere good heavens cried elizabeth but how could that be how could his will be disregarded why did you not seek legal redress there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short anything or nothing certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i may have spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely i can recall nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them but what said she after a pause can have been his motive what can have induced him to behave so cruelly a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must be dreadful i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardly be just to him elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his father she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr phillips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up everything to be of use to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most intimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence and when immediately before my fathers death mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of his affection to myself how strange cried elizabeth how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty i must call it it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride had often been his best friend it has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers what sort of girl is miss darcy he shook his head i wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy but she is too much like her brother very very proud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement but she is nothing to me now she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her fathers death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you know mr bingley not at all he is a sweettempered amiable charming man he cannot know what mr darcy is probably not but mr darcy can please where he chooses he does not want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberalminded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs phillips the usual inquiries as to his success was made by the latter it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs phillips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged that she would not make herself uneasy i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a cardtable they must take their chances of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters mr wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy no indeed i did not i knew nothing at all of lady catherines connections i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already selfdestined for another mr collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride for her nephew who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickhams attentions there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs phillipss supper party but his manners recommended him to everybody whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully elizabeth went away with her head full of him she could think of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr and mrs phillips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house chapter 17 elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr wickham and herself jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham the possibility of his having endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing remained therefore to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody laugh as much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of my opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it is impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him oh no i can much more easily believe mr bingleys being imposed on than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts everything mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his looks it is difficult indeed it is distressing one does not know what to think i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think but jane could think with certainty on only one point that mr bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the longexpected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennets civilities the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of her brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr darcys look and behaviour the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough i think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody elizabeths spirits were so high on this occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingleys invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance i am by no means of the opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her elizabeth felt herself completely taken in she had fully proposed being engaged by mr wickham for those very dances and to have mr collins instead her liveliness had never been worse timed there was no help for it however mr wickhams happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer and mr collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her elizabeth however did not choose to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply mr collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia chapter 18 till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcys pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make attendance forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of illhumour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality provoked her but elizabeth was not formed for illhumour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice the first two dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification mr collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give the moment of her release from him was ecstasy she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her i dare say you will find him very agreeable heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance he replied and was again silent after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and by i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent do you talk by rule then while you are dancing sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly i must not decide on my own performance he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance the effect was immediate a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr darcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to the first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to mr darcy but let me not interrupt you sir you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine what think you of books said he smiling books oh no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions no i cannot talk of books in a ballroom my head is always full of something else the present always occupies you in such scenes does it said he with a look of doubt yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created i am said he with a firm voice and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice i hope not it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first may i ask to what these questions tend merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity i am trying to make it out and what is your success she shook her head i do not get on at all i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly i can readily believe answered he gravely that reports may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence and on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcys breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you among his other communication that he was the son of old wickham the late mr darcys steward let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has always been remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcys steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer excuse my interference it was kindly meant insolent girl said elizabeth to herself you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy she then sought her eldest sister who has undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and everything else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sisters what you have learnt about mr wickham but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sisters mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcys regard mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am satisfied but what does he say of the living he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only i have not a doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr bingleys defense of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as i did before she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of mr bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy indeed i am i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier i believe him to be lady catherines nephew it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennight elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility mr collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way mr collins then returned to elizabeth i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters her mothers thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon be married to mr bingley it was an animating subject and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear for heavens sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be for you to offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing nothing that she could say however had any influence her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity at length however mrs bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken elizabeth now began to revive but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected elizabeth was in agonies she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however imperturbably grave she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child you have delighted us long enough let the other young ladies have time to exhibit mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good others of the party were now applied to if i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to the rector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room many stared many smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed that his two sisters and mr darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable the rest of the evening brought her little amusement she was teased by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening there was no arguing upon such a project she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and goodnaturedly engaged mr collinss conversation to herself she was at least free from the offense of mr darcys further notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham and rejoiced in it the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests darcy said nothing at all mr bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself especially to mr bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months of having another daughter married to mr collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield chapter 19 the next day opened a new scene at longbourn mr collins made his declaration in form having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business on finding mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise mrs bennet answered instantly oh dear yes certainly i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you up stairs and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear madam do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear i am going away myself no no nonsense lizzy i desire you to stay where you are and upon elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moments consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion mrs bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr collins began believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mothers permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did the idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said mr collins you must marry a clergyman like you must marry choose properly choose a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond anything i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i can assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents which will not be yours till after your mothers decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now you are too hasty sir she cried you forget that i have made no answer let me do it without further loss of time accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who could make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr collins very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you and you may be certain when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualification indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any selfreproach this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had mr collins not thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character really mr collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into further consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females i do assure you sir that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect forbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female chapter 20 mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect or their nearer connection mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character this information however startled mrs bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not believe it and could not help saying so but depend upon it mr collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason i will speak to her about it directly she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs bennet alarmed lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these in everything else she is as goodnatured a girl as ever lived i will go directly to mr bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech of what are you talking of mr collins and lizzy lizzy declares she will not have mr collins and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy and what am i to do on the occasion it seems an hopeless business speak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon her marrying him let her be called down she shall hear my opinion mrs bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library come here child cried her father as she appeared i have sent for you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage is it true elizabeth replied that it was very well and this offer of marriage you have refused i have sir very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your accepting it is it not so mrs bennet yes or i will never see her again an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you do elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed what do you mean mr bennet in talking this way you promised me to insist upon her marrying him my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs bennet give up the point she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks though her manner varied however her determination never did mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here what do you think has happened this morning mr collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him charlotte hardly had time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfastroom where mrs bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth aye there she comes continued mrs bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way but i tell you miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you i have done with you from this very day i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to anybody people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i suffer but it is always so those who do not complain are never pitied her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritation she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins who entered the room with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let me and mr collins have a little conversation together elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear in a doleful voice mrs bennet began the projected conversation oh mr collins my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation you will not i hope consider me as showing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own but we are all liable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise chapter 21 the discussion of mr collinss offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennets illhumour or ill health mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he meant to stay after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody was well talked over to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been selfimposed i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hotpressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again you shall hear what she says she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine in grosvenor street where mr hurst had a house the next was in these words i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence i depend on you for that to these highflown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingleys being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by them caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter i wish that i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one of the crowd but of that i despair i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he should why will you think so it must be his own doing he is his own master but you do not know all i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from you mr darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisters partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any womans heart with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many what do you think of this sentence my dear lizzy said jane as she finished it is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject yes there can for mine is totally different will you hear it most willingly you shall have it in a few words miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to town in hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you jane shook her head indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him how can you talk so said jane faintly smiling you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required a thousand things may arise in six months the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses chapter 22 the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them towards herself such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday his reception however was of the most flattering kind miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there in as short a time as mr collinss long speeches would allow everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity mr collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st jamess the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes dying an old maid charlotte herself was tolerably composed she had gained her point and had time to consider of it her reflections were in general satisfactory mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary but still he would be her husband without thinking highly either of men or matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only provision for welleducated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twentyseven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great selfdenial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible they were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my good sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness my dear sir replied mr collins i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyships concurrence you cannot be too much upon your guard risk anything rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before the possibility of mr collinss fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to mr collins my dear charlotte impossible the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you but when you have had time to think it over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i never was i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collinss character connection and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match the strangeness of mr collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she had not supposed it to be possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage charlotte the wife of mr collins was a most humiliating picture and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen chapter 23 elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family with many compliments to them and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord sir william how can you tell such a story do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day nothing could console and nothing could appease her nor did that day wear out her resentment a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter mr bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again the promised letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men mr collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs bennet on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingleys continued absence neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently occurring the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment as for jane her anxiety under this suspense was of course more painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used it needed all janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity mr collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of lovemaking relieved them from a great deal of his company the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state the very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of illhumour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of the sight of miss lucas was odious to her as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were dead she complained bitterly of all this to her husband indeed mr bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take her place in it my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for better things let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was not for the entail i should not mind it what should not you mind i should not mind anything at all let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility i never can be thankful mr bennet for anything about the entail how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr collins too why should he have it more than anybody else i leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennet chapter 24 miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others to carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best but her sisters was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whatever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally wounded a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs bennets leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying oh that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but i will not repine it cannot last long he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with thank god i have not that pain a little time therefore i shall certainly try to get the better with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too good your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sisters warm affection nay said elizabeth this is not fair you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal goodwill you need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlottes marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper consider mr collinss respectability and charlottes steady prudent character remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for everybodys sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin to oblige you i would try to believe almost anything but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collins is a conceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together but enough of this you alluded to something else you mentioned two instances i cannot misunderstand you but i entreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than it does and men take care that they should if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine i am far from attributing any part of mr bingleys conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution will do the business and do you impute it to either of those yes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem stop me whilst you can you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him yes in conjunction with his friend i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it your first position is false they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is light it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day mrs bennets best comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer mr bennet treated the matter differently so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to being married a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then it is something to think of and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane now is your time here are officers enough in meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let wickham be your man he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect janes good fortune true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it mr wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known anything of the matter miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men chapter 25 after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks on the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn mr gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so wellbred and agreeable mrs gardiner who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs phillips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a particular regard they had frequently been staying with her in town the first part of mrs gardiners business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions when this was done she had a less active part to play it became her turn to listen mrs bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of they had all been very illused since she last saw her sister two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collinss wife by this time had it not been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that the longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves mrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she i am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as often applied to feelings which arise from a halfhours acquaintance as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingleys love i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sisters ready acquiescence i hope added mrs gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable that they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley never stirs without him so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane correspond with his sister she will not be able to help calling she will drop the acquaintance entirely but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractions miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped by carolines not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn and what with the phillipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm commendation narrowly observed them both without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment to mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged they had therefore many acquaintances in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring mrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself on being made acquainted with the present mr darcys treatment of him she tried to remember some of that gentlemans reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud illnatured boy chapter 26 mrs gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all expect you to use it your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father my dear aunt this is being serious indeed yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it elizabeth you are not serious now i beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudence of it oh that abominable mr darcy my fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it my father however is partial to mr wickham in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellowcreatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short i will do my best perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagine that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week you know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be the wisest and now i hope you are satisfied her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that she wished they might be happy thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room as they went downstairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza that you certainly shall and i have another favour to ask you will you come and see me we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire i am not likely to leave kent for some time promise me therefore to come to hunsford elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit my father and maria are coming to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be as welcome as either of them the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging it was mr collinss picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost my aunt she continued is going tomorrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her i inquired after their brother of course he was well but so much engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner i wish i could see her my visit was not long as caroline and mrs hurst were going out i dare say i shall see them soon here elizabeth shook her head over this letter it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr bingley her sisters being in town four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement at my expense when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the meantime when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer i pity though i cannot help blaming her she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long ago he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it would seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy i cannot understand it if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear from you very soon miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty we had better not mention it i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford pray go to see them with sir william and maria i am sure you will be very comfortable there yours etc this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over she would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in this case than in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss king i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my watchfulness has been effectual and though i certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain chapter 27 with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away march was to take elizabeth to hunsford she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr collins there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay everything however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of everybody would always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing her fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable sir william lucas and his daughter maria a goodhumoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir williams too long he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information it was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon as they drove to mr gardiners door jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower all was joy and kindness the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt their first object was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute inquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurch street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think she is a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm of her but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers death made her mistress of this fortune no why should he if it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor but there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe if she does not object to it why should we her not objecting does not justify him it only shows her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling well cried elizabeth have it as you choose he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish no lizzy that is what i do not choose i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going tomorrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer we have not determined how far it shall carry us said mrs gardiner but perhaps to the lakes no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful oh my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour adieu to disappointment and spleen what are young men to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transport we shall spend and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of anything we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarreling about its relative situation let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers chapter 28 every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view the palings of rosings park was their boundary on one side elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants at length the parsonage was discernible the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge everything declared they were arriving mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received she saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him but though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion when mr collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself to work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump but of all the views which his garden or which the country or kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground from his garden mr collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of showing it without her husbands help it was rather small but well built and convenient and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit when mr collins could be forgotten there was really an air of great comfort throughout and by charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us i should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had already been written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings a lively imagination soon settled it all about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the diningroom for there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make haste and come down this moment elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate and is this all cried elizabeth i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them the other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little creature who would have thought that she could be so thin and small she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind why does she not come in oh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas she looks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well she will make him a very proper wife mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day chapter 29 mr collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as this who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for anything more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st jamess as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh when they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm elizabeths courage did not fail her she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation from the entrancehall of which mr collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and the finished ornaments they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs jenkinson were sitting her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary in spite of having been at st jamess sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly lady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her selfimportance and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he represented when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his soninlaw said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them the party did not supply much conversation elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinnertime mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire when the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted she inquired into charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden name elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly lady catherine then observed your fathers estate is entailed on mr collins i think for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourghs family do you play and sing miss bennet a little oh then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day do your sisters play and sing one of them does why did not you all learn you ought all to have learned the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as yours do you draw no not at all what none of you not one that is very strange but i suppose you had no opportunity your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london has your governess left you we never had any governess no governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing your mother must have been quite a slave to your education elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must have been neglected compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be idle certainly might aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way i am always glad to get a young person well placed out four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her mrs collins did i tell you of lady metcalfs calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet yes maam all all what all five out at once very odd and you only the second the younger ones out before the elder ones are married your younger sisters must be very young yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much in company but really maam i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early the lastborn has as good a right to the pleasures of youth at the first and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person pray what is your age with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age i am not oneandtwenty when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the cardtables were placed lady catherine sir william and mr and mrs collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her party their table was superlatively stupid scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light a great deal more passed at the other table lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself mr collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many sir william did not say much he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broken up the carriage was offered to mrs collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departed as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands chapter 30 sir william stayed only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with while sir william was with them mr collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of the window in his own bookroom which fronted the road the room in which the ladies sat was backwards elizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the diningparlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a more pleasant aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs collinss joints of meat were too large for her family elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one cardtable in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first their other engagements were few as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond mr collinss reach this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were halfhours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him charlotte had seen them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the doorbell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend met her with every appearance of composure elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs collins sat for some time without speaking to anybody at length however his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of elizabeth after the health of her family she answered him in the usual way and after a moments pause added my eldest sister has been in town these three months have you never happened to see her there she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away chapter 31 colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at rosings it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easterday almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening for the last week they had seen very little of lady catherine or her daughter colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had seen only at church the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherines drawingroom her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them anything was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr darcy his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam what is it you are talking of what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it is we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply of music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed delightfully how does georgiana get on darcy mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice she practises very constantly so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in mrs jenkinsons room she would be in nobodys way you know in that part of the house mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts illbreeding and made no answer when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument he drew a chair near her lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me i shall not say you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear i am not afraid of you said he smilingly pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam i should like to know how he behaves among strangers you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ballroom well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am illqualified to recommend myself to strangers shall we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him it is because he will not give himself the trouble i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i will not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right you have employed your time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting we neither of us perform to strangers here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of elizabeth immediately began playing again lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to annes anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home chapter 32 elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her halffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy and mr darcy only entered the room he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within they then sat down and when her inquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london perfectly so i thank you she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future he has many friends and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers elizabeth made no answer she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object mr collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her it must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a days journey yes i call it a very easy distance i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire anything beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment you cannot have been always at longbourn elizabeth looked surprised the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from her walk the teteatete surprised them mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody went away what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was gone my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called us in this familiar way but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do which was the more probable from the time of year all field sports were over within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiardtable but gentlemen cannot always be within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners she believed he might have the best informed mind but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself he seldom appeared really animated mrs collins knew not what to make of him colonel fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she set herself seriously to work to find it out she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all chapter 33 more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr darcy she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd yet it did and even a third it seemed like wilful illnature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too his words seemed to imply it could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts she supposed if he meant anything he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage she was engaged one day as she walked in perusing janes last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage are you going much farther no i should have turned in a moment and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together do you certainly leave kent on saturday said she yes if darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he arranges the business just as he pleases and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice i do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to selfdenial and dependence in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either now seriously what have you ever known of selfdenial and dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from want of money younger sons cannot marry where they like unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do our habits of expense make us too dependent and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money is this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earls younger son unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy are you indeed and pray what sort of guardians do you make does your charge give you much trouble young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth she directly replied you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them i know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man he is a great friend of darcys oh yes said elizabeth drily mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him care of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant it was all conjecture what is it you mean it is a circumstance which darcy could not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an unpleasant thing you may depend upon my not mentioning it and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer did mr darcy give you reasons for this interference i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady and what arts did he use to separate them he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling he only told me what i have now told you elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she your cousins conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge you are rather disposed to call his interference officious i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friends inclination or why upon his own judgement alone he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the parsonage there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected there could not exist in the world two men over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliams words and those strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating neither could anything be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities mr darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach when she thought of her mother her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friends connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea mrs collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being rather displeased by her staying at home chapter 34 when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone had been scarcely ever clouded elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal mr darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferings it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the doorbell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to inquire particularly after her but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walk into the room in an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better she answered him with cold civility he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room elizabeth was surprised but said not a word after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began in vain i have struggled it will not do my feelings will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression she stared coloured doubted and was silent this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation mr darcy who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it the pause was to elizabeths feelings dreadful at length with a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance i might as well inquire replied she why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity can you deny that you have done it she repeated with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been kinder than towards myself elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offenses might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by everything but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification she went on from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house the tumult of her mind was now painfully great she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for halfanhour her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy that he should have been in love with her for so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited she continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room chapter 35 elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of anything else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr darcys sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led farther from the turnpikeroad the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr darcy she was directly retreating but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the gate he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you will you do me the honour of reading that letter and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letterpaper written quite through in a very close hand the envelope itself was likewise full pursuing her way along the lane she then began it it was dated from rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice two offenses of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr wickham wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in the future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry the necessity must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment i had often seen him in love before at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided from that moment i observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him your sister i also watched her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in error your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me these causes must be stated though briefly the situation of your mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father pardon me it pains me to offend you but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning the part which i acted is now to be explained his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice i described and enforced them earnestly but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving of your sisters indifference he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment i cannot blame myself for having done thus much there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and it was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his godson his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education my father was not only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr darcy could not have here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character it adds even another motive my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited he had some intention he added of studying law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman the business was therefore soon settled he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds all connection between us seemed now dissolved i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition to it his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped how he lived i know not but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me you may imagine what i felt and how i acted regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left the place immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge mr wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement his revenge would have been complete indeed this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed for the truth of everything here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning i will only add god bless you fitzwilliam darcy chapter 36 if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents but such as they were it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal with a strong prejudice against everything he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes his belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty it was all pride and insolence but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err but when she read and reread with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success on both sides it was only assertion again she read on but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at mr wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of inquiring his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance but no such recollection befriended her she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read but alas the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no reason to question at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr phillipss many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy that mr darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr darcys character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at anything his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of mr darcy she could not but allow that mr bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling that had his actions been what mr wickham represented them so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr bingley was incomprehensible she grew absolutely ashamed of herself of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd how despicably i have acted she cried i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned till this moment i never knew myself from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcys explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again widely different was the effect of a second perusal how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other he declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachment and she could not help remembering what charlottes opinion had always been neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane she felt that janes feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been selfattracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought reconsidering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object she could think only of her letter chapter 37 the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyships indignation would have been what would she have said how would she have behaved were questions with which she amused herself their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as i do but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year his attachment to rosings certainly increases mr collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it by herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer mrs collins will be very glad of your company i am sure i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it i must be in town next saturday why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks i expected you to stay two months i told mrs collins so before you came there can be no occasion for your going so soon mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight but my father cannot he wrote last week to hurry my return oh your father of course may spare you if your mother can daughters are never of so much consequence to a father and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouchebox there will be very good room for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan lady catherine seemed resigned mrs collins you must send a servant with them you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves it is highly improper you must contrive to send somebody i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two menservants go with her miss darcy the daughter of mr darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner i am excessively attentive to all those things you must send john with the young ladies mrs collins i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone my uncle is to send a servant for us oh your uncle he keeps a manservant does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things where shall you change horses oh bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections mr darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin they were hopeless of remedy her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence what chance could there be of improvement catherine weakspirited irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia selfwilled and careless would scarcely give them a hearing they were ignorant idle and vain while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there forever anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern and mr darcys explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family when to these recollections was added the development of wickhams character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first the very last evening was spent there and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both chapter 38 on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her feel the obliged mr collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied it gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are you see how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so lady catherines great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each other elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang poor charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to such society but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to mr and mrs gardiner though unknown he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at rosings but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off good gracious cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell elizabeth added privately and how much i shall have to conceal their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr gardiners house where they were to remain a few days jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr darcys proposals to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister further chapter 39 it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennets carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a diningroom up stairs these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a salad and cucumber after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice is not this an agreeable surprise and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there then showing her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight are they indeed cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all mamma would like to go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down at table what do you think it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person we all like jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told he need not stay lydia laughed and said aye that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is it not there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king theres for you she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay wickham is safe and mary king is safe added elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune she is a great fool for going away if she liked him but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane i am sure there is not on his i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her who could about such a nasty little freckled thing elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kittys and lydias purchases were seated in it how nicely we are all crammed in cried lydia i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away have you seen any pleasant men have you had any flirting i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare she is almost threeandtwenty lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before threeandtwenty my aunt phillips wants you so to get husbands you cant think she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it lord how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls dear me we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forsters kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs forster and me are such friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did we dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun not a soul knew of it but colonel and mrs forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs forster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name their reception at home was most kind mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth i am glad you are come back lizzy their party in the diningroom was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects that occupied them lady lucas was inquiring of maria after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other persons was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her oh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun as we went along kitty and i drew up the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that anybody might have heard us ten miles off to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for me i should infinitely prefer a book but of this answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and to see how everybody went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers there was another reason too for her opposition she dreaded seeing mr wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible the comfort to her of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last chapter 40 elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him blame you oh no but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did but you will know it when i tell you what happened the very next day she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham what a stroke was this for poor jane who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual nor was darcys vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear the one without involving the other this will not do said elizabeth you never will be able to make both of them good for anything take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all darcys but you shall do as you choose it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane i do not know when i have been more shocked said she wickham so very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of his sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it so oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason it is such a spur to ones genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually abusive without saying anything just but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i may say unhappy and with no one to speak to about what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintances in general understand wickhams character miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully what is your opinion that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is some time hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will say nothing about it you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to reestablish a character we must not make him desperate the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbade the disclosure she dared not relate the other half of mr darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits jane was not happy she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity well lizzy said mrs bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of janes for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody i told my sister phillips so the other day but i cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose theres the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have inquired of everybody too who is likely to know i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any more oh well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come though i shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they well well i only hope it will last and what sort of table do they keep charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say no nothing at all a great deal of good management depend upon it yes yes they will take care not to outrun their income they will never be distressed for money well much good may it do them and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead they look upon it as quite their own i dare say whenever that happens it was a subject which they could not mention before me no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me chapter 41 the first week of their return was soon gone the second began it was the last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace the dejection was almost universal the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hardheartedness in any of the family good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe how can you be smiling so lizzy their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion fiveandtwenty years ago i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel millers regiment went away i thought i should have broken my heart i am sure i shall break mine said lydia if one could but go to brighton observed mrs bennet oh yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable a little seabathing would set me up forever and my aunt phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kitty such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame she felt anew the justice of mr darcys objections and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs forster the delight of mrs bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy calling for everyones congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home he heard her attentively and then said lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair already arisen repeated mr bennet what has she frightened away some of your lovers poor little lizzy but do not be cast down such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret come let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydias folly indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not of particular but of general evils which i am now complaining our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydias character excuse me for i must speak plainly if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger kitty also is comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrolled oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathingplace covered with officers she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving home elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of formal partiality entirely so she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal on the very last day of the regiments remaining at meryton he dined with other of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he was acquainted with the former he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man asked her how she had liked him her answer was warmly in his favour with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you say he was at rosings nearly three weeks and you saw him frequently yes almost every day his manners are very different from his cousins yes very different but i think mr darcy improves upon acquaintance indeed cried mr wickham with a look which did not escape her and pray may i ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials oh no said elizabeth in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feeling towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no further attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard chapter 42 had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so illjudged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a wateringplace and a camp upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs forster called her and they were going off to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn everything wore a happier aspect the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in meryton the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me the period of expectation was now doubled four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival but they did pass away and mr and mrs gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them playing with them and loving them the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness of companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay oxford blenheim warwick kenilworth birmingham etc are sufficiently known a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs gardiners former residence and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it in talking over their route the evening before mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again mr gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much said her aunt a place too with which so many of your acquaintances are connected wickham passed all his youth there you know elizabeth was distressed she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it she must own that she was tired of seeing great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains mrs gardiner abused her stupidity if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful they have some of the finest woods in the country elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce the possibility of meeting mr darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms now being removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme to pemberley therefore they were to go chapter 43 elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter the park was very large and contained great variety of ground they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view they gradually ascended for halfamile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned elizabeth was delighted she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was the housekeeper came a respectablelooking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her they followed her into the diningparlour it was a large well proportioned room handsomely fitted up elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect the hill crowned with wood which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendour and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but no recollecting herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something very like regret she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent but had not the courage for it at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow with a large party of friends how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day her aunt now called her to look at a picture she approached and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantelpiece her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it the housekeeper came forward and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been brought up by him at his own expense he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it and that said mrs reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my master and very like him it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago i have heard much of your masters fine person said mrs gardiner looking at the picture it is a handsome face but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not mrs reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master does that young lady know mr darcy elizabeth coloured and said a little and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman maam yes very handsome i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then he was very fond of them this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickhams being among them mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mrs gardiner oh yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished she plays and sings all day long in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master she comes here tomorrow with him mr gardiner whose manners were very easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds either by pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate if your master would marry you might see more of him yes sir but i do not know when that will be i do not know who is good enough for him mr and mrs gardiner smiled elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so i say no more than the truth and everybody will say that knows him replied the other elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never known a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinion her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in having such a master yes sir i know i am if i were to go through the world i could not meet with a better but i have always observed that they who are goodnatured when children are goodnatured when they grow up and he was always the sweetesttempered most generoushearted boy in the world elizabeth almost stared at her can this be mr darcy thought she his father was an excellent man said mrs gardiner yes maam that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more mrs reynolds could interest her on no other point she related the subjects of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain mr gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing but themselves there is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw anything of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men in what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeth this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend perhaps we might be deceived that is not very likely our authority was too good on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sittingroom lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should enter the room and this is always the way with him she added whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there is nothing he would not do for her the picturegallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were all that remained to be shown in the former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance to mr darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery mrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers lifetime there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow how much of good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned downstairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the halldoor as they walked across the hall towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her having stayed in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave the others then joined her and expressed admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence she was overpowered by shame and vexation her coming there was the most unfortunate the most illjudged thing in the world how strange it must appear to him in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come or why did he thus come a day before he was expected had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean that he should even speak to her was amazing but to speak with such civility to inquire after her family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think or how to account for it they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then was she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything she was still dear to him perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds when in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy approaching them and at no great distance the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed her colour changed and she said no more mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions that he was surprised by the connection was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardiner elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport mrs gardiner who was walking arminarm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of wonder elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered from what can it proceed it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this it is impossible that he should still love me after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious waterplant there chanced to be a little alteration it originated in mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together after a short silence the lady first spoke she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till tomorrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling they will join me early tomorrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters elizabeth answered only by a slight bow her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingleys name had been the last mentioned between them and if she might judge by his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward she wanted to talk but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the teteatete was over on mr and mrs gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with utmost politeness mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his features are perfectly good but how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they had met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character but said nothing from what we have seen of him continued mrs gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham he has not an illnatured look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickhams so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr darcys civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister chapter 44 elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their arrival at lambton these visitors came they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business nothing had ever suggested it before but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece while these newlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was at every moment increasing she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings they had not long been together before mr darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room all elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again he inquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever done to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself they had long wished to see him the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention the suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough elizabeth on her side had much to do she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival to jane no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from selfconsequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings their visitors stayed with them above halfanhour and when they arose to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed mrs gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many inquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last halfhour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little eager to be alone and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiners curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her they saw much to interest but nothing to justify inquiry of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr darcy there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small markettown where the family did not visit it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a wellknown fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards discharged as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she certainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked it was gratitude gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece that such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning they were therefore to go elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon chapter 45 convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed on reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn in this house they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with all the embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved mrs gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments it was first broken by mrs annesley a genteel agreeablelooking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly wellbred than either of the others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much her own thoughts were employing her she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over miss darcy on her brothers entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton they must be a great loss to your family in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone while she spoke an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys meditated elopement to no creature had it been revealed where secrecy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from the very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should effect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person behaviour and dress but georgiana would not join her her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgement could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy she cried i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again however little mr darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i could never see anything extraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency without fashion which is intolerable persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty i should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first saw her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both the look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of everything but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject chapter 46 elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves the one missent must first be attended to it had been written five days ago the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence it was to this effect since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well what i have to say relates to poor lydia an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham imagine our surprise to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected i am very very sorry so imprudent a match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing our poor mother is sadly grieved my father bears it better how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed imprudent as the marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express though lydias short letter to mrs f gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off from b intending to trace their route he did trace them easily to clapham but no further for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road i know not what to think after making every possible inquiry on that side london colonel f came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs f but no one can throw any blame on them our distress my dear lizzy is very great my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to everything impossible i grieve to find however that colonel f is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w was not a man to be trusted my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again tomorrow evening in such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance would be everything in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness oh where where is my uncle cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and before he could recover himself to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose good god what is the matter cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence at length she spoke again i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from anyone my younger sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of mr wickham they are gone off together from brighton you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever darcy was fixed in astonishment when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened but it is all all too late now i am grieved indeed cried darcy grieved shocked but is it certain absolutely certain oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in halfanhour but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done how is such a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered i have not the smallest hope it is every way horrible darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence when my eyes were opened to his real character oh had i known what i ought what i dared to do but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much wretched wretched mistake darcy made no answer he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it her power was sinking everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain but self though it would intrude could not engross her lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to everything else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley today oh yes be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy say that urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty but if otherwise if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydias infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business never since reading janes second letter had she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation surprise was the least of her feelings on this development while the contents of the first letter remained in her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible but now it was all too natural for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl oh how acutely did she now feel it she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room her impatience was severe mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy though lydia had never been a favourite with them mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardiner promised every assistance in his power elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit everything relating to their journey was speedily settled they were to be off as soon as possible but what is to be done about pemberley cried mrs gardiner john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us was it so yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement that is all settled what is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth oh that i knew how it was but wishes were vain or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure an hour however saw the whole completed and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn chapter 47 i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk do you really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment upon my word said mrs gardiner i begin to be of your uncles opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case in the first place replied mr gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland oh but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptional purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attraction has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last halfyear nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so very ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would think capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating and do you really know all this cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her but does lydia know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand oh yes that that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a consequence as this could ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had anything of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent fixed there by the keenest of all anguish selfreproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them a hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down from her mothers apartment immediately met her elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives not yet replied jane but now that my dear uncle is come i hope everything will be well is my father in town yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word and have you heard from him often we have heard only twice he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention and my mother how is she how are you all my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all she does not yet leave her dressingroom mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well but you how are you cried elizabeth you look pale how much you must have gone through her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears when they were all in the drawingroom the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce their marriage mrs bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and illusage blaming everybody but the person to whose illjudging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing if i had been able said she to carry my point in going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was overruled as i always am poor dear child and now heres mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done oh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them after they are married and above all keep mr bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frighted out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fear and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before one came from her books and the other from her toilette the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for halfanhour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard give me further particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing anything of their plans and would not give his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks but not before they went to brighton no i believe not and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself does he know his real character i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened perhaps it would have been better replied her sister but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable we acted with the best intentions could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his wife he brought it with him for us to see jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth these were the contents my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i am missed i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for laughing pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up goodbye give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey your affectionate friend lydia bennet oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had finished it what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it i never saw anyone so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties your attendance upon her has been too much for you you do not look well oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt phillips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they should be of use to us she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of ones neighbours assistance is impossible condolence insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come with a fare from london and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make inquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this chapter 48 the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it he added that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon there was also a postscript to this effect i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence at present we have nothing to guide us colonel forster will i dare say do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected the arrival of letters was the grand object of every mornings impatience through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parents mind the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace let me then advise you dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense i am dear sir etc etc mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send it was not known that wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living his former acquaintances had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton he owed a good deal in town but his debts of honour were still more formidable mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror a gamester she cried this is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday rendered spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brotherinlaws entreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit when mrs bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before what is he coming home and without poor lydia she cried sure he will not leave london before he has found them who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and the children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet came from it the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydias infamy somewhat better it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two when mr bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it it was not till the afternoon when he had joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth you may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone to fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression it will pass away soon enough do you suppose them to be in london yes where else can they be so well concealed and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there will probably be of some duration then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no illwill for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shows some greatness of mind they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers tea this is a parade he cried which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my nightcap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia you go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne for fifty pounds no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter into my house again nor even to pass through the village balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry well well said he do not make yourself unhappy if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them chapter 49 two days after mr bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town dear madam cried mrs hill in great astonishment dont you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner he has been here this halfhour and master has had a letter away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech they ran through the vestibule into the breakfastroom from thence to the library their father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said if you are looking for my master maam he is walking towards the little copse upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle yes i have had a letter from him by express well and what news does it bring good or bad what is there of good to be expected said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand jane now came up read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is about gracechurch street monday august 2 my dear brother at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope it will give you satisfaction soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were the particulars i reserve till we meet it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married elizabeth read on i have seen them both they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum these are conditions which considering everything i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickhams circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quiet at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care send back your answer as fast as you can and be careful to write explicitly we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve she comes to us today i shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on yours etc edw gardiner is it possible cried elizabeth when she had finished can it be possible that he will marry her wickham is not so undeserving then as we thought him said her sister my dear father i congratulate you and have you answered the letter cried elizabeth no but it must be done soon most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time before he wrote oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately consider how important every moment is in such a case let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house and may i ask said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so little and they must marry yet he is such a man yes yes they must marry there is nothing else to be done but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how am i ever to pay him money my uncle cried jane what do you mean sir i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncles doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself a small sum could not do all this no said her father wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be repaid mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house their father then went on to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfastroom and they are really to be married cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves how strange this is and for this we are to be thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds if he were ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor anybody can ever forget it is useless to talk of it it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied just as you please may we take my uncles letter to read to her take whatever you like and get away elizabeth took the letter from his writingtable and they went up stairs together mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet one communication would therefore do for all after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud mrs bennet could hardly contain herself as soon as jane had read mr gardiners hope of lydias being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation to know that her daughter would be married was enough she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct my dear dear lydia she cried this is delightful indeed she will be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my good kind brother i knew how it would be i knew he would manage everything how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her stay stay i will go myself ring the bell kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiners behaviour laid them all under for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents well i am so happy in a short time i shall have a daughter married mrs wickham how well it sounds and she was only sixteen last june my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you write for me we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted one days delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual other schemes too came into her head i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs long kitty run down and order the carriage an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do anything for you in meryton oh here comes hill my dear hill have you heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding mrs hill began instantly to express her joy elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained chapter 50 mr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him he now wished it more than ever had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brotherinlaw and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could when first mr bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son the son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he would this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands lydias expenses had been very little within that sum that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her the good news spread quickly through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farmhouse but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been downstairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance haye park might do said she if the gouldings could quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawingroom were larger but ashworth is too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for pulvis lodge the attics are dreadful her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm it soon led to another and mrs bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all she could believe possible she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters frailty would have mortified her so much not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them had lydias marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been most gladly and gratefully received he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal there must be a triumph she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgement information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother to mr bennets acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on and i think you will agree with me in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my nieces it is mr wickhams intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and your mother yours etc e gardiner mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do but mrs bennet was not so well pleased with it lydias being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody and had so many favourites she is so fond of mrs forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment his daughters request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north when mr bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes chapter 51 their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinnertime their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the culprit and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure they came the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them smiles decked the face of mrs bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness their reception from mr bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour there was no want of discourse the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i thought it would be very good fun if i was her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the people hereabouts know i am married today i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the sideglass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like anything elizabeth could bear it no longer she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first her ease and good spirits increased she longed to see mrs phillips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to mrs hill and the two housemaids well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband is not he a charming man i am sure my sisters must all envy me i only hope they may have half my good luck they must all go to brighton that is the place to get husbands what a pity it is mamma we did not all go very true and if i had my will we should but my dear lydia i dont at all like your going such a way off must it be so oh lord yes there is nothing in that i shall like it of all things you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all i should like it beyond anything said her mother and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them mr wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight no one but mrs bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydias for him she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion lydia was exceedingly fond of him he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him he did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than any body else in the country one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you curious to hear how it was managed no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said on the subject la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were married you know at st clements because wickhams lodgings were in that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven oclock my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if youll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight not one party or scheme or anything to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well mr darcy repeated elizabeth in utter amazement oh yes he was to come there with wickham you know but gracious me i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promised them so faithfully what will wickham say it was to be such a secret if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject you may depend upon my seeking no further oh certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information mr darcy had been at her sisters wedding it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante chapter 52 elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial gracechurch street sept 6 my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you dont think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor mr darcy called and was shut up with him several hours it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world his character was to speak for itself he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us there is a lady it seems a mrs younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what she then took a large house in edwardstreet and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings this mrs younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her at length however our kind friend procured the wishedfor direction they were in street he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the illconsequences of lydias flight on her own folly alone he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief they met several times for there was much to be discussed wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable every thing being settled between them mr darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home but mr gardiner could not be seen and mr darcy found on further inquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business on saturday he came again your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together they met again on sunday and then i saw him too it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn but our visitor was very obstinate i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys reserve can be answerable for the event but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish i believe i have now told you every thing it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by janes letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her mr darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name but slyness seems the fashion pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing but i must write no more the children have been wanting me this half hour yours very sincerely m gardiner the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem her heart did whisper that he had done it for her but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham brotherinlaw of wickham every kind of pride must revolt from the connection he had to be sure done much she was ashamed to think how much but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again it was hardly enough but it pleased her she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister said he as he joined her you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome i should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends and now we are better true are the others coming out i do not know mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley she replied in the affirmative i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose poor reynolds she was always very fond of me but of course she did not mention my name to you yes she did and what did she say that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well at such a distance as that you know things are strangely misrepresented certainly he replied biting his lips elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy in town last month we passed each other several times i wonder what he can be doing there perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year undoubtedly did you see him while you were at lambton i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had yes he introduced us to his sister and do you like her very much i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad you liked her i hope she will turn out well i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age did you go by the village of kympton i do not recollect that we did i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had a most delightful place excellent parsonage house it would have suited me in every respect how should you have liked making sermons exceedingly well i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness but it was not to be did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron you have yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember i did hear too that there was a time when sermonmaking was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly you did and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a goodhumoured smile come mr wickham we are brother and sister you know do not let us quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one mind she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house chapter 53 mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth oh my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again oh lord i dont know not these two or three years perhaps write to me very often my dear as often as i can but you know married women have never much time for writing my sisters may write to me they will have nothing else to do mr wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things he is as fine a fellow said mr bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends one seems so forlorn without them this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single it is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister for mrs phillips first brought her the news well so much the better not that i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it and who knows what may happen but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it and so is it quite certain he is coming you may depend on it replied the other for mrs nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she was going to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said i saw you look at me today lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed but dont imagine it was from any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other peoples remarks elizabeth did not know what to make of it had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation i will leave him to himself in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear said mrs bennet you will wait on him of course no no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand again his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield tis an etiquette i despise said he if he wants our society let him seek it he knows where we live i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before they did as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over i wish i could say anything to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much mr bingley arrived mrs bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressingroom window enter the paddock and ride towards the house her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window she looked she saw mr darcy with him and sat down again by her sister there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know la replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with him before mr whatshisname that tall proud man good gracious mr darcy and so it does i vow well any friend of mr bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter both sisters were uncomfortable enough each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingleys friend without being heard by either of them but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken but she would not be secure let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected on the gentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command she had ventured only one glance at darcy he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied darcy after inquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely anything he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so could i expect it to be otherwise said she yet why did he come she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak she inquired after his sister but could do no more it is a long time mr bingley since you went away said mrs bennet he readily agreed to it i began to be afraid you would never come back again people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of my own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said lately george wickham esq to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or anything it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it did you see it bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes how mr darcy looked therefore she could not tell it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars thank heaven he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present a few weeks he believed when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr bennets manor i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either one or the other again yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business they then went away mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year chapter 54 as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more mr darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither if he no longer cares for me why silent teasing teasing man i will think no more about him her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly oh jane take care my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hours visit had revived on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time when they repaired to the diningroom elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided he placed himself by her elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy with an expression of halflaughing alarm his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as showed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them he was on one side of her mother she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did her mothers ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind and she would at times have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawingroom before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for ever the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair and on the gentlemens approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men shant come and part us i am determined we want none of them do we darcy had walked away to another part of the room she followed him with her eyes envied everyone to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still yes she will remain there till christmas and quite alone have all her friends left her mrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young ladys whispering to elizabeth again he walked away when the teathings were removed and the cardtables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party she now lost every expectation of pleasure they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucases last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and what do you think she said besides ah mrs bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we may often meet again elizabeth smiled lizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment how hard it is in some cases to be believed and how impossible in others but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge that is a question which i hardly know how to answer we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante chapter 55 a few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits mrs bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky he should be particularly happy at any time etc etc and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them can you come tomorrow yes he had no engagement at all for tomorrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed in ran mrs bennet to her daughters room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make haste and hurry down he is come mr bingley is come he is indeed make haste make haste here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown never mind miss lizzys hair we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago oh hang kitty what has she to do with it come be quick be quick where is your sash my dear but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening after tea mr bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma what do you keep winking at me for what am i to do nothing child nothing i did not wink at you she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her entreaty that she would not give in to it in a few minutes mrs bennet halfopened the door and called out lizzy my dear i want to speak with you elizabeth was forced to go we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall kitty and i are going up stairs to sit in my dressingroom elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawingroom mrs bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband after this day jane said no more of her indifference not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy returned within the stated time seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans concurrence bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs bennets invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes but on returning to the drawingroom when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all their situation was awkward enough but hers she thought was still worse not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world tis too much she added by far too much i do not deserve it oh why is not everybody as happy elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present i must go instantly to my mother she cried i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself he is gone to my father already oh lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family how shall i bear so much happiness she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest most reasonable end in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose where is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door with my mother up stairs she will be down in a moment i dare say he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon mrs bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of your doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income i hope not so imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me exceed their income my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more then addressing her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen wickham lydia were all forgotten jane was beyond competition her favourite child at that moment she cared for no other her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not believed it possible i suspected as much replied elizabeth but how did he account for it it must have been his sisters doing they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried jane oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man for you if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs phillips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune chapter 56 one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the diningroom their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered it was lady catherine de bourgh they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of introduction had been made mrs bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet that lady i suppose is your mother elizabeth replied very concisely that she was and that i suppose is one of your sisters yes madam said mrs bennet delighted to speak to lady catherine she is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well yes very well i saw them the night before last elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating anything and then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company go my dear cried her mother and show her ladyship about the different walks i think she will be pleased with the hermitage elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest downstairs as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and drawingroom and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waitingwoman was in it they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable how could i ever think her like her nephew said she as she looked in her face as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment indeed you are mistaken madam i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far what could your ladyship propose by it at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence if do you then pretend to be ignorant of it has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves do you not know that such a report is spread abroad i never heard that it was and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer this is not to be borne miss bennet i insist on being satisfied has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage your ladyship has declared it to be impossible it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family you may have drawn him in if i have i shall be the last person to confess it miss bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such language as this i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit let me be rightly understood this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place no never mr darcy is engaged to my daughter now what have you to say only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind from their infancy they have been intended for each other it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of hers while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage its completion depended on others if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice and if i am that choice why may not i accept him because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all you will be censured slighted and despised by everyone connected with him your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine obstinate headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that score let us sit down you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it i have not been used to submit to any persons whims i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment that will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the fathers from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families their fortune on both sides is splendid they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere he is a gentleman i am a gentlemans daughter so far we are equal true you are a gentlemans daughter but who was your mother who are your uncles and aunts do not imagine me ignorant of their condition whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you tell me once for all are you engaged to him though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moments deliberation i am not lady catherine seemed pleased and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement i will make no promise of the kind miss bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more reasonable young woman but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require and i certainly never shall give it i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make their marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was illjudged you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject not so hasty if you please i have by no means done to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a patchedup business at the expence of your father and uncles and is such a girl to be my nephews sister is her husband is the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother heaven and earth of what are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted you can now have nothing further to say she resentfully answered you have insulted me in every possible method i must beg to return to the house and she rose as she spoke lady catherine rose also and they turned back her ladyship was highly incensed you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody lady catherine i have nothing further to say you know my sentiments you are then resolved to have him i have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me it is well you refuse then to oblige me you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i shall now know how to act do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet i send no compliments to your mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself she did not choose it said her daughter she would go she is a very finelooking woman and her calling here was prodigiously civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible chapter 57 the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy it was a rational scheme to be sure but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply the idea she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him in that case he would return no more lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs bennets curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject the next morning as she was going downstairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony let me congratulate you on a very important conquest the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer this letter is from mr collins from mr collins and what can he have to say something very much to the purpose of course he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the goodnatured gossiping lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point what relates to yourself is as follows having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentlemans proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is but now it comes out my motive for cautioning you is as follows we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye mr darcy you see is the man now lizzy i think i have surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related mr darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life it is admirable elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her are you not diverted oh yes pray read on after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned mr collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing that is his notion of christian forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes situation and his expectation of a young olivebranch but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn oh cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted but it is so strange yes that is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr collinss correspondence for any consideration nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my soninlaw and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report did she call to refuse her consent to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr darcys indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much chapter 58 instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines visit the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out it was agreed to mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted you must not blame my aunt lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable they walked on without knowing in what direction there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it darcy mentioned his letter did it said he did it soon make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of innocence but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased had you then persuaded yourself that i should indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after that evening hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley you blamed me for coming no indeed i felt nothing but surprise your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due my object then replied darcy was to show you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know anything about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home what could become of mr bingley and jane was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it i must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made here and i was convinced of her affection and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sisters sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at and it was rather too early to begin in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house in the hall they parted chapter 59 my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered their room and from all the others when they sat down to table she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor anything else awakened a suspicion of the truth the evening passed quietly unmarked by anything extraordinary the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away at night she opened her heart to jane though suspicion was very far from miss bennets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here you are joking lizzy this cannot be engaged to mr darcy no no you shall not deceive me i know it to be impossible this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are engaged jane looked at her doubtingly oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much you dislike him you know nothing of the matter that is all to be forgot perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself miss bennet still looked all amazement elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried jane my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certain forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world but are you pleased jane shall you like to have such a brother very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you really love him quite well enough oh lizzy do anything rather than marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all what do you mean why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am afraid you will be angry my dearest sister now be serious i want to talk very seriously let me know every thing that i am to know without delay will you tell me how long you have loved him it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley another entreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing further to wish now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself i always had a value for him were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingleys friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton i owe all that i know of it to another not to you elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydias marriage all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation good gracious cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here i had no notion but he would go ashooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company what shall we do with him lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys way elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud mrs bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today i advise mr darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has never seen the view it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty kitty owned that she had rather stay at home darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented as she went up stairs to get ready mrs bennet followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then so do not put yourself to inconvenience during their walk it was resolved that mr bennets consent should be asked in the course of the evening elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation in the evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme she did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library she was gone directly her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious lizzy said he what are you doing are you out of your senses to be accepting this man have not you always hated him how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr darcy or in other words you are determined to have him he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane but will they make you happy have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference none at all we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms lizzy said her father i have given him my consent he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse anything which he condescended to ask i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him but let me advise you to think better of it i know your disposition lizzy i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage you could scarcely escape discredit and misery my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life you know not what you are about elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say if this be the case he deserves you i could not have parted with you my lizzy to anyone less worthy to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia he heard her with astonishment this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellows debts and got him his commission so much the better it will save me a world of trouble and economy had it been your uncles doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way i shall offer to pay him tomorrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr collinss letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer anything material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her and made the important communication its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself good gracious lord bless me only think dear me mr darcy who would have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest lizzy how rich and how great you will be what pinmoney what jewels what carriages you will have janes is nothing to it nothing at all i am so pleased so happy such a charming man so handsome so tall oh my dear lizzy pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before i hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town every thing that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh lord what will become of me i shall go distracted this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else ten thousand a year and very likely more tis as good as a lord and a special licence you must and shall be married by a special licence but my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it tomorrow this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended soninlaw that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem i admire all my three sonsinlaw highly said he wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as janes chapter 60 elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her how could you begin said she i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence for the liveliness of your mind i did you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement but i was embarrassed and so was i you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner a man who had felt less might how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours my aunts intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequence my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her i am more likely to want more time than courage elizabeth but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been overrated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiners long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write you supposed more than really existed but now suppose as much as you choose give a loose rein to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes how could i be so silly as to wish it your idea of the ponies is delightful we will go round the park every day i am the happiest creature in the world perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh mr darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me you are all to come to pemberley at christmas yours etc mr darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr bennet sent to mr collins in reply to his last dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darcy console lady catherine as well as you can but if i were you i would stand by the nephew he has more to give yours sincerely etc miss bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brothers in sending it four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister before any answer could arrive from mr collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband he bore it however with admirable calmness he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st jamess with very decent composure if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight mrs phillipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs phillips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley chapter 61 happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable wellinformed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid from the further disadvantage of lydias society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennets being quite unable to sit alone mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr darcy about it if you had rather not yours etc as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought his affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeths sake he assisted him further in his profession lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingleys good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see they were able to love each other even as well as they intended georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way by elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end but at length by elizabeths persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them end of this project gutenberg ebook pride and

toms liberality the end yours truly huck finn illustration the widows the adventures of huckleberry finn chapter i you dont know about me without you have read a book by the name of the adventures of tom sawyer but that aint no matter that book was made by mr mark twain and he told the truth mainly there was things which he stretched but mainly he told the truth that is nothing i never seen anybody but lied one time or another without it was aunt polly or the widow or maybe mary aunt pollytoms aunt polly she isand mary and the widow douglas is all told about in that book which is mostly a true book with some stretchers as i said before now the way that the book winds up is this tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave and it made us rich we got six thousand dollars apieceall gold it was an awful sight of money when it was piled up well judge thatcher he took it and put it out at interest and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year roundmore than a body could tell what to do with the widow douglas she took me for her son and allowed she would sivilize me but it was rough living in the house all the time considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways and so when i couldnt stand it no longer i lit out i got into my old rags and my sugarhogshead again and was free and satisfied but tom sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers and i might join if i would go back to the widow and be respectable so i went back the widow she cried over me and called me a poor lost lamb and she called me a lot of other names too but she never meant no harm by it she put me in them new clothes again and i couldnt do nothing but sweat and sweat and feel all cramped up well then the old thing commenced again the widow rung a bell for supper and you had to come to time when you got to the table you couldnt go right to eating but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals though there warnt really anything the matter with themthat is nothing only everything was cooked by itself in a barrel of odds and ends it is different things get mixed up and the juice kind of swaps around and the things go better after supper she got out her book and learned me about moses and the bulrushers and i was in a sweat to find out all about him but by and by she let it out that moses had been dead a considerable long time so then i didnt care no more about him because i dont take no stock in dead people illustration learning about moses and the bulrushers pretty soon i wanted to smoke and asked the widow to let me but she wouldnt she said it was a mean practice and wasnt clean and i must try to not do it any more that is just the way with some people they get down on a thing when they dont know nothing about it here she was abothering about moses which was no kin to her and no use to anybody being gone you see yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it and she took snuff too of course that was all right because she done it herself her sister miss watson a tolerable slim old maid with goggles on had just come to live with her and took a set at me now with a spelling book she worked me middling hard for about an hour and then the widow made her ease up i couldnt stood it much longer then for an hour it was deadly dull and i was fidgety miss watson would say dont put your feet up there huckleberry and dont scrunch up like that huckleberryset up straight and pretty soon she would say dont gap and stretch like that huckleberrywhy dont you try to behave then she told me all about the bad place and i said i wished i was there she got mad then but i didnt mean no harm all i wanted was to go somewheres all i wanted was a change i warnt particular she said it was wicked to say what i said said she wouldnt say it for the whole world she was going to live so as to go to the good place well i couldnt see no advantage in going where she was going so i made up my mind i wouldnt try for it but i never said so because it would only make trouble and wouldnt do no good illustration miss watson now she had got a start and she went on and told me all about the good place she said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing forever and ever so i didnt think much of it but i never said so i asked her if she reckoned tom sawyer would go there and she said not by a considerable sight i was glad about that because i wanted him and me to be together miss watson she kept pecking at me and it got tiresome and lonesome by and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers and then everybody was off to bed i went up to my room with a piece of candle and put it on the table then i set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful but it warnt no use i felt so lonesome i most wished i was dead the stars were shining and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful and i heard an owl away off whowhooing about somebody that was dead and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die and the wind was trying to whisper something to me and i couldnt make out what it was and so it made the cold shivers run over me then away out in the woods i heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something thats on its mind and cant make itself understood and so cant rest easy in its grave and has to go about that way every night grieving i got so downhearted and scared i did wish i had some company pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder and i flipped it off and it lit in the candle and before i could budge it was all shriveled up i didnt need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck so i was scared and most shook the clothes off of me i got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time and then i tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away but i hadnt no confidence you do that when youve lost a horseshoe that youve found instead of nailing it up over the door but i hadnt ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when youd killed a spider i set down again ashaking all over and got out my pipe for a smoke for the house was all as still as death now and so the widow wouldnt know well after a long time i heard the clock away off in the town go boomboomboomtwelve licks and all still againstiller than ever pretty soon i heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the treessomething was a stirring i set still and listened directly i could just barely hear a meyow meyow down there that was good says i meyow meyow as soft as i could and then i put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed then i slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees and sure enough there was tom sawyer waiting for me illustration huck stealing away illustration they tiptoed along chapter ii we went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widows garden stooping down so as the branches wouldnt scrape our heads when we was passing by the kitchen i fell over a root and made a noise we scrouched down and laid still miss watsons big nigger named jim was setting in the kitchen door we could see him pretty clear because there was a light behind him he got up and stretched his neck out about a minute listening then he says who dah he listened some more then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us we could a touched him nearly well likely it was minutes and minutes that there warnt a sound and we all there so close together there was a place on my ankle that got to itching but i dasnt scratch it and then my ear begun to itch and next my back right between my shoulders seemed like id die if i couldnt scratch well ive noticed that thing plenty times since if you are with the quality or at a funeral or trying to go to sleep when you aint sleepyif you are anywheres where it wont do for you to scratch why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places pretty soon jim says say who is you whar is you dog my cats ef i didn hear sumfn well i know what is gwyne to do is gwyne to set down here and listen tell i hears it agin illustration jim so he set down on the ground betwixt me and tom he leaned his back up against a tree and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine my nose begun to itch it itched till the tears come into my eyes but i dasnt scratch then it begun to itch on the inside next i got to itching underneath i didnt know how i was going to set still this miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes but it seemed a sight longer than that i was itching in eleven different places now i reckoned i couldnt stand it moren a minute longer but i set my teeth hard and got ready to try just then jim begun to breathe heavy next he begun to snoreand then i was pretty soon comfortable again tom he made a sign to mekind of a little noise with his mouthand we went creeping away on our hands and knees when we was ten foot off tom whispered to me and wanted to tie jim to the tree for fun but i said no he might wake and make a disturbance and then theyd find out i warnt in then tom said he hadnt got candles enough and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more i didnt want him to try i said jim might wake up and come but tom wanted to resk it so we slid in there and got three candles and tom laid five cents on the table for pay then we got out and i was in a sweat to get away but nothing would do tom but he must crawl to where jim was on his hands and knees and play something on him i waited and it seemed a good while everything was so still and lonesome as soon as tom was back we cut along the path around the garden fence and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house tom said he slipped jims hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him and jim stirred a little but he didnt wake afterwards jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance and rode him all over the state and then set him under the trees again and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it and next time jim told it he said they rode him down to new orleans and after that every time he told it he spread it more and more till by and by he said they rode him all over the world and tired him most to death and his back was all over saddleboils jim was monstrous proud about it and he got so he wouldnt hardly notice the other niggers niggers would come miles to hear jim tell about it and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over same as if he was a wonder niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things jim would happen in and say hm what you know bout witches and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat jim always kept that fivecenter piece round his neck with a string and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it but he never told what it was he said to it niggers would come from all around there and give jim anything they had just for a sight of that fivecenter piece but they wouldnt touch it because the devil had had his hands on it jim was most ruined for a servant because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches well when tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling where there was sick folks maybe and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine and down by the village was the river a whole mile broad and awful still and grand we went down the hill and found jo harper and ben rogers and two or three more of the boys hid in the old tanyard so we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half to the big scar on the hillside and went ashore we went to a clump of bushes and tom made everybody swear to keep the secret and then showed them a hole in the hill right in the thickest part of the bushes then we lit the candles and crawled in on our hands and knees we went about two hundred yards and then the cave opened up tom poked about amongst the passages and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldnt a noticed that there was a hole we went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room all damp and sweaty and cold and there we stopped tom says now well start this band of robbers and call it tom sawyers gang everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath and write his name in blood illustration tom sawyers band of robbers everybody was willing so tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on and read it it swore every boy to stick to the band and never tell any of the secrets and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it and he mustnt eat and he mustnt sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts which was the sign of the band and nobody that didnt belong to the band could use that mark and if he did he must be sued and if he done it again he must be killed and if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets he must have his throat cut and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever everybody said it was a real beautiful oath and asked tom if he got it out of his own head he said some of it but the rest was out of piratebooks and robberbooks and every gang that was hightoned had it some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that told the secrets tom said it was a good idea so he took a pencil and wrote it in then ben rogers says heres huck finn he haint got no family what you going to do bout him well haint he got a father says tom sawyer yes hes got a father but you cant never find him these days he used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard but he haint been seen in these parts for a year or more they talked it over and they was going to rule me out because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill or else it wouldnt be fair and square for the others well nobody could think of anything to doeverybody was stumped and set still i was most ready to cry but all at once i thought of a way and so i offered them miss watsonthey could kill her everybody said oh shell do thats all right huck can come in then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with and i made my mark on the paper now says ben rogers whats the line of business of this gang nothing only robbery and murder tom said but who are we going to robhouses or cattle or stuff stealing cattle and such things aint robbery its burglary says tom sawyer we aint burglars that aint no sort of style we are highwaymen we stop stages and carriages on the road with masks on and kill the people and take their watches and money must we always kill the people oh certainly its best some authorities think different but mostly its considered best to kill themexcept some that you bring to the cave here and keep them till theyre ransomed ransomed whats that i dont know but thats what they do ive seen it in books and so of course thats what weve got to do but how can we do it if we dont know what it is why blame it all weve got to do it dont i tell you its in the books do you want to go to doing different from whats in the books and get things all muddled up oh thats all very fine to say tom sawyer but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we dont know how to do it to themthats the thing i want to get at now what do you reckon it is well i dont know but peraps if we keep them till theyre ransomed it means that we keep them till theyre dead now thats something like thatll answer why couldnt you said that before well keep them till theyre ransomed to death and a bothersome lot theyll be tooeating up everything and always trying to get loose how you talk ben rogers how can they get loose when theres a guard over them ready to shoot them down if they move a peg a guard well that is good so somebodys got to set up all night and never get any sleep just so as to watch them i think thats foolishness why cant a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here because it aint in the books sothats why now ben rogers do you want to do things regular or dont youthats the idea dont you reckon that the people that made the books knows whats the correct thing to do do you reckon you can learn em anything not by a good deal no sir well just go on and ransom them in the regular way all right i dont mind but i say its a fool way anyhow say do we kill the women too well ben rogers if i was as ignorant as you i wouldnt let on kill the women no nobody ever saw anything in the books like that you fetch them to the cave and youre always as polite as pie to them and by and by they fall in love with you and never want to go home any more well if thats the way im agreed but i dont take no stock in it mighty soon well have the cave so cluttered up with women and fellows waiting to be ransomed that there wont be no place for the robbers but go ahead i aint got nothing to say little tommy barnes was asleep now and when they waked him up he was scared and cried and said he wanted to go home to his ma and didnt want to be a robber any more so they all made fun of him and called him crybaby and that made him mad and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets but tom give him five cents to keep quiet and said we would all go home and meet next week and rob somebody and kill some people ben rogers said he couldnt get out much only sundays and so he wanted to begin next sunday but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on sunday and that settled the thing they agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could and then we elected tom sawyer first captain and jo harper second captain of the gang and so started home i clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking my new clothes was all greased up and clayey and i was dog tired illustration huck creeps into his window illustration miss watsons lecture chapter iii well i got a good goingover in the morning from old miss watson on account of my clothes but the widow she didnt scold but only cleaned off the grease and clay and looked so sorry that i thought i would behave awhile if i could then miss watson she took me in the closet and prayed but nothing come of it she told me to pray every day and whatever i asked for i would get it but it warnt so i tried it once i got a fishline but no hooks it warnt any good to me without hooks i tried for the hooks three or four times but somehow i couldnt make it work by and by one day i asked miss watson to try for me but she said i was a fool she never told me why and i couldnt make it out no way i set down one time back in the woods and had a long think about it i says to myself if a body can get anything they pray for why dont deacon winn get back the money he lost on pork why cant the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole why cant miss watson fat up no says i to my self there aint nothing in it i went and told the widow about it and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was spiritual gifts this was too many for me but she told me what she meanti must help other people and do everything i could for other people and look out for them all the time and never think about myself this was including miss watson as i took it i went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time but i couldnt see no advantage about itexcept for the other people so at last i reckoned i wouldnt worry about it any more but just let it go sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about providence in a way to make a bodys mouth water but maybe next day miss watson would take hold and knock it all down again i judged i could see that there was two providences and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widows providence but if miss watsons got him there warnt no help for him any more i thought it all out and reckoned i would belong to the widows if he wanted me though i couldnt make out how he was agoing to be any better off then than what he was before seeing i was so ignorant and so kind of lowdown and ornery pap he hadnt been seen for more than a year and that was comfortable for me i didnt want to see him no more he used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me though i used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around well about this time he was found in the river drownded about twelve mile above town so people said they judged it was him anyway said this drownded man was just his size and was ragged and had uncommon long hair which was all like pap but they couldnt make nothing out of the face because it had been in the water so long it warnt much like a face at all they said he was floating on his back in the water they took him and buried him on the bank but i warnt comfortable long because i happened to think of something i knowed mighty well that a drownded man dont float on his back but on his face so i knowed then that this warnt pap but a woman dressed up in a mans clothes so i was uncomfortable again i judged the old man would turn up again by and by though i wished he wouldnt we played robber now and then about a month and then i resigned all the boys did we hadnt robbed nobody hadnt killed any people but only just pretended we used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hogdrivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market but we never hived any of them tom sawyer called the hogs ingots and he called the turnips and stuff julery and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done and how many people we had killed and marked but i couldnt see no profit in it one time tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick which he called a slogan which was the sign for the gang to get together and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of spanish merchants and rich arabs was going to camp in cave hollow with two hundred elephants and six hundred camels and over a thousand sumter mules all loaded down with dimonds and they didnt have only a guard of four hundred soldiers and so we would lay in ambuscade as he called it and kill the lot and scoop the things he said we must slick up our swords and guns and get ready he never could go after even a turnip cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it though they was only lath and broomsticks and you might scour at them till you rotted and then they warnt worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before i didnt believe we could lick such a crowd of spaniards and arabs but i wanted to see the camels and elephants so i was on hand next day saturday in the ambuscade and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill but there warnt no spaniards and arabs and there warnt no camels nor no elephants it warnt anything but a sundayschool picnic and only a primerclass at that we busted it up and chased the children up the hollow but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam though ben rogers got a rag doll and jo harper got a hymnbook and a tract and then the teacher charged in and made us drop everything and cut illustration the robbers dispersed i didnt see no dimonds and i told tom sawyer so he said there was loads of them there anyway and he said there was arabs there too and elephants and things i said why couldnt we see them then he said if i warnt so ignorant but had read a book called don quixote i would know without asking he said it was all done by enchantment he said there was hundreds of soldiers there and elephants and treasure and so on but we had enemies which he called magicians and they had turned the whole thing into an infant sundayschool just out of spite i said all right then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians tom sawyer said i was a numskull why said he a magician could call up a lot of genies and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say jack robinson they are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church well i says spose we got some genies to help uscant we lick the other crowd then how you going to get them i dont know how do they get them why they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring and then the genies come tearing in with the thunder and lightning aripping around and the smoke arolling and everything theyre told to do they up and do it they dont think nothing of pulling a shottower up by the roots and belting a sundayschool superintendent over the head with itor any other man who makes them tear around so why whoever rubs the lamp or the ring they belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring and theyve got to do whatever he says if he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of dimonds and fill it full of chewinggum or whatever you want and fetch an emperors daughter from china for you to marry theyve got to do itand theyve got to do it before sunup next morning too and more theyve got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it you understand well says i i think they are a pack of flatheads for not keeping the palace themselves stead of fooling them away like that and whats moreif i was one of them i would see a man in jericho before i would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp how you talk huck finn why youd have to come when he rubbed it whether you wanted to or not what and i as high as a tree and as big as a church all right then i would come but i lay id make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country shucks it aint no use to talk to you huck finn you dont seem to know anything somehowperfect saphead i thought all this over for two or three days and then i reckoned i would see if there was anything in it i got an old tin lamp and an iron ring and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till i sweat like an injun calculating to build a palace and sell it but it warnt no use none of the genies come so then i judged that all that stuff was only just one of tom sawyers lies i reckoned he believed in the arabs and the elephants but as for me i think different it had all the marks of a sundayschool illustration rubbing the lamp illustration chapter iv well three or four months run along and it was well into the winter now i had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirtyfive and i dont reckon i could ever get any further than that if i was to live forever i dont take no stock in mathematics anyway at first i hated the school but by and by i got so i could stand it whenever i got uncommon tired i played hookey and the hiding i got next day done me good and cheered me up so the longer i went to school the easier it got to be i was getting sort of used to the widows ways too and they warnt so raspy on me living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly but before the cold weather i used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes and so that was a rest to me i liked the old ways best but i was getting so i liked the new ones too a little bit the widow said i was coming along slow but sure and doing very satisfactory she said she warnt ashamed of me one morning i happened to turn over the saltcellar at breakfast i reached for some of it as quick as i could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck but miss watson was in ahead of me and crossed me off she says take your hands away huckleberry what a mess you are always making the widow put in a good word for me but that warnt going to keep off the bad luck i knowed that well enough i started out after breakfast feeling worried and shaky and wondering where it was going to fall on me and what it was going to be there is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck but this wasnt one of them kind so i never tried to do anything but just poked along lowspirited and on the watchout i went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence there was an inch of new snow on the ground and i seen somebodys tracks they had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while and then went on around the garden fence it was funny they hadnt come in after standing around so i couldnt make it out it was very curious somehow i was going to follow around but i stooped down to look at the tracks first i didnt notice anything at first but next i did there was a cross in the left bootheel made with big nails to keep off the devil i was up in a second and shinning down the hill i looked over my shoulder every now and then but i didnt see nobody i was at judge thatchers as quick as i could get there he said why my boy you are all out of breath did you come for your interest no sir i says is there some for me oh yes a halfyearly is in last nightover a hundred and fifty dollars quite a fortune for you you had better let me invest it along with your six thousand because if you take it youll spend it no sir i says i dont want to spend it i dont want it at allnor the six thousand nuther i want you to take it i want to give it to youthe six thousand and all illustration judge thatcher surprised he looked surprised he couldnt seem to make it out he says why what can you mean my boy i says dont you ask me no questions about it please youll take itwont you he says well im puzzled is something the matter please take it says i and dont ask me nothingthen i wont have to tell no lies he studied a while and then he says ohoo i think i see you want to sell all your property to menot give it thats the correct idea then he wrote something on a paper and read it over and says there you see it says for a consideration that means i have bought it of you and paid you for it heres a dollar for you now you sign it so i signed it and left miss watsons nigger jim had a hairball as big as your fist which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox and he used to do magic with it he said there was a spirit inside of it and it knowed everything so i went to him that night and told him pap was here again for i found his tracks in the snow what i wanted to know was what he was going to do and was he going to stay jim got out his hairball and said something over it and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor it fell pretty solid and only rolled about an inch jim tried it again and then another time and it acted just the same jim got down on his knees and put his ear against it and listened but it warnt no use he said it wouldnt talk he said sometimes it wouldnt talk without money i told him i had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warnt no good because the brass showed through the silver a little and it wouldnt pass nohow even if the brass didnt show because it was so slick it felt greasy and so that would tell on it every time i reckoned i wouldnt say nothing about the dollar i got from the judge i said it was pretty bad money but maybe the hairball would take it because maybe it wouldnt know the difference jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it and said he would manage so the hairball would think it was good he said he would split open a raw irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night and next morning you couldnt see no brass and it wouldnt feel greasy no more and so anybody in town would take it in a minute let alone a hairball well i knowed a potato would do that before but i had forgot it illustration jim listening jim put the quarter under the hairball and got down and listened again this time he said the hairball was all right he said it would tell my whole fortune if i wanted it to i says go on so the hair ball talked to jim and jim told it to me he says yo ole father doan know yit what hes agwyne to do sometimes he spec hell go way en den agin he spec hell stay de bes way is to res easy en let de ole man take his own way deys two

minute i see i was mistakenthat is after the first jolt as you may say when my breath sort of hitched he being so unexpected but right away after i see i warnt scared of him worth bothring about he

mustnt interfere and separate families if they could help it said hed druther not take a child away from its father so judge thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business that pleased the old man till he couldnt rest he said hed cowhide me till i was black and blue if i didnt raise some money for him i borrowed three dollars from judge thatcher and pap took it and got drunk and went ablowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on and he kept it up all over town with a tin pan till most midnight then they jailed him and next day they had him before court and jailed him again for a week but he said he was satisfied said he was boss of his son and hed make it warm for him when he got out the new judge said he was agoing to make a man of him so he took him to his own house and dressed him up clean and nice and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family and was just old pie to him so to speak and after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried and said hed been a fool and fooled away his life but now he was agoing to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldnt be ashamed of and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him the judge said he could hug him for them words so he cried and his wife she cried again pap said hed been a man that had always been misunderstood before and the judge said he believed it the old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy and the judge said it was so so they cried again and when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand and says look at it gentlemen and ladies all take ahold of it shake it theres a hand that was the hand of a hog but it aint so no more its the hand of a man thats started in on a new life andll die before hell go back you mark them wordsdont forget i said them its a clean hand now shake itdont be afeard illustration reforming the drunkard so they shook it one after the other all around and cried the judges wife she kissed it then the old man he signed a pledgemade his mark the judge said it was the holiest time on record or something like that then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room which was the spare room and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porchroof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of fortyrod and clumb back again and had a good old time and towards daylight he crawled out again drunk as a fiddler and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sunup and when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it the judge he felt kind of sore he said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun maybe but he didnt know no other way illustration falling from grace illustration getting out of the way chapter vi well pretty soon the old man was up and around again and then he went for judge thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money and he went for me too for not stopping school he catched me a couple of times and thrashed me but i went to school just the same and dodged him or outrun him most of the time i didnt want to go to school much before but i reckoned id go now to spite pap that law trial was a slow businessappeared like they warnt ever going to get started on it so every now and then id borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him to keep from getting a cowhiding every time he got money he got drunk and every time he got drunk he raised cain around town and every time he raised cain he got jailed he was just suitedthis kind of thing was right in his line he got to hanging around the widows too much and so she told him at last that if he didnt quit using around there she would make trouble for him well wasnt he mad he said he would show who was huck finns boss so he watched out for me one day in the spring and catched me and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff and crossed over to the illinois shore where it was woody and there warnt no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldnt find it if you didnt know where it was he kept me with him all the time and i never got a chance to run off we lived in that old cabin and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights he had a gun which he had stole i reckon and we fished and hunted and that was what we lived on every little while he locked me in and went down to the store three miles to the ferry and traded fish and game for whisky and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time and licked me the widow she found out where i was by and by and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me but pap drove him off with the gun and it warnt long after that till i was used to being where i was and liked itall but the cowhide part it was kind of lazy and jolly laying off comfortable all day smoking and fishing and no books nor study two months or more run along and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt and i didnt see how id ever got to like it so well at the widows where you had to wash and eat on a plate and comb up and go to bed and get up regular and be forever bothering over a book and have old miss watson pecking at you all the time i didnt want to go back no more i had stopped cussing because the widow didnt like it but now i took to it again because pap hadnt no objections it was pretty good times up in the woods there take it all around illustration solid comfort but by and by pap got too handy with his hickry and i couldnt stand it i was all over welts he got to going away so much too and locking me in once he locked me in and was gone three days it was dreadful lonesome i judged he had got drownded and i wasnt ever going to get out any more i was scared i made up my mind i would fix up some way to leave there i had tried to get out of that cabin many a time but i couldnt find no way there warnt a window to it big enough for a dog to get through i couldnt get up the chimbly it was too narrow the door was thick solid oak slabs pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away i reckon i had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times well i was most all the time at it because it was about the only way to put in the time but this time i found something at last i found an old rusty woodsaw without any handle it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof i greased it up and went to work there was an old horseblanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out i got under the table and raised the blanket and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log outbig enough to let me through well it was a good long job but i was getting towards the end of it when i heard paps gun in the woods i got rid of the signs of my work and dropped the blanket and hid my saw and pretty soon pap come in pap warnt in a good humorso he was his natural self he said he was down town and everything was going wrong his lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial but then there was ways to put it off a long time and judge thatcher knowed how to do it and he said people allowed thered be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian and they guessed it would win this time this shook me up considerable because i didnt want to go back to the widows any more and be so cramped up and sivilized as they called it then the old man got to cussing and cussed everything and everybody he could think of and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadnt skipped any and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round including a considerable parcel of people which he didnt know the names of and so called them whatshisname when he got to them and went right along with his cussing he said he would like to see the widow get me he said he would watch out and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldnt find me that made me pretty uneasy again but only for a minute i reckoned i wouldnt stay on hand till he got that chance the old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got there was a fiftypound sack of corn meal and a side of bacon ammunition and a fourgallon jug of whisky and an old book and two newspapers for wadding besides some tow i toted up a load and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest i thought it all over and i reckoned i would walk off with the gun and some lines and take to the woods when i run away i guessed i wouldnt stay in one place but just tramp right across the country mostly night times and hunt and fish to keep alive and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldnt ever find me any more i judged i would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough and i reckoned he would i got so full of it i didnt notice how long i was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether i was asleep or drownded illustration thinking it over i got the things all up to the cabin and then it was about dark while i was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up and went to ripping again he had been drunk over in town and laid in the gutter all night and he was a sight to look at a body would a thought he was adamhe was just all mud whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment this time he says call this a govment why just look at it and see what its like heres the law astanding ready to take a mans son away from hima mans own son which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising yes just as that man has got that son raised at last and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin for him and give him a rest the law up and goes for him and they call that govment that aint all nuther the law backs that old judge thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o my property heres what the law does the law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and upards and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this and lets him go round in clothes that aint fitten for a hog they call that govment a man cant get his rights in a govment like this sometimes ive a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all yes and i told em so i told old thatcher so to his face lots of em heard me and can tell what i said says i for two cents id leave the blamed country and never come anear it agin thems the very words i says look at my hatif you call it a hatbut the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till its below my chin and then it aint rightly a hat at all but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o stovepipe look at it says isuch a hat for me to wearone of the wealthiest men in this town if i could git my rights oh yes this is a wonderful govment wonderful why looky here there was a free nigger there from ohioa mulatter most as white as a white man he had the whitest shirt on you ever see too and the shiniest hat and there aint a man in that town thats got as fine clothes as what he had and he had a gold watch and chain and a silver headed canethe awfulest old grayheaded nabob in the state and what do you think they said he was a pfessor in a college and could talk all kinds of languages and knowed everything and that aint the wust they said he could vote when he was at home well that let me out thinks i what is the country acoming to it was lection day and i was just about to go and vote myself if i warnt too drunk to get there but when they told me there was a state in this country where theyd let that nigger vote i drawed out i says ill never vote agin thems the very words i said they all heard me and the country may rot for all meill never vote agin as long as i live and to see the cool way of that niggerwhy he wouldnt a give me the road if i hadnt shoved him out o the way i says to the people why aint this nigger put up at auction and soldthats what i want to know and what do you reckon they said why they said he couldnt be sold till hed been in the state six months and he hadnt been there that long yet there nowthats a specimen they call that a govment that cant sell a free nigger till hes been in the state six months heres a govment that calls itself a govment and lets on to be a govment and thinks it is a govment and yets got to set stockstill for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling thieving infernal whiteshirted free nigger and pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of languagemostly hove at the nigger and the govment though he give the tub some too all along here and there he hopped around the cabin considerable first on one leg and then on the other holding first one shin and then the other one and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick but it warnt good judgment because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it so now he raised a howl that fairly made a bodys hair raise and down he went in the dirt and rolled there and held his toes and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous he said so his own self afterwards he had heard old sowberry hagan in his best days and he said it laid over him too but i reckon that was sort of piling it on maybe after supper pap took the jug and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens that was always his word i judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour and then i would steal the key or saw myself out one or tother he drank and drank and tumbled down on his blankets by and by but luck didnt run my way he didnt go sound asleep but was uneasy he groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time at last i got so sleepy i couldnt keep my eyes open all i could do and so before i knowed what i was about i was sound asleep and the candle burning illustration raising a howl i dont know how long i was asleep but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and i was up there was pap looking wild and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes he said they was crawling up his legs and then he would give a jump and scream and say one had bit him on the cheekbut i couldnt see no snakes he started and run round and round the cabin hollering take him off take him off hes biting me on the neck i never see a man look so wild in the eyes pretty soon he was all fagged out and fell down panting then he rolled over and over wonderful fast kicking things every which way and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands and screaming and saying there was devils ahold of him he wore out by and by and laid still a while moaning then he laid stiller and didnt make a sound i could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods and it seemed terrible still he was laying over by the corner by and by he raised up part way and listened with his head to one side he says very low tramptramptramp thats the dead tramptramptramp theyre coming after me but i wont go oh theyre here dont touch medont hands offtheyre cold let go oh let a poor devil alone then he went down on all fours and crawled off begging them to let him alone and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table still abegging and then he went to crying i could hear him through the blanket by and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild and he see me and went for me he chased me round and round the place with a claspknife calling me the angel of death and saying he would kill me and then i couldnt come for him no more i begged and told him i was only huck but he laughed such a screechy laugh and roared and cussed and kept on chasing me up once when i turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders and i thought i was gone but i slid out of the jacket quick as lightning and saved myself pretty soon he was all tired out and dropped down with his back against the door and said he would rest a minute and then kill me he put his knife under him and said he would sleep and get strong and then he would see who was who so he dozed off pretty soon by and by i got the old splitbottom chair and clumb up as easy as i could not to make any noise and got down the gun i slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded then i laid it across the turnip barrel pointing towards pap and set down behind it to wait for him to stir and how slow and still the time did drag along illustration git up chapter vii git up what you bout i opened my eyes and looked around trying to make out where i was it was after sunup and i had been sound asleep pap was standing over me looking sour and sick too he says what you doin with this gun i judged he didnt know nothing about what he had been doing so i says somebody tried to get in so i was laying for him why didnt you roust me out well i tried to but i couldnt i couldnt budge you well all right dont stand there palavering all day but out with you and see if theres a fish on the lines for breakfast ill be along in a minute he unlocked the door and i cleared out up the riverbank i noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down and a sprinkling of bark so i knowed the river had begun to rise i reckoned i would have great times now if i was over at the town the june rise used to be always luck for me because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down and pieces of log raftssometimes a dozen logs together so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the woodyards and the sawmill i went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and tother one out for what the rise might fetch along well all at once here comes a canoe just a beauty too about thirteen or fourteen foot long riding high like a duck i shot headfirst off of the bank like a frog clothes and all on and struck out for the canoe i just expected thered be somebody laying down in it because people often done that to fool folks and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it theyd raise up and laugh at him but it warnt so this time it was a drift canoe sure enough and i clumb in and paddled her ashore thinks i the old man will be glad when he sees thisshes worth ten dollars but when i got to shore pap wasnt in sight yet and as i was running her into a little creek like a gully all hung over with vines and willows i struck another idea i judged id hide her good and then stead of taking to the woods when i run off id go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good and not have such a rough time tramping on foot illustration the shanty it was pretty close to the shanty and i thought i heard the old man coming all the time but i got her hid and then i out and looked around a bunch of willows and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun so he hadnt seen anything when he got along i was hard at it taking up a trot line he abused me a little for being so slow but i told him i fell in the river and that was what made me so long i knowed he would see i was wet and then he would be asking questions we got five catfish off the lines and went home while we laid off after breakfast to sleep up both of us being about wore out i got to thinking that if i could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me you see all kinds of things might happen well i didnt see no way for a while but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water and he says another time a man comes aprowling round here you roust me out you hear that man warnt here for no good id a shot him next time you roust me out you hear then he dropped down and went to sleep again but what he had been saying give me the very idea i wanted i says to myself i can fix it now so nobody wont think of following me about twelve oclock we turned out and went along up the bank the river was coming up pretty fast and lots of driftwood going by on the rise by and by along comes part of a log raftnine logs fast together we went out with the skiff and towed it ashore then we had dinner anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through so as to catch more stuff but that warnt paps style nine logs was enough for one time he must shove right over to town and sell so he locked me in and took the skiff and started off towing the raft about halfpast three i judged he wouldnt come back that night i waited till i reckoned he had got a good start then i out with my saw and went to work on that log again before he was tother side of the river i was out of the hole him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder i took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in then i done the same with the side of bacon then the whiskyjug i took all the coffee and sugar there was and all the ammunition i took the wadding i took the bucket and gourd i took a dipper and a tin cup and my old saw and two blankets and the skillet and the coffeepot i took fishlines and matches and other thingseverything that was worth a cent i cleaned out the place i wanted an axe but there wasnt any only the one out at the woodpile and i knowed why i was going to leave that i fetched out the gun and now i was done i had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things so i fixed that as good as i could from the outside by scattering dust on the place which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust then i fixed the piece of log back into its place and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there for it was bent up at that place and didnt quite touch ground if you stood four or five foot away and didnt know it was sawed you wouldnt never notice it and besides this was the back of the cabin and it warnt likely anybody would go fooling around there it was all grass clear to the canoe so i hadnt left a track i followed around to see i stood on the bank and looked out over the river all safe so i took the gun and went up a piece into the woods and was hunting around for some birds when i see a wild pig hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms i shot this fellow and took him into camp illustration shooting the pig i took the axe and smashed in the door i beat it and hacked it considerable adoing it i fetched the pig in and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe and laid him down on the ground to bleed i say ground because it was groundhard packed and no boards well next i took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in itall i could dragand i started it from the pig and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in and down it sunk out of sight you could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground i did wish tom sawyer was there i knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business and throw in the fancy touches nobody could spread himself like tom sawyer in such a thing as that well last i pulled out some of my hair and blooded the axe good and stuck it on the back side and slung the axe in the corner then i took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket so he couldnt drip till i got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river now i thought of something else so i went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe and fetched them to the house i took the bag to where it used to stand and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw for there warnt no knives and forks on the placepap done everything with his claspknife about the cooking then i carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushesand ducks too you might say in the season there was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away i dont know where but it didnt go to the river the meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake i dropped paps whetstone there too so as to look like it had been done by accident then i tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string so it wouldnt leak no more and took it and my saw to the canoe again it was about dark now so i dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank and waited for the moon to rise i made fast to a willow then i took a bite to eat and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan i says to myself theyll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me and theyll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things they wont ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass theyll soon get tired of that and wont bother no more about me all right i can stop anywhere i want to jacksons island is good enough for me i know that island pretty well and nobody ever comes there and then i can paddle over to town nights and slink around and pick up things i want jacksons islands the place i was pretty tired and the first thing i knowed i was asleep when i woke up i didnt know where i was for a minute i set up and looked around a little scared then i remembered the river looked miles and miles across the moon was so bright i could a counted the drift logs that went aslipping along black and still hundreds of yards out from shore everything was dead quiet and it looked late and smelt late you know what i meani dont know the words to put it in i took a good gap and a stretch and was just going to unhitch and start when i heard a sound away over the water i listened pretty soon i made it out it was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when its a still night i peeped out through the willow branches and there it wasa skiff away across the water i couldnt tell how many was in it it kept acoming and when it was abreast of me i see there warnt but one man in it thinks i maybe its pap though i warnt expecting him he dropped below me with the current and by and by he came aswinging up shore in the easy water and he went by so close i could a reached out the gun and touched him well it was pap sure enoughand sober too by the way he laid his oars i didnt lose no time the next minute i was aspinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank i made two mile and a half and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river because pretty soon i would be passing the ferry landing and people might see me and hail me i got out amongst the driftwood and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float illustration taking a rest i laid there and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe looking away into the sky not a cloud in it the sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine i never knowed it before and how far a body can hear on the water such nights i heard people talking at the ferry landing i heard what they said tooevery word of it one man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now tother one said this warnt one of the short ones he reckonedand then they laughed and he said it over again and they laughed again then they waked up another fellow and told him and laughed but he didnt laugh he ripped out something brisk and said let him alone the first fellow said he lowed to tell it to his old womanshe would think it was pretty good but he said that warnt nothing to some things he had said in his time i heard one man say it was nearly three oclock and he hoped daylight wouldnt wait more than about a week longer after that the talk got further and further away and i couldnt make out the words any more but i could hear the mumble and now and then a laugh too but it seemed a long ways off i was away below the ferry now i rose up and there was jacksons island about two mile and a half down stream heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river big and dark and solid like a steamboat without any lights there warnt any signs of the bar at the headit was all under water now it didnt take me long to get there i shot past the head at a ripping rate the current was so swift and then i got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the illinois shore i run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that i knowed about i had to part the willow branches to get in and when i made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside i went up and set down on a log at the head of the island and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town three mile away where there was three or four lights twinkling a monstrous big lumberraft was about a mile up stream coming along down with a lantern in the middle of it i watched it come creeping down and when it was most abreast of where i stood i heard a man say stern oars there heave her head to stabboard i heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side there was a little gray in the sky now so i stepped into the woods and laid down for a nap before breakfast illustration in the woods chapter viii the sun was up so high when i waked that i judged it was after eight oclock i laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied i could see the sun out at one or two holes but mostly it was big trees all about and gloomy in there amongst them there was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves and the freckled places swapped about a little showing there was a little breeze up there a couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly i was powerful lazy and comfortabledidnt want to get up and cook breakfast well i was dozing off again when i thinks i hears a deep sound of boom away up the river i rouses up and rests on my elbow and listens pretty soon i hears it again i hopped up and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves and i see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways upabout abreast the ferry and there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down i knowed what was the matter now boom i see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboats side you see they was firing cannon over the water trying to make my carcass come to the top i was pretty hungry but it warnt going to do for me to start a fire because they might see the smoke so i set there and watched the cannonsmoke and listened to the boom the river was a mile wide there and it always looks pretty on a summer morningso i was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if i only had a bite to eat well then i happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there so says i ill keep a lookout and if any of thems floating around after me ill give them a show i changed to the illinois edge of the island to see what luck i could have and i warnt disappointed a big double loaf come along and i most got it with a long stick but my foot slipped and she floated out further of course i was where the current set in the closest to the shorei knowed enough for that but by and by along comes another one and this time i won i took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver and set my teeth in it was bakers breadwhat the quality eat none of your lowdown cornpone i got a good place amongst the leaves and set there on a log munching the bread and watching the ferryboat and very well satisfied and then something struck me i says now i reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me and here it has gone and done it so there aint no doubt but there is something in that thingthat is theres something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays but it dont work for me and i reckon it dont work for only just the right kind illustration watching the boat i lit a pipe and had a good long smoke and went on watching the ferryboat was floating with the current and i allowed id have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along because she would come in close where the bread did when shed got pretty well along down towards me i put out my pipe and went to where i fished out the bread and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place where the log forked i could peep through by and by she come along and she drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore most everybody was on the boat pap and judge thatcher and bessie thatcher and jo harper and tom sawyer and his old aunt polly and sid and mary and plenty more everybody was talking about the murder but the captain broke in and says look sharp now the current sets in the closest here and maybe hes washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the waters edge i hope so anyway i didnt hope so they all crowded up and leaned over the rails nearly in my face and kept still watching with all their might i could see them firstrate but they couldnt see me then the captain sung out stand away and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke and i judged i was gone if theyd a had some bullets in i reckon theyd a got the corpse they was after well i see i warnt hurt thanks to goodness the boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island i could hear the booming now and then further and further off and by and by after an hour i didnt hear it no more the island was three mile long i judged they had got to the foot and was giving it up but they didnt yet a while they turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the missouri side under steam and booming once in a while as they went i crossed over to that side and watched them when they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the missouri shore and went home to the town i knowed i was all right now nobody else would come ahunting after me i got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods i made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldnt get at them i catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw and towards sundown i started my camp fire and had supper then i set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast when it was dark i set by my camp fire smoking and feeling pretty well satisfied but by and by it got sort of lonesome and so i went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down and then went to bed there aint no better way to put in time when you are lonesome you cant stay so you soon get over it and so for three days and nights no differencejust the same thing but the next day i went exploring around down through the island i was boss of it it all belonged to me so to say and i wanted to know all about it but mainly i wanted to put in the time i found plenty strawberries ripe and prime and green summer grapes and green razberries and the green blackberries was just beginning to show they would all come handy by and by i judged well i went fooling along in the deep woods till i judged i warnt far from the foot of the island i had my gun along but i hadnt shot nothing it was for protection thought i would kill some game nigh home about this time i mighty near stepped on a goodsized snake and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers and i after it trying to get a shot at it i clipped along and all of a sudden i bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking illustration discovering the camp fire my heart jumped up amongst my lungs i never waited for to look further but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever i could every now and then i stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened but my breath come so hard i couldnt hear nothing else i slunk along another piece further then listened again and so on and so on if i see a stump i took it for a man if i trod on a stick and broke it it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and i only got half and the short half too when i got to camp i warnt feeling very brash there warnt much sand in my craw but i says this aint no time to be fooling around so i got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight and i put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last years camp and then clumb a tree i reckon i was up in the tree two hours but i didnt see nothing i didnt hear nothingi only thought i heard and seen as much as a thousand things well i couldnt stay up there forever so at last i got down but i kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time all i could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast by the time it was night i was pretty hungry so when it was good and dark i slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the illinois bankabout a quarter of a mile i went out in the woods and cooked a supper and i had about made up my mind i would stay there all night when i hear a plunketyplunk plunketyplunk and says to myself horses coming and next i hear peoples voices i got everything into the canoe as quick as i could and then went creeping through the woods to see what i could find out i hadnt got far when i hear a man say we better camp here if we can find a good place the horses is about beat out lets look around i didnt wait but shoved out and paddled away easy i tied up in the old place and reckoned i would sleep in the canoe i didnt sleep much i couldnt somehow for thinking and every time i waked up i thought somebody had me by the neck so the sleep didnt do me no good by and by i says to myself i cant live this way im agoing to find out who it is thats here on the island with me ill find it out or bust well i felt better right off so i took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows the moon was shining and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day i poked along well on to an hour everything still as rocks and sound asleep well by this time i was most down to the foot of the island a little ripply cool breeze begun to blow and that was as good as saying the night was about done i give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore then i got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods i sat down there on a log and looked out through the leaves i see the moon go off watch and the darkness begin to blanket the river but in a little while i see a pale streak over the treetops and knowed the day was coming so i took my gun and slipped off towards where i had run across that camp fire stopping every minute or two to listen but i hadnt no luck somehow i couldnt seem to find the place but by and by sure enough i catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees i went for it cautious and slow by and by i was close enough to have a look and there laid a man on the ground it most give me the fantods he had a blanket around his head and his head was nearly in the fire i set there behind a clump of bushes in about six foot of him and kept my eyes on him steady it was getting gray daylight now pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket and it was miss watsons jim i bet i was glad to see him i says hello jim and skipped out he bounced up and stared at me wild then he drops down on his knees and puts his hands together and says doan hurt medont i haint ever done no harm to a ghos i alwuz liked dead people en done all i could for em you go en git in de river agin whah you blongs en doan do nuffn to ole jim at uz awluz yo fren illustration jim and the ghost well i warnt long making him understand i warnt dead i was ever so glad to

place amongst the trees i fetched meal and bacon and coffee and coffeepot and fryingpan and sugar and tin cups and the nigger was set back considerable because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft i catched a good big catfish too and jim cleaned him with his knife and fried him when breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot jim laid it in with all his might for he was most about starved then when we had got pretty well stuffed we laid off and lazied by and by jim says but looky here huck who wuz it dat uz killed in dat shanty ef it warnt you then i told him the whole thing and he said it was smart he said tom sawyer couldnt get up no better plan than what i had then i says how do you come to be here jim and howd you get here he looked pretty uneasy

said you mustnt count the things you are going to cook for dinner because that would bring bad luck the same if you shook the tablecloth after sundown and he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died the bees must be told about it before sunup next morning or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die jim said bees wouldnt sting idiots but i didnt believe that because i had

i wouldn want no mo illustration exploring the cave chapter ix i wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that id found when i was exploring so we started and soon got to it because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide this place was a tolerable long steep hill or ridge about forty foot high we had a rough time getting to the top the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick we tramped and clumb around all over it and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock most up to the top on the side towards illinois the cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together and jim could stand up straight in it it was cool in there jim was for putting our traps in there right away but i said we didnt want to be climbing up and down there all the time jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place and had all the traps in the cavern we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island and they would never find us without dogs and besides he said them little birds had said it was going to rain and did i want the things to get wet so we went back and got the canoe and paddled up abreast the cavern and lugged all the traps up there then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in amongst the thick willows we took some fish off of the lines and set them again and begun to get ready for dinner the door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit and was flat and a good place to build a fire on so we built it there and cooked dinner illustration in the cave we spread the blankets inside for a carpet and eat our dinner in there we put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern pretty soon it darkened up and begun to thunder and lighten so the birds was right about it directly it begun to rain and it rained like all fury too and i never see the wind blow so it was one of these regular summer storms it would get so dark that it looked all blueblack outside and lovely and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spiderwebby and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild and next when it was just about the bluest and blackestfst it was as bright as glory and youd have a little glimpse of treetops aplunging about away off yonder in the storm hundreds of yards further than you could see before dark as sin again in a second and now youd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash and then go rumbling grumbling tumbling down the sky towards the under side of the world like rolling empty barrels down stairswhere its long stairs and they bounce a good deal you know jim this is nice i says i wouldnt want to be nowhere else but here pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot cornbread well you wouldnt a ben here f it hadnt a ben for jim youd a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner en gittn mos drownded too dat you would honey chickens knows when its gwyne to rain en so do de birds chile the river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days till at last it was over the banks the water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the illinois bottom on that side it was a good many miles wide but on the missouri side it was the same old distance acrossa half a milebecause the missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe it was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods even if the sun was blazing outside we went winding in and out amongst the trees and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way well on every old brokendown tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame on account of being hungry that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to but not the snakes and turtlesthey would slide off in the water the ridge our cavern was in was full of them we could a had pets enough if wed wanted them one night we catched a little section of a lumber raftnice pine planks it was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long and the top stood above water six or seven inchesa solid level floor we could see sawlogs go by in the daylight sometimes but we let them go we didnt show ourselves in daylight another night when we was up at the head of the island just before daylight here comes a framehouse down on the west side she was a twostory and tilted over considerable we paddled out and got aboardclumb in at an upstairs window but it was too dark to see yet so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight the light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island then we looked in at the window we could make out a bed and a table and two old chairs and lots of things around about on the floor and there was clothes hanging against the wall there was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man so jim says hello you but it didnt budge so i hollered again and then jim says de man aint asleephes dead you hold stillill go en see he went and bent down and looked and says its a dead man yes indeedy naked too hes ben shot in de back i reckn hes ben dead two er three days come in huck but doan look at his faceits too gashly illustration jim sees a dead man i didnt look at him at all jim throwed some old rags over him but he neednt done it i didnt want to see him there was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor and old whisky bottles and a couple of masks made out of black cloth and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal there was two old dirty calico dresses and a sunbonnet and some womens underclothes hanging against the wall and some mens clothing too we put the lot into the canoeit might come good there was a boys old speckled straw hat on the floor i took that too and there was a bottle that had had milk in it and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck we would a took the bottle but it was broke there was a seedy old chest and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke they stood open but there warnt nothing left in them that was any account the way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry and warnt fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff we got an old tin lantern and a butcherknife without any handle and a brannew barlow knife worth two bits in any store and a lot of tallow candles and a tin candlestick and a gourd and a tin cup and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it and a hatchet and some nails and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it and a roll of buckskin and a leather dogcollar and a horseshoe and some vials of medicine that didnt have no label on them and just as we was leaving i found a tolerable good currycomb and jim he found a ratty old fiddlebow and a wooden leg the straps was broke off of it but barring that it was a good enough leg though it was too long for me and not long enough for jim and we couldnt find the other one though we hunted all around and so take it all around we made a good haul when we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island and it was pretty broad day so i made jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off i paddled over to the illinois shore and drifted down most a half a mile doing it i crept up the dead water under the bank and hadnt no accidents and didnt see nobody we got home all safe illustration they found eight dollars chapter x after breakfast i wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed but jim didnt want to he said it would fetch bad luck and besides he said he might come and hant us he said a man that warnt buried was more likely to go ahanting around than one that was planted and comfortable that sounded pretty reasonable so i didnt say no more but i couldnt keep from studying over it and wishing i knowed who shot the man and what they done it for we rummaged the clothes wed got and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat because if theyd a knowed the money was there they wouldnt a left it i said i reckoned they killed him too but jim didnt want to talk about that i says now you think its bad luck but what did you say when i fetched in the snakeskin that i found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday you said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snakeskin with my hands well heres your bad luck weve raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides i wish we could have some bad luck like this every day jim never you mind honey never you mind dont you git too peart its acomin mind i tell you its acomin it did come too it was a tuesday that we had that talk well after dinner friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge and got out of tobacco i went to the cavern to get some and found a rattlesnake in there i killed him and curled him up on the foot of jims blanket ever so natural thinking thered be some fun when jim found him there well by night i forgot all about the snake and when jim flung himself down on the blanket while i struck a light the snakes mate was there and bit him he jumped up yelling and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring i laid him out in a second with a stick and jim grabbed paps whiskyjug and begun to pour it down illustration jim and the snake he was barefooted and the snake bit him right on the heel that all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it jim told me to chop off the snakes head and throw it away and then skin the body and roast a piece of it i done it and he eat it and said it would help cure him he made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist too he said that that would help then i slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes for i warnt going to let jim find out it was all my fault not if i could help it jim sucked and sucked at the jug and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again his foot swelled up pretty big and so did his leg but by and by the drunk begun to come and so i judged he was all right but id druther been bit with a snake than paps whisky jim was laid up for four days and nights then the swelling was all gone and he was around again i made up my mind i wouldnt ever take aholt of a snakeskin again with my hands now that i see what had come of it jim said he reckoned i would believe him next time and he said that handling a snakeskin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadnt got to the end of it yet he said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snakeskin in his hand well i was getting to feel that way myself though ive always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do old hank bunker done it once and bragged about it and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shottower and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer as you may say and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin and buried him so so they say but i didnt see it pap told me but anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way like a fool illustration old hank bunker well the days went along and the river went down between its banks again and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man being six foot two inches long and weighed over two hundred pounds we couldnt handle him of course he would a flung us into illinois we just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded we found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball and lots of rubbage we split the ball open with the hatchet and there was a spool in it jim said hed had it there a long time to coat it over so and make a ball of it it was as big a fish as was ever catched in the mississippi i reckon jim said he hadnt ever seen a bigger one he would a been worth a good deal over at the village they peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the markethouse there everybody buys some of him his meats as white as snow and makes a good fry next morning i said it was getting slow and dull and i wanted to get a stirring up some way i said i reckoned i would slip over the river and find out what was going on jim liked that notion but he said i must go in the dark and look sharp then he studied it over and said couldnt i put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl that was a good notion too so we shortened up one of the calico gowns and i turned up my trouserlegs to my knees and got into it jim hitched it behind with the hooks and it was a fair fit i put on the sunbonnet and tied it under my chin and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stovepipe jim said nobody would know me even in the daytime hardly i practiced around all day to get the hang of the things and by and by i could do pretty well in them only jim said i didnt walk like a girl and he said i must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britchespocket i took notice and done better illustration a fair fit i started up the illinois shore in the canoe just after dark i started across to the town from a little below the ferrylanding and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town i tied up and started along the bank there was a light burning in a little shanty that hadnt been lived in for a long time and i wondered who had took up quarters there i slipped up and peeped in at the window there was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table i didnt know her face she was a stranger for you couldnt start a face in that town that i didnt know now this was lucky because i was weakening i was getting afraid i had come people might know my voice and find me out but if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all i wanted to know so i knocked at the door and made up my mind i wouldnt forget i was a girl illustration come in chapter xi come in says the woman and i did she says take a cheer i done it she looked me all over with her little shiny eyes and says what might your name be sarah williams where bouts do you live in this neighborhood nom in hookerville seven mile below ive walked all the way and im all tired out hungry too i reckon ill find you something nom i aint hungry i was so hungry i had to stop two miles below here at a farm so i aint hungry no more its what makes me so late my mothers down sick and out of money and everything and i come to tell my uncle abner moore he lives at the upper end of the town she says i haint ever been here before do you know him no but i dont know everybody yet i havent lived here quite two weeks its a considerable ways to the upper end of the town you better stay here all night take off your bonnet no i says ill rest a while i reckon and go on i aint afeared of the dark she said she wouldnt let me go by myself but her husband would be in by and by maybe in a hour and a half and shed send him along with me then she got to talking about her husband and about her relations up the river and her relations down the river and about how much better off they used to was and how they didnt know but theyd made a mistake coming to our town instead of letting well aloneand so on and so on till i was afeard i had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder and then i was pretty willing to let her clatter right along she told about me and tom sawyer finding the six thousand dollars only she got it ten and all about pap and what a hard lot he was and what a hard lot i was and at last she got down to where i was murdered i says who done it weve heard considerable about these goings on down in hookerville but we dont know who twas that killed huck finn well i reckon theres a right smart chance of people here thatd like to know who killed him some think old finn done it himself nois that so most everybody thought it at first hell never know how nigh he come to getting lynched but before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named jim why he i stopped i reckoned i better keep still she run on and never noticed i had put in at all the nigger run off the very night huck finn was killed so theres a reward out for himthree hundred dollars and theres a reward out for old finn tootwo hundred dollars you see he come to town the morning after the murder and told about it and was out with em on the ferryboat hunt and right away after he up and left before night they wanted to lynch him but he was gone you see well next day they found out the nigger was gone they found out he hadnt ben seen sence ten oclock the night the murder was done so then they put it on him you see and while they was full of it next day back comes old finn and went boohooing to judge thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over illinois with the judge gave him some and that evening he got drunk and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hardlooking strangers and then went off with them well he haint come back sence and they aint looking for him back till this thing blows over a little for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it and then hed get hucks money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit people do say he warnt any too good to do it oh hes sly i reckon if he dont come back for a year hell be all right you cant prove anything on him you know everything will be quieted down then and hell walk in hucks money as easy as nothing yes i reckon so m i dont see nothing in the way of it has everybody guit thinking the nigger done it oh no not everybody a good many thinks he done it but theyll get the nigger pretty soon now and maybe they can scare it out of him why are they after him yet well youre innocent aint you does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up some folks think the nigger aint far from here im one of thembut i haint talked it around a few days ago i was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call jacksons island dont anybody live there says i no nobody says they i didnt say any more but i done some thinking i was pretty near certain id seen smoke over there about the head of the island a day or two before that so i says to myself like as not that niggers hiding over there anyway says i its worth the trouble to give the place a hunt i haint seen any smoke sence so i reckon maybe hes gone if it was him but husbands going over to seehim and another man he was gone up the river but he got back today and i told him as soon as he got here two hours ago illustration him and another man i had got so uneasy i couldnt set still i had to do something with my hands so i took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it my hands shook and i was making a bad job of it when the woman stopped talking i looked up and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little i put down the needle and thread and let on to be interestedand i was tooand says three hundred dollars is a power of money i wish my mother could get it is your husband going over there tonight oh yes he went uptown with the man i was telling you of to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun theyll go over after midnight couldnt they see better if they was to wait till daytime yes and couldnt the nigger see better too after midnight hell likely be asleep and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark if hes got one i didnt think of that the woman kept looking at me pretty curious and i didnt feel a bit comfortable pretty soon she says what did you say your name was honey mmary williams somehow it didnt seem to me that i said it was mary before so i didnt look upseemed to me i said it was sarah so i felt sort of cornered and was afeared maybe i was looking it too i wished the woman would say something more the longer she set still the uneasier i was but now she says honey i thought you said it was sarah when you first come in oh yesm i did sarah mary williams sarahs my first name some calls me sarah some calls me mary oh thats the way of it yesm i was feeling better then but i wished i was out of there anyway i couldnt look up yet well the woman fell to talking about how hard times was and how poor they had to live and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place and so forth and so on and then i got easy again she was right about the rats youd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while she said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone or they wouldnt give her no peace she showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot and said she was a good shot with it generly but shed wrenched her arm a day or two ago and didnt know whether she could throw true now but she watched for a chance and directly banged away at a rat but she missed him wide and said ouch it hurt her arm so then she told me to try for the next one i wanted to be getting away before the old man got back but of course i didnt let on i got the thing and the first rat that showed his nose i let drive and if hed a stayed where he was hed a been a tolerable sick rat she said that was firstrate and she reckoned i would hive the next one she went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with i held up my two hands and she put the hank over them and went on talking about her and her husbands matters but she broke off to say keep your eye on the rats you better have the lead in your lap handy so she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment and i clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking but only about a minute then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face and very pleasant and says come now whats your real name whwhat mum whats your real name is it bill or tom or bobor what is it i reckon i shook like a leaf and i didnt know hardly what to do but i says please to dont poke fun at a poor girl like me mum if im in the way here ill no you wont set down and stay where you are i aint going to hurt you and i aint going to tell on you nuther you just tell me your secret and trust me ill keep it and whats more ill help you soll my old man if you want him to you see youre a runaway prentice thats all it aint anything there aint no harm in it youve been treated bad and you made up your mind to cut bless you child i wouldnt tell on you tell me all about it now thats a good boy so i said it wouldnt be no use to try to play it any longer and i would just make a clean breast and tell her everything but she musnt go back on her promise then i told her my father and mother was dead and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river and he treated me so bad i couldnt stand it no longer he went away to be gone a couple of days and so i took my chance and stole some of his daughters old clothes and cleared out and i had been three nights coming the thirty miles i traveled nights and hid daytimes and slept and the bag of bread and meat i carried from home lasted me all the way and i had aplenty i said i believed my uncle abner moore would take care of me and so that was why i struck out for this town of goshen goshen child this aint goshen this is st petersburg goshens ten mile further up the river who told you this was goshen why a man i met at daybreak this morning just as i was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep he told me when the roads forked i must take the right hand and five mile would fetch me to goshen he was drunk i reckon he told you just exactly wrong well he did act like he was drunk but it aint no matter now i got to be moving along ill fetch goshen before daylight hold on a minute ill put you up a snack to eat you might want it illustration she puts up a snack so she put me up a snack and says say when a cows laying down which end of her gets up first answer up prompt nowdont stop to study over it which end gets up first the hind end mum well then a horse the forrard end mum which side of a tree does the moss grow on north side if fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction the whole fifteen mum well i reckon you have lived in the country i thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again whats your real name now george peters mum well try to remember it george dont forget and tell me its elexander before you go and then get out by saying its george elexander when i catch you and dont go about women in that old calico you do a girl tolerable poor but you might fool men maybe bless you child when you set out to thread a needle dont hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it hold the needle still and poke the thread at it thats the way a woman most always does but a man always does tother way and when you throw at a rat or anything hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can and miss your rat about six or seven foot throw stiffarmed from the shoulder like there was a pivot there for it to turn on like a girl not from the wrist and elbow with your arm out to one side like a boy and mind you when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart she dont clap them together the way you did when you catched the lump of lead why i spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle and i contrived the other things just to make certain now trot along to your uncle sarah mary williams george elexander peters and if you get into trouble you send word to mrs judith loftus which is me and ill do what i can to get you out of it keep the river road all the way and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you the river roads a rocky one and your feetll be in a condition when you get to goshen i reckon i went up the bank about fifty yards and then i doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was a good piece below the house i jumped in and was off in a hurry i went upstream far enough to make the head of the island and then started across i took off the sun bonnet for i didnt want no blinders on then when i was about the middle i heard the clock begin to strike so i stops and listens the sound come faint over the water but cleareleven when i struck the head of the island i never waited to blow though i was most winded but i shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot then i jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place a mile and a half below as hard as i could go i landed and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern there jim laid sound asleep on the ground i roused him out and says git up and hump yourself jim there aint a minute to lose theyre after us illustration hump yourself jim never asked no questions he never said a word but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared by that time everything we had in the world was on our raft and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid we put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing and didnt show a candle outside after that i took the canoe out from the shore a little piece and took a look but if there was a boat around i couldnt see it for stars and shadows aint good to see by then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade past the foot of the island dead stillnever saying a word illustration on the raft chapter xii it must a been close on to one oclock when we got below the island at last and the raft did seem to go mighty slow if a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the illinois shore and it was well a boat didnt come for we hadnt ever thought to put the gun in the canoe or a fishingline or anything to eat we was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things it warnt good judgment to put everything on the raft if the men went to the island i just expect they found the camp fire i built and watched it all night for jim to come anyways they stayed away from us and if my building the fire never fooled them it warnt no fault of mine i played it as low down on them as i could when the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the illinois side and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cavein in the bank there a towhead is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrowteeth we had mountains on the missouri shore and heavy timber on the illinois side and the channel was down the missouri shore at that place so we warnt afraid of anybody running across us we laid there all day and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the missouri shore and up bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle i told jim all about the time i had jabbering with that woman and jim said she was a smart one and if she was to start after us herself she wouldnt set down and watch a camp fireno sir shed fetch a dog well then i said why couldnt she tell her husband to fetch a dog jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start and he believed they must a gone uptown to get a dog and so they lost all that time or else we wouldnt be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the villageno indeedy we would be in that same old town again so i said i didnt care what was the reason they didnt get us as long as they didnt when it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket and looked up and down and across nothing in sight so jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy and to keep the things dry jim made a floor for the wigwam and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly the wigwam would keep it from being seen we made an extra steeringoar too because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something we fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming downstream to keep from getting run over but we wouldnt have to light it for upstream boats unless we see we was in what they call a crossing for the river was pretty high yet very low banks being still a little under water so upbound boats didnt always run the channel but hunted easy water this second night we run between seven and eight hours with a current that was making over four mile an hour we catched fish and talked and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness it was kind of solemn drifting down the big still river laying on our backs looking up at the stars and we didnt ever feel like talking loud and it warnt often that we laughedonly a little kind of a low chuckle we had mighty good weather as a general thing and nothing ever happened to us at allthat night nor the next nor the next every night we passed towns some of them away up on black hillsides nothing but just a shiny bed of lights not a house could you see the fifth night we passed st louis and it was like the whole world lit up in st petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in st louis but i never believed it till i see that wonderful spread of lights at two oclock that still night there warnt a sound there everybody was asleep every night now i used to slip ashore towards ten oclock at some little village and buy ten or fifteen cents worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat and sometimes i lifted a chicken that warnt roosting comfortable and took him along pap always said take a chicken when you get a chance because if you dont want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does and a good deed aint ever forgot i never see pap when he didnt want the chicken himself but that is what he used to say anyway illustration he sometimes lifted a chicken mornings before daylight i slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon or a mushmelon or a punkin or some new corn or things of that kind pap always said it warnt no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time but the widow said it warnt anything but a soft name for stealing and no decent body would do it jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we wouldnt borrow them any morethen he reckoned it wouldnt be no harm to borrow the others so we talked it over all one night drifting along down the river trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons or the cantelopes or the mushmelons or what but towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory and concluded to drop crabapples and psimmons we warnt feeling just right before that but it was all comfortable now i was glad the way it come out too because crabapples aint ever good and the psimmons wouldnt be ripe for two or three months yet we shot a waterfowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or didnt go to bed early enough in the evening take it all round we lived pretty high the fifth night below st louis we had a big storm after midnight with a power of thunder and lightning and the rain poured down in a solid sheet we stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself when the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead and high rocky bluffs on both sides by and by says i hello jim looky yonder it was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock we was drifting straight down for her the lightning showed her very distinct she was leaning over with part of her upper deck above water and you could see every little chimblyguy clean and clear and a chair by the big bell with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it when the flashes come well it being away in the night and stormy and all so mysteriouslike i felt just the way any other boy would a felt when i see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river i wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little and see what there was there so i says les land on her jim but jim was dead against it at first he says i doan want to go fooln long er no wrack wes doin blame well en we better let blame well alone as de good book says like as not deys a watchman on dat wrack watchman your grandmother i says there aint nothing to watch but the texas and the pilothouse and do you reckon anybodys going to resk his life for a texas and a pilothouse such a night as this when its likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute jim couldnt say nothing to that so he didnt try and besides i says we might borrow something worth having out of the captains stateroom seegars i bet youand cost five cents apiece solid cash steamboat captains is always rich and get sixty dollars a month and they dont care a cent what a thing costs you know long as they want it stick a candle in your pocket i cant rest jim till we give her a rummaging do you reckon tom sawyer would ever go by this thing not for pie he wouldnt hed call it an adventurethats what hed call it and hed land on that wreck if it was his last act and wouldnt he throw style into itwouldnt he spread himself nor nothing why youd think it was christopher clumbus discovering kingdomcome i wish tom sawyer was here jim he grumbled a little but give in he said we mustnt talk any more than we could help and then talk mighty low the lightning showed us the wreck again just in time and we fetched the stabboard derrick and made fast there the deck was high out here we went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard in the dark towards the texas feeling our way slow with our feet and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys for it was so dark we couldnt see no sign of them pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight and clumb on to it and the next step fetched us in front of the captains door which was open and by jimminy away down through the texashall we see a light and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick and told me to come along i says all right and was going to start for the raft but just then i heard a voice wail out and say oh please dont boys i swear i wont ever tell another voice said pretty loud its a lie jim turner youve acted this way before you always want moren your share of the truck and youve always got it too because youve swore t if you didnt youd tell but this time youve said it jest one time too many youre the meanest treacherousest hound in this country by this time jim was gone for the raft i was just abiling with curiosity and i says to myself tom sawyer wouldnt back out now and so i wont either im agoing to see whats going on here so i dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage and crept aft in the dark till there warnt but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross hall of the texas then in there i see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot and two men standing over him and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand and the other one had a pistol this one kept pointing the pistol at the mans head on the floor and saying id like to and i orter tooa mean skunk illustration please dont bill the man on the floor would shrivel up and say oh please dont bill i haint ever goin to tell and every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say deed you aint you never said no truer thing n that you bet you and once he said hear him beg and yit if we hadnt got the best of him and tied him hed a killed us both and what for jist for nothn jist because we stood on our rightsthats what for but i lay you aint agoin to threaten nobody any more jim turner put up that pistol bill bill says i dont want to jake packard im for killin himand didnt he kill old hatfield jist the same wayand dont he deserve it but i dont want him killed and ive got my reasons for it bless yo heart for them words jake packard ill never forgit you longs i live says the man on the floor sort of blubbering packard didnt take no notice of that but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where i was there in the dark and motioned bill to come i crawfished as fast as i could about two yards but the boat slanted so that i couldnt make very good time so to keep from getting run over and catched i crawled into a stateroom on the upper side the man came apawing along in the dark and when packard got to my stateroom he says herecome in here and in he come and bill after him but before they got in i was up in the upper berth cornered and sorry i come then they stood there with their hands on the ledge of the berth and talked i couldnt see them but i could tell where they was by the whisky theyd been having i was glad i didnt drink whisky but it wouldnt made much difference anyway because most of the time they couldnt a treed me because i didnt breathe i was too scared and besides a body couldnt breathe and hear such talk they talked low and earnest bill wanted to kill turner he says hes said hell tell and he will if we was to give both our shares to him now it wouldnt make no difference after the row and the way weve served him shores youre born hell turn states evidence now you hear me im for putting him out of his troubles som i says packard very quiet blame it id sorter begun to think you wasnt well then thats all right les go and do it hold on a minute i haint had my say yit you listen to me shootings good but theres quieter ways if the things got to be done but what i say is this it aint good sense to go courtn around after a halter if you can git at what youre up to in some way thats jist as good and at the same time dont bring you into no resks aint that so you bet it is but how you goin to manage it this time well my idea is this well rustle around and gather up whatever pickins weve overlooked in the staterooms and shove for shore and hide the truck then well wait now i say it aint agoin to be moren two hours befo this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river see hell be drownded and wont have nobody to blame for it but his own self i reckon thats a considerble sight better n killin of him im unfavorable to killin a man as long as you can git aroun it it aint good sense it aint good morals aint i right illustration it aint good morals yes i reckn you are but spose she dont break up and wash off well we can wait the two hours anyway and see cant we all right then come along so they started and i lit out all in a cold sweat and scrambled forward it was dark as pitch there but i said in a kind of a coarse whisper jim and he answered up right at my elbow with a sort of a moan and i says quick jim it aint no time for fooling around and moaning theres a gang of murderers in yonder and if we dont hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows cant get away from the wreck theres one of em going to be in a bad fix but if we find their boat we can put all of em in a bad fixfor the sheriff ll get em quickhurry ill hunt the labboard side you hunt the stabboard you start at the raft and oh my lordy lordy raf dey ain no raf no mo she done broke loose en gone ien here we is illustration oh lordy lordy illustration in a fix chapter xiii well i catched my breath and most fainted shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that but it warnt no time to be sentimentering wed got to find that boat nowhad to have it for ourselves so we went aquaking and shaking down the stabboard side and slow work it was tooseemed a week before we got to the stern no sign of a boat jim said he didnt believe he could go any furtherso scared he hadnt hardly any strength left he said but i said come on if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix sure so on we prowled again we struck for the stern of the texas and found it and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight hanging on from shutter to shutter for the edge of the skylight was in the water when we got pretty close to the crosshall door there was the skiff sure enough i could just barely see her i felt ever so thankful in another second i would a been aboard of her but just then the door opened one of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me and i thought i was gone but he jerked it in again and says heave that blame lantern out o sight bill he flung a bag of something into the boat and then got in himself and set down it was packard then bill he come out and got in packard says in a low voice all readyshove off i couldnt hardly hang on to the shutters i was so weak but bill says hold ond you go through him no didnt you no so hes got his share o the cash yet well then come along no use to take truck and leave money say wont he suspicion what were up to maybe he wont but we got to have it anyway come along so they got out and went in the door slammed to because it was on the careened side and in a half second i was in the boat and jim come tumbling after me i out with my knife and cut the rope and away we went we didnt touch an oar and we didnt speak nor whisper nor hardly even breathe we went gliding swift along dead silent past the tip of the paddlebox and past the stern then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck and the darkness soaked her up every last sign of her and we was safe and knowed it when we was three or four hundred yards downstream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as jim turner was then jim manned the oars and we took out after our raft now was the first time that i begun to worry about the meni reckon i hadnt had time to before i begun to think how dreadful it was even for murderers to be in such a fix i says to myself there aint no telling but i might come to be a murderer myself yet and then how would i like it so says i to jim the first light we see well land a hundred yards below it or above it in a place where its a good hidingplace for you and the skiff and then ill go and fix up some kind of a yarn and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape so they can be hung when their time comes but that idea was a failure for pretty soon it begun to storm again and this time worse than ever the rain poured down and never a light showed everybody in bed i reckon we boomed along down the river watching for lights and watching for our raft after a long time the rain let up but the clouds stayed and the lightning kept whimpering and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead floating and we made for it it was the raft and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again we seen a light now away down to the right on shore so i said i would go for it the skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck we hustled it on to the raft in a pile and i told jim to float along down and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile and keep it burning till i come then i manned my oars and shoved for the light as i got down towards it three or four more showedup on a hillside it was a village i closed in above the shore light and laid on my oars and floated as i went by i see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a doublehull ferryboat i skimmed around for the watchman awondering whereabouts he slept and by and by i found him roosting on the bitts forward with his head down between his knees i gave his shoulder two or three little shoves and begun to cry he stirred up in a kind of a startlish way but when he see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch and then he says hello whats up dont cry bub whats the trouble illustration hello whats up i says pap and mam and sis and then i broke down he says oh dang it now dont take on so we all has to have our troubles and this n ll come out all right whats the matter with em theyretheyreare you the watchman of the boat yes he says kind of prettywellsatisfied like im the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck hand and sometimes im the freight and passengers i aint as rich as old jim hornback and i cant be so blame generous and good to tom dick and harry as what he is and slam around money the way he does but ive told him a many a time t i wouldnt trade places with him for says i a sailors lifes the life for me and im derned if id live two mile out o town where there aint nothing ever goin on not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it says i i broke in and says theyre in an awful peck of trouble and who is why pap and mam and sis and miss hooker and if youd take your ferryboat and go up there up where where are they on the wreck what wreck why there aint but one what you dont mean the walter scott yes good land what are they doin there for gracious sakes well they didnt go there apurpose i bet they didnt why great goodness there aint no chance for em if they dont git off mighty quick why how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape easy enough miss hooker was avisiting up there to the town yes booths landinggo on she was avisiting there at booths landing and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horseferry to stay all night at her friends house miss whatyoumaycallher i disremember her nameand they lost their steeringoar and swung around and went afloating down stern first about two mile and saddle baggsed on the wreck and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost but miss hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck well about an hour after dark we come along down in our tradingscow and it was so dark we didnt notice the wreck till we was right on it and so we saddlebaggsed but all of us was saved but bill whippleand oh he was the best creturi most wish t it had been me i do my george its the beatenest thing i ever struck and then what did you all do well we hollered and took on but its so wide there we couldnt make nobody hear so pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow i was the only one that could swim so i made a dash for it and miss hooker she said if i didnt strike help sooner come here and hunt up her uncle and hed fix the thing i made the land about a mile below and been fooling along ever since trying to get people to do something but they said what in such a night and such a current there aint no sense in it go for the steam ferry now if youll go and by jackson id like to and blame it i dont know but i will but who in the dingnations agoing to pay for it do you reckon your pap why thats all right miss hooker she tole me particular that her uncle hornback great guns is he her uncle looky here you break for that light over yonderway and turn out west when you git there and about a quarter of a mile out youll come to the tavern tell em to dart you out to jim hornbacks and hell foot the bill and dont you fool around any because hell want to know the news tell him ill have his niece all safe before he can get to town hump yourself now im agoing up around the corner here to roust out my engineer i struck for the light but as soon as he turned the corner i went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards and tucked myself in among some woodboats for i couldnt rest easy till i could see the ferryboat start but take it all around i was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang for not many would a done it i wished the widow knowed about it i judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in illustration the wreck well before long here comes the wreck dim and dusky sliding along down a kind of cold shiver went through me and then i struck out for her she was very deep and i see in a minute there warnt much chance for anybody being alive in her i pulled all around her and hollered a little but there wasnt any answer all dead still i felt a little bit heavyhearted about the gang but not much for i reckoned if they could stand it i could then here comes the ferryboat so i shoved for the middle of the river on a long downstream slant and when i judged i was out of eyereach i laid on my oars and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for miss hookers remainders because the captain would know her uncle hornback would want them and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore and i laid into my work and went abooming down the river it did seem a powerful long time before jims light showed up and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off by the time i got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east so we struck for an island and hid the raft and sunk the skiff and turned in and slept like dead people illustration we turned in and slept illustration turning over the truck chapter xiv by and by when we got up we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck and found boots and blankets and clothes and all sorts of other things and a lot of books and a spyglass and three boxes of seegars we hadnt ever been this rich before in neither of our lives the seegars was prime we laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking and me reading the books and having a general good time i told jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat and i said these kinds of things was adventures but he said he didnt want no more adventures he said that when i went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died because he judged it was all up with him anyway it could be fixed for if he didnt get saved he would get drownded and if he did get saved whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward and then miss watson would sell him south sure well he was right he was most always right he had an uncommon level

a man you answer me dat i see it warnt no use wasting wordsyou cant learn a nigger to argue so i quit illustration we would sell the raft chapter xv we judged that three nights more would fetch us to cairo at the bottom of illinois where the ohio river comes in and that was what we was after we would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the ohio amongst the free states and then be out of trouble well the second night a fog begun to come on and we made for a towhead to tie to for it wouldnt do to try to run in a fog but when i paddled ahead in the canoe with the line to make fast there warnt anything but little saplings to tie to i passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank but there was a stiff current and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went i see the fog closing down and it made me so sick and scared i couldnt budge for most a half a minute it seemed to meand then there warnt no raft in sight you couldnt see twenty yards i jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke but she didnt come i was in such a hurry i hadnt untied her i got up and tried to untie her but i was so excited my hands shook so i couldnt hardly do anything with them as soon as i got started i took out after the raft hot and heavy right down the towhead that was all right as far as it went but the towhead warnt sixty yards long and the minute i flew by the foot of it i shot out into the solid white fog and hadnt no more idea which way i was going than a dead man thinks i it wont do to paddle first i know ill run into the bank or a towhead or something i got to set still and float and yet its mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time i whooped and listened away down there somewheres i hears a small whoop and up comes my spirits i went tearing after it listening sharp to hear it again the next time it come i see i warnt heading for it but heading away to the right of it and the next time i was heading away to the left of itand not gaining on it much either for i was flying around this way and that and tother but it was going straight ahead all the time i did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan and beat it all the time but he never did and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me well i fought along and directly i hears the whoop behind me i was tangled good now that was somebody elses whoop or else i was turned around i throwed the paddle down i heard the whoop again it was behind me yet but in a different place it kept coming and kept changing its place and i kept answering till by and by it was in front of me again and i knowed the current had swung the canoes head downstream and i was all right if that was jim and not some other raftsman hollering i couldnt tell nothing about voices in a fog for nothing dont look natural nor sound natural in a fog the whooping went on and in about a minute i come abooming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared the currrent was tearing by them so swift in another second or two it was solid white and still again i set perfectly still then listening to my heart thump and i reckon i didnt draw a breath while it thumped a hundred i just give up then i knowed what the matter was that cut bank was an island and jim had gone down tother side of it it warnt no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes it had the big timber of a regular island it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide i kept quiet with my ears cocked about fifteen minutes i reckon i was floating along of course four or five miles an hour but you dont ever think of that no you feel like you are laying dead still on the water and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you dont think to yourself how fast youre going but you catch your breath and think my how that snags tearing along if you think it aint dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night you try it onceyoull see illustration among the snacks next for about a half an hour i whoops now and then at last i hears the answer a long ways off and tries to follow it but i couldnt do it and directly i judged id got into a nest of towheads for i had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of mesometimes just a narrow channel between and some that i couldnt see i knowed was there because id hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks well i warnt long loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads and i only tried to chase them a little while anyway because it was worse than chasing a jackolantern you never knowed a sound dodge around so and swap places so quick and so much i had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times to keep from knocking the islands out of the river and so i judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearingit was floating a little faster than what i was well i seemed to be in the open river again by and by but i couldnt hear no sign of a whoop nowheres i reckoned jim had fetched up on a snag maybe and it was all up with him i was good and tired so i laid down in the canoe and said i wouldnt bother no more i didnt want to go to sleep of course but i was so sleepy i couldnt help it so i thought i would take jest one little catnap illustration asleep on the raft but i reckon it was more than a catnap for when i waked up the stars was shining bright the fog was all gone and i was spinning down a big bend stern first first i didnt know where i was i thought i was dreaming and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week it was a monstrous big river here with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks just a solid wall as well as i could see by the stars i looked away downstream and seen a black speck on the water i took after it but when i got to it it warnt nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together then i see another speck and chased that then another and this time i was right it was the raft when i got to it jim was setting there with his head down between his knees asleep with his right arm hanging over the steeringoar the other oar was smashed off and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt so shed had a rough time i made fast and laid down under jims nose on the raft and began to gap and stretch my fists out against jim and says hello jim have i been asleep why didnt you stir me up goodness gracious is dat you huck en you ain deadyou ain drowndedyous back agin its too good for true honey its too good for true lemme look at you chile lemme feel o you no you ain dead yous back agin live en soun jis de same ole huckde same ole huck thanks to goodness whats the matter with you jim you been adrinking drinkin has i ben adrinkin has i had a chance to be adrinkin well then what makes you talk so wild how does i talk wild how why haint you been talking about my coming back and all that stuff as if id been gone away huckhuck finn you look me in de eye look me in de eye haint you ben gone away gone away why what in the nation do you mean i haint been gone anywheres where would i go to well looky here boss deys sumfn wrong dey is is i me or who is i is i heah or whah is i now dats what i wants to know well i think youre here plain enough but i think youre a tangle headed old fool jim i is is i well you answer me dis didnt you tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas to de towhead no i didnt what towhead i haint see no towhead you haint seen no towhead looky here didnt de line pull loose en de raf go ahummin down de river en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog what fog why de fogde fog dats been aroun all night en didnt you whoop en didnt i whoop tell we got mix up in de islands en one un us got los en tother one was jis as good as los kase he didn know whah he wuz en didnt i bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos git drownded now ain dat so bossaint it so you answer me dat well this is too many for me jim i haint seen no fog nor no islands nor no troubles nor nothing i been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago and i reckon i done the same you couldnt a got drunk in that time so of course youve been dreaming dad fetch it how is i gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes well hang it all you did dream it because there didnt any of it happen but huck its all jis as plain to me as it dont make no difference how plain it is there aint nothing in it i know because ive been here all the time jim didnt say nothing for about five minutes but set there studying over it then he says well den i reckn i did dream it huck but dog my cats ef it aint de powerfullest dream i ever see en i haint ever had no dream bfo dats tired me like dis one oh well thats all right because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes but this one was a staving dream tell me all about it jim so jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through just as it happened only he painted it up considerable then he said he must start in and terpret it because it was sent for a warning he said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good but the current was another man that would get us away from him the whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then and if we didnt try hard to make out to understand them theyd just take us into bad luck stead of keeping us out of it the lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks but if we minded our business and didnt talk back and aggravate them we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river which was the free states and wouldnt have no more trouble it had clouded up pretty dark just after i got on to the raft but it was clearing up again now oh well thats all interpreted well enough as far as it goes jim i says but what does these things stand for it was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar you could see them firstrate now jim looked at the trash and then looked at me and back at the trash again he had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldnt seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away but when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling and says what do dey stan for ise gwyne to tell you when i got all wore out wid work en wid de callin for you en went to sleep my heart wuz mos broke bekase you wuz los en i didn kyer no mo what become er me en de raf en when i wake up en fine you back agin all safe en soun de tears come en i could a got down on my knees en kiss yo foot is so thankful en all you wuz thinkin bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole jim wid a lie dat truck dah is trash en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey frens en makes em ashamed then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam and went in there without saying anything but that but that was enough it made me feel so mean i could almost kissed his foot to get him to take it back it was fifteen minutes before i could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger but i done it and i warnt ever sorry for it afterwards neither i didnt do him no more mean tricks and i wouldnt done that one if id a knowed it would make him feel that way illustration it amounted to something being a raftsman chapter xvi we slept most all day and started out at night a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession she had four long sweeps at each end so we judged she carried as many as thirty men likely she had five big wigwams aboard wide apart and an open camp fire in the middle and a tall flagpole at each end there was a power of style about her it amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that we went drifting down into a big bend and the night clouded up and got hot the river was very wide and was walled with solid timber on both sides you couldnt see a break in it hardly ever or a light we talked about cairo and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it i said likely we wouldnt because i had heard say there warnt but about a dozen houses there and if they didnt happen to have them lit up how was we going to know we was passing a town jim said if the two big rivers joined together there that would show but i said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again that disturbed jimand me too so the question was what to do i said paddle ashore the first time a light showed and tell them pap was behind coming along with a tradingscow and was a green hand at the business and wanted to know how far it was to cairo jim thought it was a good idea so we took a smoke on it and waited there warnt nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town and not pass it without seeing it he said hed be mighty sure to see it because hed be a free man the minute he seen it but if he missed it hed be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom every little while he jumps up and says dah she is but it warnt it was jackolanterns or lightning bugs so he set down again and went to watching same as before jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom well i can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish too to hear him because i begun to get it through my head that he was most freeand who was to blame for it why me i couldnt get that out of my conscience no how nor no way it got to troubling me so i couldnt rest i couldnt stay still in one place it hadnt ever come home to me before what this thing was that i was doing but now it did and it stayed with me and scorched me more and more i tried to make out to myself that i warnt to blame because i didnt run jim off from his rightful owner but it warnt no use conscience up and says every time but you knowed he was running for his freedom and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody that was soi couldnt get around that noway that was where it pinched conscience says to me what had poor miss watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word what did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean why she tried to learn you your book she tried to learn you your manners she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how thats what she done i got to feeling so mean and so miserable i most wished i was dead i fidgeted up and down the raft abusing myself to myself and jim was fidgeting up and down past me we neither of us could keep still every time he danced around and says dahs cairo it went through me like a shot and i thought if it was cairo i reckoned i would die of miserableness jim talked out loud all the time while i was talking to myself he was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent and when he got enough he would buy his wife which was owned on a farm close to where miss watson lived and then they would both work to buy the two children and if their master wouldnt sell them theyd get an ablitionist to go and steal them it most froze me to hear such talk he wouldnt ever dared to talk such talk in his life before just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free it was according to the old saying give a nigger an inch and hell take an ell thinks i this is what comes of my not thinking here was this nigger which i had as good as helped to run away coming right out flatfooted and saying he would steal his childrenchildren that belonged to a man i didnt even know a man that hadnt ever done me no harm i was sorry to hear jim say that it was such a lowering of him my conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever until at last i says to it let up on meit aint too late yetill paddle ashore at the first light and tell i felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off all my troubles was gone i went to looking out sharp for a light and sort of singing to myself by and by one showed jim sings out wes safe huck wes safe jump up and crack yo heels dats de good ole cairo at las i jis knows it i says ill take the canoe and go and see jim it mightnt be you know he jumped and got the canoe ready and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on and give me the paddle and as i shoved off he says pooty soon ill be ashoutn for joy en ill say its all on accounts o huck is a free man en i couldnt ever ben free ef it hadn ben for huck huck done it jim wont ever forgit you huck yous de bes fren jims ever had en yous de only fren ole jims got now i was paddling off all in a sweat to tell on him but when he says this it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me i went along slow then and i warnt right down certain whether i was glad i started or whether i warnt when i was fifty yards off jim says dah you goes de ole true huck de ony white genlman dat ever kep his promise to ole jim well i just felt sick but i says i got to do iti cant get out of it right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns and they stopped and i stopped one of them says whats that yonder a piece of a raft i says do you belong on it yes sir any men on it only one sir well theres five niggers run off tonight up yonder above the head of the bend is your man white or black i didnt answer up prompt i tried to but the words wouldnt come i tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it but i warnt man enoughhadnt the spunk of a rabbit i see i was weakening so i just give up trying and up and says hes white i reckon well go and see for ourselves i wish you would says i because its pap thats there and maybe youd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is hes sickand so is mam and mary ann oh the devil were in a hurry boy but i spose weve got to come buckle to your paddle and lets get along i buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars when we had made a stroke or two i says papll be mighty much obleeged to you i can tell you everybody goes away when i want them to help me tow the raft ashore and i cant do it by myself well thats infernal mean odd too say boy whats the matter with your father its theathewell it aint anything much they stopped pulling it warnt but a mighty little ways to the raft now one says boy thats a lie what is the matter with your pap answer up square now and itll be the better for you illustration boy thats a lie i will sir i will honestbut dont leave us please its

looard confound it i just expect the wind has blowed it to us your paps got the smallpox and you know it precious well why didnt you come out and say so do you want to spread it all over well says i

here ill tell you what to do dont you try to land by yourself or youll smash everything to pieces you float along down about twenty miles and youll come to a town on the lefthand side of the river it will be long after sunup then and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever dont be a fool again and let people guess what is the matter now were trying to do you a kindness so you just put twenty miles between us thats a good boy it wouldnt do any good to land yonder where the light isits only a woodyard say i reckon your fathers poor and im bound to say

niggers you get help and nab them and you can make some money by it goodbye sir says i i wont let no runaway niggers get by me if i can help it they went off and i got aboard the raft feeling bad and low because i knowed very well i had done wrong and i see it warnt no use for me to try to learn to do right a body that dont get started right when hes little aint got no showwhen the pinch comes there aint nothing to back him up and keep him to his work and so he gets beat then i thought a minute and says to myself hold on spose youd a done right and give jim up would you felt better than what you do now no says i id feel badid feel just the same way i do now well then says i whats the use you learning to do right when its troublesome to do right and aint no trouble to do wrong and the wages is just the same i was stuck i couldnt answer that so i reckoned i wouldnt bother no more about it but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time i went into the wigwam jim warnt there i looked all around he warnt anywhere i says jim here i is huck is dey out o sight yit dont talk loud illustration here i is huck he was in the river under the stern oar with just his nose out i told him they were out of sight so he come aboard he says i was alistenin to all de talk en i slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho if dey come aboard den i was gwyne to swim to de raf agin when dey was gone but lawsy how you did fool em huck dat wuz de smartes dodge i tell you chile ispec it save ole jimole jim aint going to forgit you for dat honey then we talked about the money it was a pretty good raisetwenty dollars apiece jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free states he said twenty mile more warnt far for the raft to go but he wished we was already there towards daybreak we tied up and jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good then he worked all day fixing things in bundles and getting all ready to quit rafting that night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a lefthand bend i went off in the canoe to ask about it pretty soon i found a man out in the river with a skiff setting a trotline i ranged up and says mister is that town cairo cairo no you must be a blame fool what town is it mister if you want to know go and find out if you stay here botherin around me for about a half a minute longer youll get something you wont want i paddled to the raft jim was awful disappointed but i said never mind cairo would be the next place i reckoned we passed another town before daylight and i was going out again but it was high ground so i didnt go no high ground about cairo jim said i had forgot it we laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the lefthand bank i begun to suspicion something so did jim i says maybe we went by cairo in the fog that night he says doan les talk about it huck po niggers cant have no luck i awluz spected dat rattlesnakeskin warnt done wid its work i wish id never seen that snakeskin jimi do wish id never laid eyes on it it aint yo fault huck you didn know dont you blame yoself bout it when it was daylight here was the clear ohio water inshore sure enough and outside was the old regular muddy so it was all up with cairo we talked it all over it wouldnt do to take to the shore we couldnt take the raft up the stream of course there warnt no way but to wait for dark and start back in the canoe and take the chances so we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket so as to be fresh for the work and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone we didnt say a word for a good while there warnt anything to say we both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake skin so what was the use to talk about it it would only look like we was finding fault and that would be bound to fetch more bad luckand keep on fetching it too till we knowed enough to keep still by and by we talked about what we better do and found there warnt no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in we warnt going to borrow it when there warnt anybody around the way pap would do for that might set people after us so we shoved out after dark on the raft anybody that dont believe yet that its foolishness to handle a snake skin after all that that snakeskin done for us will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us the place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore but we didnt see no rafts laying up so we went along during three hours and more well the night got gray and ruther thick which is the next meanest thing to fog you cant tell the shape of the river and you cant see no distance it got to be very late and still and then along comes a steamboat up the river we lit the lantern and judged she would see it upstream boats didnt generly come close to us they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river we could hear her pounding along but we didnt see her good till she was close she aimed right for us often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs and thinks hes mighty smart well here she comes and we said she was going to try and shave us but she didnt seem to be sheering off a bit she was a big one and she was coming in a hurry too looking like a black cloud with rows of glowworms around it but all of a sudden she bulged out big and scary with a long row of wideopen furnace doors shining like redhot teeth and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us there was a yell at us and a jingling of bells to stop the engines a powwow of cussing and whistling of steamand as jim went overboard on one side and i on the other she come smashing straight through the raft i divedand i aimed to find the bottom too for a thirtyfoot wheel had got to go over me and i wanted it to have plenty of room i could always stay under water a minute this time i reckon i stayed under a minute and a half then i bounced for the top in a hurry for i was nearly busting i popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose and puffed a bit of course there was a booming current and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them for they never cared much for raftsmen so now she was churning along up the river out of sight in the thick weather though i could hear her i sung out for jim about a dozen times but i didnt get any answer so i grabbed a plank that touched me while i was treading water and struck out for shore shoving it ahead of me but i made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the lefthand shore which meant that i was in a crossing so i changed off and went that way it was one of these long slanting twomile crossings so i was a good long time in getting over i made a safe landing and clumb up the bank i couldnt see but a little ways but i went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more and then i run across a big oldfashioned double loghouse before i noticed it i was going to rush by and get away but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me and i knowed better than to move another peg illustration climbing up the bank illustration whos there chapter xvii in about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without

pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said there thats enoughput your head in i done it but i judged they would take it off the candle was on the floor and there they all was looking at me and me at them for about a quarter of a minute three big men with guns pointed at me which made me wince i tell you the oldest gray and about sixty the other two thirty or moreall of them fine and handsomeand the sweetest old grayheaded lady and back of her two young women which i couldnt see right well the old gentleman says there i reckon its all right come in as soon as i was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it and told the young men to come in with their guns and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windowsthere warnt none on the side they held the candle and took a good look at me and all said why he aint a shepherdsonno there aint any shepherdson about him then the old man said he hoped i wouldnt mind being searched for arms because he didnt mean no harm by itit was only to make sure so he didnt pry into my pockets but only felt outside with his hands and said it was all right he told me to make myself easy and at home and tell all about myself but the old lady says why bless you saul the poor things as wet as he can be and dont you reckon it may be hes hungry true for you racheli forgot so the old lady says betsy this was a nigger woman you fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can poor thing and one of you

methirteen or fourteen or along there though he was a little bigger than me he hadnt on anything but a shirt and he was very frowzyheaded he came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes and he was dragging a gun along with the other one he says illustration buck aint they no shepherdsons around they said no twas a false alarm well he says if theyd a ben some i reckon id a got one they all

woods day before yesterday and he asked me where moses was when the candle went out i said i didnt know i hadnt heard about it before no way well guess he says howm i going to guess says i when i

ma she makes me confound these ole britches i reckon id better put em on but id ruther not its so warm are you all ready all right come along old hoss cold cornpone cold cornbeef butter and buttermilkthat is what they had for me down there and there aint nothing better that ever ive come across yet buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes except the nigger woman which was gone and the two young women they all smoked and talked and i eat and talked the young women had quilts around them and their hair down their backs they all asked me questions and i told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of arkansaw and my sister mary ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more and bill went to hunt them and he warnt heard of no more and tom and mort died and then there warnt nobody but just me and pap left and he was just trimmed down to nothing on account of his troubles so when he died i took what there was left because the farm didnt belong to us and started up the river deck passage and fell overboard and that was how i come to be here so they said i could have a home there as long as i wanted it then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed and i went to bed with buck and when i waked up in the morning drat it all i had forgot what my name was so i laid there about an hour trying to think and when buck waked up i says can you spell buck yes he says i bet you cant spell my name says i i bet you what you dare i can says he all right says i go ahead george jaxonthere now he says well says i you done it but i didnt think you could it aint no slouch of a name to spellright off without studying i set it down private because somebody might want me to spell it next and so i wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like i was used to it it was a mighty nice family and a mighty nice house too i hadnt seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style it didnt have an iron latch on the front door nor a wooden one with a buckskin string but a brass knob to turn the same as houses in town there warnt no bed in the parlor nor a sign of a bed but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them there was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick sometimes they wash them over with red waterpaint that they call spanishbrown same as they do in town they had big brass dogirons that could hold up a sawlog there was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front and a round place in the middle of it for the sun and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it it was beautiful to hear that clock tick and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out they wouldnt took any money for her well there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock made out of something like chalk and painted up gaudy by one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery and a crockery dog by the other and when you pressed down on them they squeaked but didnt open their mouths nor look different nor interested they squeaked through underneath there was a couple of big wildturkeywing fans spread out behind those things on the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is but they warnt real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk or whatever it was underneath this table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth with a red and blue spreadeagle painted on it and a painted border all around it come all the way from philadelphia they said there was some books too piled up perfectly exact on each corner of the table one was a big family bible full of pictures one was pilgrims progress about a man that left his family it didnt say why i read considerable in it now and then the statements was interesting but tough another was friendships offering full of beautiful stuff and poetry but i didnt read the poetry another was henry clays speeches and another was dr gunns family medicine which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead there was a hymn book and a lot of other books and there was nice splitbottom chairs and perfectly sound toonot bagged down in the middle and busted like an old basket they had pictures hung on the wallsmainly washingtons and lafayettes and battles and highland marys and one called signing the declaration there was some that they called crayons which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old they was different from any pictures i ever see beforeblacker mostly than is common one was a woman in a slim black dress belted small under the armpits with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves and a large black scoopshovel bonnet with a black veil and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape and very wee black slippers like a chisel and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow under a weeping willow and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule and underneath the picture it said shall i never see thee more alas another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head and knotted there in front of a comb like a chairback and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up and underneath the picture it said i shall never hear thy sweet chirrup more alas there was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon and tears running down her cheeks and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth and underneath the picture it said and art thou gone yes thou art gone alas these was all nice pictures i reckon but i didnt somehow seem to take to them because if ever i was down a little they always give me the fantods everybody was sorry she died because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost but i reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard she was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done but she never got the chance it was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off with her hair all down her back and looking up to the moon with the tears running down her face and she had two arms folded across her breast and two arms stretched out in front and two more reaching up towards the moonand the idea was to see which pair would look best and then scratch out all the other arms but as i was saying she died before she got her mind made up and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it other times it was hid with a little curtain the young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery seemed to me illustration it made her look spidery illustration they got him out and empied him this young girl kept a scrapbook when she was alive and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the presbyterian observer and write poetry after them out of her own head it was very good poetry this is what she wrote about a boy by the name of stephen dowling bots that fell down a well and was drownded ode to stephen dowling bots decd and did young stephen sicken and did young stephen die and did the sad hearts thicken and did the mourners cry no such was not the fate of young stephen dowling bots though sad hearts round him thickened twas not from sickness shots no whoopingcough did rack his frame nor measles drear with spots not these impaired the sacred name of stephen dowling bots despised love struck not with woe that head of curly knots nor stomach troubles laid him low young stephen dowling bots o no then list with tearful eye whilst i his fate do tell his soul did from this cold world fly by falling down a well they got him out and emptied him alas it was too late his spirit was gone for to sport aloft in the realms of the good and great if emmeline grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen there aint no telling what she could a done by and by buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing she didnt ever have to stop to think he said she would slap down a line and if she couldnt find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one and go ahead she warnt particular she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful every time a man died or a woman died or a child died she would be on hand with her tribute before he was cold she called them tributes the neighbors said it was the doctor first then emmeline then the undertakerthe undertaker never got in ahead of emmeline but once and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead persons name which was whistler she warnt ever the same after that she never complained but she kinder pined away and did not live long poor thing manys the time i made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrapbook and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and i had soured on her a little i liked all that family dead ones and all and warnt going to let anything come between us poor emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive and it didnt seem right that there warnt nobody to make some about her now she was gone so i tried to sweat out a verse or two myself but i couldnt seem to make it go somehow they kept emmelines room trim and nice and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive and nobody ever slept there the old lady took care of the room herself though there was plenty of niggers and she sewed there a good deal and read her bible there mostly well as i was saying about the parlor there was beautiful curtains on the windows white with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls and cattle coming down to drink there was a little old piano too that had tin pans in it i reckon and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing the last link is broken and play the battle of prague on it the walls of all the rooms was plastered and most had carpets on the floors and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside it was a double house and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day and it was a cool comfortable place nothing couldnt be better and warnt the cooking good and just bushels of it too illustration the house illustration col grangerford chapter xviii col grangerford was a gentleman you see he was a gentleman all over and so was his family he was well born as the saying is and thats worth as much in a man as it is in a horse so the widow douglas said and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town and pap he always said it too though he warnt no more quality than a mudcat himself col grangerford was very tall and very slim and had a darkishpaly complexion not a sign of red in it anywheres he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face and he had the thinnest kind of lips and the thinnest kind of nostrils and a high nose and heavy eyebrows and the blackest kind of eyes sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you as you may say his forehead was high and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders his hands was long and thin and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it and on sundays he wore a blue tailcoat with brass buttons on it he carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it there warnt no frivolishness about him not a bit and he warnt ever loud he was as kind as he could beyou could feel that you know and so you had confidence sometimes he smiled and it was good to see but when he straightened himself up like a libertypole and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows you wanted to climb a tree first and find out what the matter was afterwards he didnt ever have to tell anybody to mind their mannerseverybody was always goodmannered where he was everybody loved to have him around too he was sunshine most alwaysi mean he made it seem like good weather when he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute and that was enough there wouldnt nothing go wrong again for a week when him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them goodday and didnt set down again till they had set down then tom and bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him and he held it in his hand and waited till toms and bobs was mixed and then they bowed and said our duty to you sir and madam and they bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you and so they drank all three and bob and tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers and give it to me and buck and we drank to the old people too bob was the oldest and tom nexttall beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces and long black hair and black eyes they dressed in white linen from head to foot like the old gentleman and wore broad panama hats then there was miss charlotte she was twentyfive and tall and proud and grand but as good as she could be when she warnt stirred up but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks like her father she was beautiful so was her sister miss sophia but it was a different kind she was gentle and sweet like a dove and she was only twenty each person had their own nigger to wait on thembuck too my nigger had a monstrous easy time because i warnt used to having anybody do anything for me but bucks was on the jump most of the time this was all there was of the family now but there used to be morethree sons they got killed and emmeline that died the old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers sometimes a stack of people would come there horseback from ten or fifteen mile around and stay five or six days and have such junketings round about and on the river and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes and balls at the house nights these people was mostly kinfolks of the family the men brought their guns with them it was a handsome lot of quality i tell you there was another clan of aristocracy around therefive or six familiesmostly of the name of shepherdson they was as hightoned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of grangerfords the shepherdsons and grangerfords used the same steamboat landing which was about two mile above our house so sometimes when i went up there with a lot of our folks i used to see a lot of the shepherdsons there on their fine horses one day buck and me was away out in the woods hunting and heard a horse coming we was crossing the road buck says quick jump for the woods illustration young harney shepherdson we done it and then peeped down the woods through the leaves pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier he had his gun across his pommel i had seen him before it was young harney shepherdson i heard bucks gun go off at my ear and harneys hat tumbled off from his head he grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid but we didnt wait we started through the woods on a run the woods warnt thick so i looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet and twice i seen harney cover buck with his gun and then he rode away the way he cometo get his hat i reckon but i couldnt see we never stopped running till we got home the old gentlemans eyes blazed a minutetwas pleasure mainly i judgedthen his face sort of smoothed down and he says kind of gentle i dont like that shooting from behind a bush why didnt you step into the road my boy the shepherdsons dont father they always take advantage miss charlotte she held her head up like a queen while buck was telling his tale and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped the two young men looked dark but never said nothing miss sophia she turned pale but the color come back when she found the man warnt hurt illustration miss charlotte soon as i could get buck down by the corncribs under the trees by ourselves i says did you want to kill him buck well i bet i did what did he do to you him he never done nothing to me well then what did you want to kill him for why nothingonly its on account of the feud whats a feud why where was you raised dont you know what a feud is never heard of it beforetell me about it well says buck a feud is this way a man has a quarrel with another man and kills him then that other mans brother kills him then the other brothers on both sides goes for one another then the cousins chip inand by and by everybodys killed off and there aint no more feud but its kind of slow and takes a long time has this one been going on long buck well i should reckon it started thirty year ago or somers along there there was trouble bout something and then a lawsuit to settle it and the suit went agin one of the men and so he up and shot the man that won the suitwhich he would naturally do of course anybody would what was the trouble about buckland i reckon maybei dont know well who done the shooting was it a grangerford or a shepherdson laws how do i know it was so long ago dont anybody know oh yes pa knows i reckon and some of the other old people but they dont know now what the row was about in the first place has there been many killed buck yes right smart chance of funerals but they dont always kill pas got a few buckshot in him but he dont mind it cuz he dont weigh much anyway bobs been carved up some with a bowie and toms been hurt once or twice has anybody been killed this year buck yes we got one and they got one bout three months ago my cousin bud fourteen year old was riding through the woods on tother side of the river and didnt have no weapon with him which was blame foolishness and in a lonesome place he hears a horse acoming behind him and sees old baldy shepherdson alinkin after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair aflying in the wind and stead of jumping off and taking to the brush bud lowed he could outrun him so they had it nip and tuck for five mile or more the old man againing all the time so at last bud seen it warnt any use so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front you know and the old man he rode up and shot him down but he didnt git much chance to enjoy his luck for inside of a week our folks laid him out i reckon that old man was a coward buck i reckon he warnt a coward not by a blame sight there aint a coward amongst them shepherdsonsnot a one and there aint no cowards amongst the grangerfords either why that old man kep up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three grangerfords and come out winner they was all ahorseback he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile and kep his horse before him to stop the bullets but the grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man and peppered away at him and he peppered away at them him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled but the grangerfords had to be fetched homeand one of em was dead and another died the next day no sir if a bodys out hunting for cowards he dont want to fool away any time amongst them shepherdsons becuz they dont breed any of that kind next sunday we all went to church about three mile everybody ahorseback the men took their guns along so did buck and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall the shepherdsons done the same it was pretty ornery preachingall about brotherly love and suchlike tiresomeness but everybody said it was a good sermon and they all talked it over going home and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination and i dont know what all that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest sundays i had run across yet about an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around some in their chairs and some in their rooms and it got to be pretty dull buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep i went up to our room and judged i would take a nap myself i found that sweet miss sophia standing in her door which was next to ours and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft and asked me if i liked her and i said i did and she asked me if i would do something for her and not tell anybody and i said i would then she said shed forgot her testament and left it in the seat at church between two other books and would i slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her and not say nothing to nobody i said i would so i slid out and slipped off up the road and there warnt anybody at the church except maybe a hog or two for there warnt any lock on the door and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summertime because its cool if you notice most folks dont go to church only when theyve got to but a hog is different illustration and asked me if i liked her says i to myself somethings up it aint natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a testament so i give it a shake and out drops a little piece of paper with halfpast two wrote on it with a pencil i ransacked it but couldnt find anything else i couldnt make anything out of that so i put the paper in the book again and when i got home and upstairs there was miss sophia in her door waiting for me she pulled me in and shut the door then she looked in the testament till she found the paper and as soon as she read it she looked glad and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze and said i was the best boy in the world and not to tell anybody she was mighty red in the face for a minute and her eyes lighted up and it made her powerful pretty i was a good deal astonished but when i got my breath i asked her what the paper was about and she asked me if i had read it and i said no and she asked me if i could read writing and i told her no only coarsehand and then she said the paper warnt anything but a bookmark to keep her place and i might go and play now i went off down to the river studying over this thing and pretty soon i noticed that my nigger was following along behind when we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second and then comes arunning and says mars jawge if youll come down into de swamp ill show you a whole stack o watermoccasins thinks i thats mighty curious he said that yesterday he oughter know a body dont love watermoccasins enough to go around hunting for them what is he up to anyway so i says all right trot ahead i followed a half a mile then he struck out over the swamp and waded ankle deep as much as another halfmile we come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines and he says you shove right in dah jist a few steps mars jawge dahs whah dey is is seed m befo i dont kyer to see em no mo then he slopped right along and went away and pretty soon the trees hid him i poked into the place aways and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines and found a man laying there asleepand by jings it was my old jim i waked him up and i reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to see me again but it warnt he nearly cried he was so glad but he warnt surprised said he swum along behind me that night and heard me yell every time but dasnt answer because he didnt want

as hard as i could put by and by i begin to hear guns a good ways off when i come in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands i worked along under the trees and brush till i got to a good place and then i clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach and watched there was a wood rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree and first i was going to hide behind that but maybe it was luckier i didnt there was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store cussing and yelling and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the woodrank alongside of the steamboat landing but they couldnt come it every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at the two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile so they could watch both ways illustration behind the woodpile by and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling they started riding towards the store then up gets one of the boys draws a steady bead over the woodrank and drops one of them out of his saddle all the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store and that minute the two boys started on the run they got half way to the tree i was in before the men noticed then the men see them and jumped on their horses and took out after them they gained on the boys but it didnt do no good the boys had too good a start they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree and slipped in behind it and so they had the bulge on the men again one of the boys was buck and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old the men ripped around awhile and then rode away as soon as they was out of sight i sung out to buck and told him he didnt know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first he was awful surprised he told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again said they was up to some devilment or otherwouldnt be gone long i wished i was out of that tree but i dasnt come down buck begun to cry and rip and lowed that him and his cousin joe that was the other young chap would make up for this day yet he said his father and his two brothers was killed and two or three of the enemy said the shepherdsons laid for them in ambush buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relationsthe shepherdsons was too strong for them i asked him what was become of young harney and miss sophia he said theyd got across the river and was safe i was glad of that but the way buck did take on because he didnt manage to kill harney that day he shot at himi haint ever heard anything like it all of a sudden bang bang bang goes three or four gunsthe men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses the boys jumped for the riverboth of them hurtand as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out kill them kill them it made me so sick i most fell out of the tree i aint agoing to tell all that happenedit would make me sick again if i was to do that i wished i hadnt ever come ashore that night to see such things i aint ever going to get shut of themlots of times i dream about them i stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark afraid to come down sometimes i heard guns away off in the woods and twice i seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns so i reckoned the trouble was still agoing on i was mighty downhearted so i made up my mind i wouldnt ever go anear that house again because i reckoned i was to blame somehow i judged that that piece of paper meant that miss sophia was to meet harney somewheres at halfpast two and run off and i judged i ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted and then maybe he would a locked her up and this awful mess wouldnt ever happened when i got down out of the tree i crept along down the river bank a piece and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water and tugged at them till i got them ashore then i covered up their faces and got away as quick as i could i cried a little when i was covering up bucks face for he was mighty good to me it was just dark now i never went near the house but struck through the woods and made for the swamp jim warnt on his island so i tramped off in a hurry for the crick and crowded through the willows redhot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country the raft was gone my souls but i was scared i couldnt get my breath for most a minute then i raised a yell a voice not twentyfive foot from me says good lan is dat you honey doan make no noise it was jims voicenothing ever sounded so good before i run along the bank a piece and got aboard and jim he grabbed me and hugged me he was so glad to see me he says laws bless you chile i uz right down sho yous dead agin jacks been heah he say he reckn yous ben shot kase you didn come home no mo so is jes dis minute a startin de raf down towards de mouf er de crick sos to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as jack comes agin en tells me for certain you is dead lawsy is mighty glad to git you back again honey i says all rightthats mighty good they wont find me and theyll think ive been killed and floated down the rivertheres something up there that ll help them think soso dont you lose no time jim but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can i never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the mississippi then we hung up our signal lantern and judged that we was free and safe once more i hadnt had a bite to eat since yesterday so jim he got out some corndodgers and buttermilk and pork and cabbage and greensthere aint nothing in the world so good when its cooked rightand whilst i eat my supper we talked and had a good time i was powerful glad to get away from the feuds and so was jim to get away from the swamp we said there warnt no home like a raft after all other places do seem so cramped up and smothery but a raft dont you feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft illustration hiding daytimes chapter xix two or three days and nights went by i reckon i might say they swum by they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely here is the way we put in the time it was a monstrous big river down theresometimes a mile and a half wide we run nights and laid up and hid daytimes soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied upnearly always in the dead water under a towhead and then cut young cottonwoods and willows and hid the raft with them then we set out the lines next we slid into the river and had a swim so as to freshen up and cool off then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep and watched the daylight come not a sound anywheresperfectly stilljust like the whole world was asleep only sometimes the bullfrogs acluttering maybe the first thing to see looking away over the water was a kind of dull linethat was the woods on tother side you couldnt make nothing else out then a pale place in the sky then more paleness spreading around then the river softened up away off and warnt black any more but gray you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far awaytrading scows and such things and long black streaksrafts sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking or jumbled up voices it was so still and sounds come so far and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that theres a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way and you see the mist curl up off of the water and the east reddens up and the river and you make out a logcabin in the edge of the woods away on the bank on tother side of the river being a woodyard likely and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres then the nice breeze springs up and comes fanning you from over there so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers but sometimes not that way because theyve left dead fish laying around gars and such and they do get pretty rank and next youve got the full day and everything smiling in the sun and the songbirds just going it a little smoke couldnt be noticed now so we would take some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast and afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river and kind of lazy along and by and by lazy off to sleep wake up by and by and look to see what done it and maybe see a steamboat coughing along upstream so far off towards the other side you couldnt tell nothing about her only whether she was a sternwheel or sidewheel then for about an hour there wouldnt be nothing to hear nor nothing to seejust solid lonesomeness next youd see a raft sliding by away off yonder and maybe a galoot on it chopping because theyre most always doing it on a raft youd see the axe flash and come down you dont hear nothing you see that axe go up again and by the time its above the mans head then you hear the kchunkit had took all that time to come over the water so we would put in the day lazying around listening to the stillness once there was a thick fog and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldnt run over them a scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughingheard them plain but we couldnt see no sign of them it made you feel crawly it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air jim said he believed it was spirits but i says no spirits wouldnt say dern the dern fog soon as it was night out we shoved when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone and let her float wherever the current wanted her to then we lit the pipes and dangled our legs in the water and talked about all kinds of thingswe was always naked day and night whenever the mosquitoes would let usthe new clothes bucks folks made for me was too good to be comfortable and besides i didnt go much on clothes nohow sometimes wed have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time yonder was the banks and the islands across the water and maybe a sparkwhich was a candle in a cabin window and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or twoon a raft or a scow you know and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts its lovely to live on a raft we had the sky up there all speckled with stars and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened jim he allowed they was made but i allowed they happened i judged it would have took too long to make so many jim said the moon could a laid them well that looked kind of reasonable so i didnt say nothing against it because ive seen a frog lay most as many so of course it could be done we used to watch the stars that fell too and see them streak down jim allowed theyd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again and by and by her waves would get to us a long time after she was gone and joggle the raft a bit and after that you wouldnt hear nothing for you couldnt tell how long except maybe frogs or something after midnight the people on shore went to bed and then for two or three hours the shores was blackno more sparks in the cabin windows these sparks was our clockthe first one that showed again meant morning was coming so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away one morning about daybreak i found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shoreit was only two hundred yardsand paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods to see if i couldnt get some berries just as i was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it i thought i was a goner for whenever anybody was after anybody i judged it was meor maybe jim i was about to dig out from there in a hurry but they was pretty close to me then and sung out and begged me to save their livessaid they hadnt been doing nothing and was being chased for itsaid there was men and dogs acoming they wanted to jump right in but i says illustration and dogs acoming dont you do it i dont hear the dogs and horses yet youve got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways then you take to the water and wade down to me and get inthatll throw the dogs off the scent they done it and soon as they was aboard i lit out for our towhead and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off shouting we heard them come along towards the crick but couldnt see them they seemed to stop and fool around a while then as we got further and further away all the time we couldnt hardly hear them at all by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river everything was quiet and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe one of these fellows was about seventy or upwards and had a bald head and very gray whiskers he had an old batteredup slouch hat on and a greasy blue woollen shirt and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boottops and homeknit gallusesno he only had one he had an old longtailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm and both of them had big fat rattylooking carpetbags the other fellow was about thirty and dressed about as ornery after breakfast we all laid off and talked and the first thing that come out was that these chaps didnt know one another what got you into trouble says the baldhead to tother chap well id been selling an article to take the tartar off the teethand it does take it off too and generly the enamel along with itbut i stayed about one night longer than i ought to and was just in the act of sliding out when i ran across you on the trail this side of town and you told me they were coming and begged me to help you to

nobody never said anything for a while then the young man hove a sigh and says alas what re you alassin about says the baldhead to think i should have lived to be leading such a life and be degraded down into such company and he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag dern your skin aint the company good enough for you says the baldhead pretty pert and uppish yes it is good enough for me its as good as i deserve for who fetched me so low when i was so high i did myself i dont blame you gentlemenfar from it i dont blame anybody i deserve it all let the cold world do its worst one thing

it to you for i feel i may have confidence in you by rights i am a duke illustration by rights i am a duke jims eyes bugged out when he heard that and i reckon mine did too then the baldhead says no you cant mean it yes my greatgrandfather eldest son of the duke of bridgewater fled to this country about the end of the last century to breathe the pure air of freedom married here and died leaving a son his own father dying about the same time the second son of the late duke seized the titles and estatesthe infant real duke was ignored i am the lineal descendant of that infanti am the rightful duke of bridgewater and here am i forlorn torn from my high estate hunted of men despised by the cold world ragged worn heartbroken and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft jim pitied him ever so much and so did i we tried to comfort him but he said it warnt much use he couldnt be much comforted said if we was a mind to acknowledge him that would do him more good than most anything else so we said we would if he would tell us how he said we ought to bow when we spoke to him and say your grace or my lord or your lordshipand he wouldnt mind it if we called him plain bridgewater which he said was a title anyway and not a name and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner and do any little thing for him he wanted done well that was all easy so we done it all through dinner jim stood around and waited on him and says will yo grace have some o dis or some o dat and so on and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him but the old man got pretty silent by and bydidnt have much to say and didnt look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke he seemed to have something on his mind so along in the afternoon he says looky here bilgewater he says im nation sorry for you but you aint the only person thats had troubles like that no no you aint you aint the only person thats ben snaked down wrongfully outn a high place alas no you aint the only person thats had a secret of his birth and by jings he begins to cry hold what do you mean bilgewater kin i trust you says the old man still sort of sobbing to the bitter death he took the old man by the hand and squeezed it and says that secret of your being speak bilgewater i am the late dauphin illustration i am the late dauphin you bet you jim and me stared this time then the duke says you are what yes my friend it is too trueyour eyes is lookin at this very moment on the pore disappeared dauphin looy the seventeen son of looy the sixteen and marry antonette you at your age no you mean youre the late charlemagne you must be six or seven hundred years old at the very least trouble has done it bilgewater trouble has done it trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude yes gentlemen you see before you in blue jeans and misery the wanderin exiled trampled on and sufferin rightful king of france well he cried and took on so that me and jim didnt know hardly what to do we was so sorryand so glad and proud wed got him with us too so we set in like we done before with the duke and tried to comfort him but he said it warnt no use nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights and got down on one knee to speak to him and always called him your majesty and waited on him first at meals and didnt set down in his presence till he asked them so jim and me set to majestying him and doing this and that and tother for him and standing up till he told us we might set down this done him heaps of good and so he got cheerful and comfortable but the duke kind of soured on him and didnt look a bit satisfied with the way things was going still the king acted real friendly towards him and said the dukes greatgrandfather and all the other dukes of bilgewater was a good deal thought of by his father and was allowed to come to the palace considerable but the duke stayed huffy a good while till by and by the king says like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this hyer raft bilgewater and so whats the use o your bein sour it ll only make things oncomfortable it aint my fault i warnt born a duke it aint your fault you warnt born a kingso whats the use to worry make the best o things the way you find em says ithats my motto this aint no bad thing that weve struck hereplenty grub and an easy lifecome give us your hand duke and les all be friends the duke done it and jim and me was pretty glad to see it it took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft for what you want above all things on a raft is for everybody to be satisfied and feel right and kind towards the others it didnt take me long to make up my mind that these liars warnt no kings nor dukes at all but just lowdown humbugs and frauds but i never said nothing never let on kept it to myself its the best way then you dont have no quarrels and dont get into no trouble if they wanted us to call them kings and dukes i hadnt no objections long as it would keep peace in the family and it warnt no use to tell jim so i didnt tell him if i never learnt nothing else out of pap i learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way illustration tail piece illustration on the raft chapter xx they asked us considerable many questions wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for and laid by in the daytime instead of runningwas jim a runaway nigger says i goodness sakes would a runaway nigger run south no they allowed he wouldnt i had to account for things some way so i says my folks was living in pike county in missouri where i was born and they all died off but me and pa and my brother ike pa he lowed hed break up and go down and live with uncle ben whos got a little one horse place on the river fortyfour mile below orleans pa was pretty poor and had some debts so when hed squared up there warnt nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger jim that warnt enough to take us fourteen hundred mile deck passage nor no other way well when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day he ketched this piece of a raft so we reckoned wed go down to orleans on it pas luck didnt hold out a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel jim and me come up all right but pa was drunk and ike was only four years old so they never come up no more well for the next day or two we had considerable trouble because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take jim away from me saying they believed he was a runaway nigger we dont run daytimes no more now nights they dont bother us the duke says leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to ill think the thing overill invent a plan thatll fix it well let it alone for today because of course we dont want to go by that town yonder in daylightit mightnt be healthy towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain the heat lightning was squirting around low down in the sky and the leaves was beginning to shiverit was going to be pretty ugly it was easy to see that so the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam to see what the beds was like my bed was a straw tick better than jims which was a cornshuck tick theres always cobs around about in a shuck tick and they poke into you and hurt and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves it makes such a rustling that you wake up well the duke allowed he would take my bed but the king allowed he wouldnt he says i should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a cornshuck bed warnt just fitten for me to sleep on your grace ll take the shuck bed yourself jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them so we was pretty glad when the duke says tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit i yield i submit tis my fate i am alone in the worldlet me suffer can bear it we got away as soon as it was good and dark the king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town we come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and bythat was the town you knowand slid by about a half a mile out all right when we was threequarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern and about ten oclock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night it was my watch below till twelve but i wouldnt a turned in anyway if id had a bed because a body dont see such a storm as that every day in the week not by a long sight my souls how the wind did scream along and every second or two thered come a glare that lit up the whitecaps for a half a mile around and youd see the islands looking dusty through the rain and the trees thrashing around in the wind then comes a hwhackbum bum bumbleumbleumbumbumbumbumand the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away and quitand then rip comes another flash and another sockdolager the waves most washed me off the raft sometimes but i hadnt any clothes on and didnt mind we didnt have no trouble about snags the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them i had the middle watch you know but i was pretty sleepy by that time so jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me he was always mighty good that way jim was i crawled into the wigwam but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warnt no show for me so i laid outsidei didnt mind the rain because it was warm and the waves warnt running so high now about two they come up again though and jim was going to call me but he changed his mind because he reckoned they warnt high enough yet to do any harm but he was mistaken about that for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard it most killed jim alaughing he was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was anyway i took the watch and jim he laid down and snored away and by and by the storm let up for good and all and the first cabinlight that showed i rousted him out and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day the king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast and him and the duke played sevenup a while five cents a game then they got tired of it and allowed they would lay out a campaign as they called it the duke went down into his carpetbag and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud one bill said the celebrated dr armand de montalban of paris would lecture on the science of phrenology at such and such a place on the blank day of blank at ten cents admission and furnish charts of character at twentyfive cents apiece the duke said that was him in another bill he was the worldrenowned shakespearian tragedian garrick the younger of drury lane london in other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things like finding water and gold with a diviningrod dissipating witch spells and so on by and by he says but the histrionic muse is the darling have you ever trod the boards royalty no says the king you shall then before youre three days older fallen grandeur says the duke the first good town we come to well hire a hall and do the sword fight in richard iii and the balcony scene in romeo and juliet how does that strike you im in up to the hub for anything that will pay bilgewater but you see i dont know nothing about playactin and haint ever seen much of it i was too small when pap used to have em at the palace do you reckon you can learn me easy all right im jist afreezn for something fresh anyway les commence right away so the duke he told him all about who romeo was and who juliet was and said he was used to being romeo so the king could be juliet but if juliets such a young gal duke my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin to look oncommon odd on her maybe no dont you worry these country jakes wont ever think of that besides you know youll be in costume and that makes all the difference in the world juliets in a balcony enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed and shes got on her nightgown and her ruffled nightcap here are the costumes for the parts illustration the king as juliet he got out two or three curtaincalico suits which he said was meedyevil armor for richard iii and tother chap and a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match the king was satisfied so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid spreadeagle way prancing around and acting at the same time to show how it had got to be done then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart there was a little onehorse town about three mile down the bend and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for jim so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing the king allowed he would go too and see if he couldnt strike something we was out of coffee so jim said i better go along with them in the canoe and get some when we got there there warnt nobody stirring streets empty and perfectly dead and still like sunday we found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard and he said everybody that warnt too young or too sick or too old was gone to campmeeting about two mile back in the woods the king got the directions and allowed hed go and work that campmeeting for all it was worth and i might go too the duke said what he was after was a printingoffice we found it a little bit of a concern up over a carpenter shopcarpenters and printers all gone to the meeting and no doors locked it was a dirty litteredup place and had ink marks and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them all over the walls the duke shed his coat and said he was all right now so me and the king lit out for the campmeeting we got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping for it was a most awful hot day there was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around the woods was full of teams and wagons hitched everywheres feeding out of the wagontroughs and stomping to keep off the flies there was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell and piles of watermelons and green corn and suchlike truck the preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds only they was bigger and held crowds of people the benches was made out of outside slabs of logs with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs they didnt have no backs the preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds the women had on sunbonnets and some had linseywoolsey frocks some gingham ones and a few of the young ones had on calico some of the young men was barefooted and some of the children didnt have on any clothes but just a towlinen shirt some of the old women was knitting and some of the young folks was courting on the sly illustration courting on the sly the first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn he lined out two lines everybody sung it and it was kind of grand to hear it there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way then he lined out two more for them to singand so on the people woke up more and more and sung louder and louder and towards the end some begun to groan and some begun to shout then the preacher begun to preach and begun in earnest too and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other and then aleaning down over the front of it with his arms and his body going all the time and shouting his words out with all his might and every now and then he would hold up his bible and spread it open and kind of pass it around this way and that shouting its the brazen serpent in the wilderness look upon it and live and people would shout out gloryaamen and so he went on and the people groaning and crying and saying amen oh come to the mourners bench come black with sin amen come sick and sore amen come lame and halt and blind amen come pore and needy sunk in shame aamen come all thats worn and soiled and sufferingcome with a broken spirit come with a contrite heart come in your rags and sin and dirt the waters that cleanse is free the door of heaven stands openoh enter in and be at rest aamen glory glory hallelujah and so on you couldnt make out what the preacher said any more on account of the shouting and crying folks got up everywheres in the crowd and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners bench with the tears running down their faces and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw just crazy and wild well the first i knowed the king got agoing and you could hear him over everybody and next he went acharging up on to the platform and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people and he done it he told them he was a piratebeen a pirate for thirty years out in the indian oceanand his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight and he was home now to take out some fresh men and thanks to goodness hed been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent and he was glad of it it was the blessedest thing that ever happened to him because he was a changed man now and happy for the first time in his life and poor as he was he was going to start right off and work his way back to the indian ocean and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path for he could do it better than anybody else being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean and though it would take him a long time to get there without money he would get there anyway and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him dont you thank me dont you give me no credit it all belongs to them dear people in pokeville campmeeting natural brothers and benefactors of the race and that dear preacher there the truest friend a pirate ever had illustration a pirate for thirty years and then he busted into tears and so did everybody then somebody sings out take up a collection for him take up a collection well a half a dozen made a jump to do it but somebody sings out let him pass the hat around then everybody said it the preacher too so the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there and every little while the prettiest kind of girls with the tears running down their cheeks would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by and he always done it and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six timesand he was invited to stay a week and everybody wanted him to live in their houses and said theyd think it was an honor but he said as this was the last day of the campmeeting he couldnt do no good and besides he was in a sweat to get to the indian ocean right off and go to work on the pirates when we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eightyseven dollars and seventyfive cents and then he had fetched away a threegallon jug of whisky too that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods the king said take it all around it laid over any day hed ever put in in the missionarying line he said it warnt no use talking heathens dont amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a campmeeting with the duke was thinking hed been doing pretty well till the king come to show up but after that he didnt think so so much he had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printingofficehorse billsand took the money four dollars and he had got in ten dollars worth of advertisements for the paper which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advanceso they done it the price of the paper was two dollars a year but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it and was going to run it for cash he set up a little piece of poetry which he made himself out of his own headthree verseskind of sweet and saddishthe name of it was yes crush cold world this breaking heartand he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper and didnt charge nothing for it well he took in nine dollars and a half and said hed done a pretty square days work for it then he showed us another little job hed printed and hadnt charged for because it was for us it had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder and 200 reward under it the reading was all about jim and just described him to a dot it said he run away from st jacques plantation forty mile below new orleans last winter and likely went north and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses illustration another little job now says the duke after tonight we can run in the daytime if we want to whenever we see anybody coming we can tie jim hand and foot with a rope and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river and were too poor to travel on a steamboat so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward handcuffs and chains would look still better on jim but it wouldnt go well with the story of us being so poor too much like jewelry ropes are the correct thingwe must preserve the unities as we say on the boards we all said the duke was pretty smart and there couldnt be no trouble about running daytimes we judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the dukes work in the printing office was going to make in that little town then we could boom right along if we wanted to we laid low and kept still and never shoved out till nearly ten oclock then we slid by pretty wide away from the town and didnt hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it when jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning he says huck does you reckn we gwyne to run acrost any mo kings on dis trip no i says i reckon not well says he dats all right den i doan mine one er two kings but dats enough dis ones powerful drunk en de duke ain much better i found jim had been trying to get him to talk french so he could hear what it was like but he said he had been in this country so long and had so much trouble hed forgot it illustration practicing chapter xxi it was after sunup now but we went right on and didnt tie up the king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty but after theyd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal after breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches and let his legs dangle in the water so as to be comfortable and lit his pipe and went to getting his romeo and juliet by heart when he had got it pretty good him and the duke begun to practice it together the duke had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech and he made him sigh and put his hand on his heart and after a while he said he done it pretty well only he says you mustnt bellow out romeo that way like a bullyou must say it soft and sick and languishy soroomeo that is the idea for juliets a dear sweet mere child of a girl you know and she doesnt bray like a jackass well next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak laths and begun to practice the sword fightthe duke called himself richard iii and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see but by and by the king tripped and fell overboard and after that they took a rest and had a talk about all kinds of adventures theyd had in other times along the river after dinner the duke says well capet well want to make this a firstclass show you know so i guess well add a little more to it we want a little something to answer encores with anyway whats onkores bilgewater the duke told him and then says ill answer by doing the highland fling or the sailors hornpipe and youwell let me seeoh ive got ityou can do hamlets soliloquy hamlets which hamlets soliloquy you know the most celebrated thing in shakespeare ah its sublime sublime always fetches the house i havent got it in the bookive only got one volumebut i reckon i can piece it out from memory ill just walk up and down a minute and see if i can call it back from recollections vaults illustration hamlets soliloquy so he went to marching up and down thinking and frowning horrible every now and then then he would hoist up his eyebrows next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan next he would sigh and next hed let on to drop a tear it was beautiful to see him by and by he got it he told us to give attention then he strikes a most noble attitude with one leg shoved forwards and his arms stretched away up and his head tilted back looking up at the sky and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth and after that all through his speech he howled and spread around and swelled up his chest and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever i see before this is the speechi learned it easy enough while he was learning it to the king to be or not to be that is the bare bodkin that makes calamity of so long life for who would fardels bear till birnam wood do come to dunsinane but that the fear of something after death murders the innocent sleep great natures second course and makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune than fly to others that we know not of theres the respect must give us pause wake duncan with thy knocking i would thou couldst for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely the laws delay and the quietus which his pangs might take in the dead waste and middle of the night when churchyards yawn in customary suits of solemn black but that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns breathes forth contagion on the world and thus the native hue of resolution like the poor cat i the adage is sicklied oer with care and all the clouds that lowered oer our housetops with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action tis a consummation devoutly to be wished but soft you the fair ophelia ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws but get thee to a nunnerygo well the old man he liked that speech and he mighty soon got it so he could do it firstrate it seemed like he was just born for it and when he had his hand in and was excited it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off the first chance we got the duke he had some showbills printed and after that for two or three days as we floated along the raft was a most uncommon lively place for there warnt nothing but sword fighting and rehearsingas the duke called itgoing on all the time one morning when we was pretty well down the state of arkansaw we come in sight of a little onehorse town in a big bend so we tied up about threequarters of a mile above it in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees and all of us but jim took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show we struck it mighty lucky there was going to be a circus there that afternoon and the country people was already beginning to come in in all kinds of old shackly wagons and on horses the circus would leave before night so our show would have a pretty good chance the duke he hired the courthouse and we went around and stuck up our bills they read like this shaksperean revival wonderful attraction for one night only the world renowned tragedians david garrick the younger of drury lane theatre london and edmund kean the elder of the royal haymarket theatre whitechapel pudding lane piccadilly london and

soliloquy by the illustrious kean done by him 300 consecutive nights in paris for one night only on account of imperative european engagements admission 25 cents children and servants 10 cents then we went loafing around town the stores and houses was most all old shackly dried up frame concerns that hadnt ever been painted they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed the houses had little gardens around them but they didnt seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpsonweeds and sunflowers and ash piles and old curledup boots and shoes and pieces of bottles and rags and playedout tinware the fences was made of different kinds of boards nailed on at different times and they leaned every which way and had gates that didnt generly have but one hingea leather one some of the fences had been whitewashed some time or another but the duke said it was in clumbus time like enough there was generly hogs in the garden and people driving them out all the stores was along one street they had white domestic awnings in front and the country people hitched their horses to the awningposts there was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings and loafers roosting on them all day long whittling them with their barlow knives and chawing tobacco and gaping and yawning and stretchinga mighty ornery lot they generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella but didnt wear no coats nor waistcoats they called one another bill and buck and hank and joe and andy and talked lazy and drawly and used considerable many cuss words there was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awningpost and he most always had his hands in his britchespockets except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch what a body was hearing amongst them all the time was gimme a chaw v tobacker hank caint i haint got but one chaw left ask bill illustration gimme a chaw maybe bill he gives him a chaw maybe he lies and says he aint got none some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world nor a chaw of tobacco of their own they get all their chawing by borrowing they say to a fellow i wisht youd len me a chaw jack i jist this minute give ben thompson the last chaw i hadwhich is a lie pretty much everytime it dont fool nobody but a stranger but jack aint no stranger so he says you give him a chaw did you so did your sisters cats grandmother you pay me back the chaws youve awready borryd offn me lafe buckner then ill loan you one or two ton of it and wont charge you no back intrust nuther well i did pay you back some of it wunst yes you didbout six chaws you borryd store tobacker and paid back niggerhead store tobacco is flat black plug but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted when they borrow a chaw they dont generly cut it off with a knife but set the plug in between their teeth and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when its handed back and says sarcastic here gimme the chaw and you take the plug all the streets and lanes was just mud they warnt nothing else but mudmud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places and two or three inches deep in all the places the hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres youd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way where folks had to walk around her and shed stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her and look as happy as if she was on salary and pretty soon youd hear a loafer sing out hi so boy sick him tige and away the sow would go squealing most horrible with a dog or two swinging to each ear and three or four dozen more acoming and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise then theyd settle back again till there was a dog fight there couldnt anything wake them up all over and make them happy all over like a dog fightunless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death on the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank and they was bowed and bent and about ready to tumble in the people had moved out of them the bank was caved away under one corner of some others and that corner was hanging over people lived in them yet but it was dangersome because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer such a town as that has to be always moving back and back and back because the rivers always gnawing at it the nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets and more coming all the time families fetched their dinners with them from the country and eat them in the wagons there was considerable whisky drinking going on and i seen three fights by and by somebody sings out here comes old boggsin from the country for his little old monthly drunk here he comes boys all the loafers looked glad i reckoned they was used to having fun out of boggs one of them says wonder who hes agwyne to chaw up this time if hed achawed up all the men hes ben agwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year hed have considerable ruputation now another one says i wisht old boggs d threaten me cuz then id know i warnt gwyne to die for a thousan year boggs comes atearing along on his horse whooping and yelling like an injun and singing out cler the track thar im on the wawpath and the price uv coffins is agwyne to raise illustration a little monthly drunk he was drunk and weaving about in his saddle he was over fifty year old and had a very red face everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him and he sassed back and said hed attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns but he couldnt wait now because hed come to town to kill old colonel sherburn and his motto was meat first and spoon vittles to top off on he see me and rode up and says whard you come fm boy you prepared to die then he rode on i was scared but a man says he dont mean nothing hes always acarryin on like that when hes drunk hes the best naturedest old fool in arkansawnever hurt nobody drunk nor sober boggs rode up before the biggest store in town and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells come out here sherburn come out and meet the man youve swindled youre the houn im after and im agwyne to have you too and so he went on calling sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on by and by a proudlooking man about fiftyfiveand he was a heap the best dressed man in that town toosteps out of the store and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come he says to boggs mighty cam and slowhe says im tired of this but ill endure it till one oclock till one oclock mindno longer if you open your mouth against me only once after that time you cant travel so far but i will find you then he turns and goes in the crowd looked mighty sober nobody stirred and there warnt no more laughing boggs rode off blackguarding sherburn as loud as he could yell all down the street and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store still keeping it up some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up but he wouldnt they told him it would be one oclock in about fifteen minutes and so he must go homehe must go right away but it didnt do no good he cussed away with all his might and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it and pretty soon away he went araging down the street again with his gray hair aflying everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober but it warnt no useup the street he would tear again and give sherburn another cussing by and by somebody says go for his daughterquick go for his daughter sometimes hell listen to her if anybody can persuade him she can so somebody started on a run i walked down street a ways and stopped in about five or ten minutes here comes boggs again but not on his horse he was areeling across the street towards me bareheaded with a friend on both sides of him aholt of his arms and hurrying him along he was quiet and looked uneasy and he warnt hanging back any but was doing some of the hurrying himself somebody sings out boggs i looked over there to see who said it and it was that colonel sherburn he was standing perfectly still in the street and had a pistol raised in his right handnot aiming it but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky the same second i see a young girl coming on the run and two men with her boggs and the men turned round to see who called him and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side and the pistolbarrel come down slow and steady to a levelboth barrels cocked boggs throws up both of his hands and says o lord dont shoot bang goes the first shot and he staggers back clawing at the airbang goes the second one and he tumbles backwards on to the ground heavy and solid with his arms spread out that young girl screamed out and comes rushing and down she throws herself on her father crying and saying oh hes killed him hes killed him the crowd closed up around them and shouldered and jammed one another with their necks stretched trying to see and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting back back give him air give him air illustration the death of boggs colonel sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground and turned around on his heels and walked off they took boggs to a little drug store the crowd pressing around just the same and the whole town following and i rushed and got a good place at the window where i was close to him and could see in they laid him on the floor and put one large bible under his head and opened another one and spread it on his breast but they tore open his shirt first and i seen where one of the bullets went in he made about a dozen long gasps his breast lifting the bible up when he drawed in his breath and letting it down again when he breathed it outand after that he laid still he was dead then they pulled his daughter away from him screaming and crying and took her off she was about sixteen and very sweet and gentle looking but awful pale and scared well pretty soon the whole town was there squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look but people that had the places wouldnt give them up and folks behind them was saying all the time say now youve looked enough you fellows taint right and taint fair for you to stay thar all the time and never give nobody a chance other folks has their rights as well as you there was considerable jawing back so i slid out thinking maybe there was going to be trouble the streets was full and everybody was excited everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows stretching their necks and listening one long lanky man with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head and a crookedhandled cane marked out the places on the ground where boggs stood and where sherburn stood and the people following him around from one place to tother and watching everything he done and bobbing their heads to show they understood and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane and then he stood up straight and stiff where sherburn had stood frowning and having his hatbrim down over his eyes and sung out boggs and then fetched his cane down slow to a level and says bang staggered backwards says bang again and fell down flat on his back the people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect said it was just exactly the way it all happened then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him well by and by somebody said sherburn ought to be lynched in about a minute everybody was saying it so away they went mad and yelling and snatching down every clothesline they come to to do the hanging with illustration sherburn steps out chapter xxii they swarmed up towards sherburns house awhooping and raging like injuns and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush and it was awful to see children was heeling it ahead of the mob screaming and trying to get out of the way and every window along the road was full of womens heads and there was nigger boys in every tree and bucks and wenches looking over every fence and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on scared most to death they swarmed up in front of sherburns palings as thick as they could jam together and you couldnt hear yourself think for the noise it was a little twentyfoot yard some sung out tear down the fence tear down the fence then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing and down she goes and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave just then sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch with a doublebarrel gun in his hand and takes his stand perfectly cam and deliberate not saying a word the racket stopped and the wave sucked back sherburn never said a wordjust stood there looking down the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to outgaze him but they couldnt they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky then pretty soon sherburn sort of laughed not the pleasant kind but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread thats got sand in it then he says slow and scornful the idea of you lynching anybody its amusing the idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man because youre brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless castout women that come along here did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man why a mans safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kindas long as its daytime and youre not behind him do i know you i know you clear through was born and raised in the south and ive lived in the north so i know the average all around the average mans a coward in the north he lets anybody walk over him that wants to and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it in the south one man all by himself has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime and robbed the lot your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other peoplewhereas youre just as brave and no braver why dont your juries hang murderers because theyre afraid the mans friends will shoot them in the back in the darkand its just what they would do so they always acquit and then a man goes in the night with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal your mistake is that you didnt bring a man with you thats one mistake and the other is that you didnt come in the dark and fetch your masks you brought part of a manbuck harkness thereand if you hadnt had him to start you youd a taken it out in blowing you didnt want to come the average man dont like trouble and danger you dont like trouble and danger but if only half a manlike buck harkness thereshouts lynch him lynch him youre afraid to back downafraid youll be found out to be what you arecowardsand so you raise a yell and hang yourselves on to that halfamans coattail and come raging up here swearing what big things youre going to do the pitifulest thing out is a mob thats what an army isa mob they dont fight with courage thats born in them but with courage thats borrowed from their mass and from their officers but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole if any real lynchings going to be done it will be done in the dark southern fashion and when they come theyll bring their masks and fetch a man along now leaveand take your halfaman with youtossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck harkness he heeled it after them looking tolerable cheap i could a stayed if i wanted to but i didnt want to i went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by and then dived in under the tent i had my twentydollar gold piece and some other money but i reckoned i better save it because there aint no telling how soon you are going to need it away from home and amongst strangers that way you cant be too careful i aint opposed to spending money on circuses when there aint no other way but there aint no use in wasting it on them illustration a dead head it was a real bully circus it was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in two and two a gentleman and lady side by side the men just in their drawers and undershirts and no shoes nor stirrups and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortablethere must a been twenty of themand every lady with a lovely complexion and perfectly beautiful and looking just like a gang of real sureenough queens and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars and just littered with diamonds it was a powerful fine sight i never see anything so lovely and then one by one they got up and stood and went aweaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight with their heads bobbing and skimming along away up there under the tentroof and every ladys roseleafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips and she looking like the most loveliest parasol and then faster and faster they went all of them dancing first one foot out in the air and then the other the horses leaning more and more and the ringmaster going round and round the centerpole cracking his whip and shouting hihi and the clown cracking jokes behind him and by and by all hands dropped the reins and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves and so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring and made the sweetest bow i ever see and then scampered out and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild well all through the circus they done the most astonishing things and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people the ringmaster couldnt ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said and how he ever could think of so many of them and so sudden and so pat was what i couldnt noway understand why i couldnt a thought of them in a year and by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ringsaid he wanted to ride said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was they argued and tried to keep him out but he wouldnt listen and the whole show come to a standstill then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him and that made him mad and he begun to rip and tear so that stirred up the people and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring saying knock him down throw him out and one or two women begun to scream so then the ringmaster he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldnt be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldnt make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse so everybody laughed and said all right and the man got on the minute he was on the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him and the drunk man hanging on to his neck and his heels flying in the air every jump and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down and at last sure enough all the circus men could do the horse broke loose and away he went like the very nation round and round the ring with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side and then tother one on tother side and the people just crazy it warnt funny to me though i was all of a tremble to see his danger but pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle areeling this way and that and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood and the horse agoing like a house afire too he just stood up there asailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warnt ever drunk in his lifeand then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them he shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits and then there he was slim and handsome and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly humand finally skipped off and made his bow and danced off to the dressingroom and everybody just ahowling with pleasure and astonishment illustration he shed seventeen suits then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled and he was the sickest ringmaster you ever see i reckon why it was one of his own men he had got up that joke all out of his own head and never let on to nobody well i felt sheepish enough to be took in so but i wouldnt a been in that ringmasters place not for a thousand dollars i dont know there may be bullier circuses than what that one was but i never struck them yet anyways it was plenty good enough for me and wherever i run across it it can have all of my custom every time well that night we had our show but there warnt only about twelve people therejust enough to pay expenses and they laughed all the time and that made the duke mad and everybody left anyway before the show was over but one boy which was asleep so the duke said these arkansaw lunkheads couldnt come up to shakespeare what they wanted was low comedyand maybe something ruther worse than low comedy he reckoned he said he could size their style so next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint and drawed off some handbills and stuck them up all over the village the bills said at the court house for 3 nights only the worldrenowned tragedians david garrick the younger and edmund kean the elder of the london and continental theatres in their thrilling tragedy of the kings cameleopard or the royal nonesuch admission 50 cents then at the bottom was the biggest line of all which said ladies and children not admitted there says he if that line dont fetch them i dont know arkansaw illustration tragedy chapter xxiii well all day him and the king was hard at it rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights and that night the house was jam full of men in no time when the place couldnt hold no more the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech and praised up this tragedy and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was and so he went on abragging about the tragedy and about edmund kean the elder which was to play the main principal part in it and at last when hed got everybodys expectations up high enough he rolled up the curtain and the next minute the king come aprancing out on all fours naked and he was painted all over ringstreakedand striped all sorts of colors as splendid as a rainbow andbut never mind the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was awful funny the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and hawhawed till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him do it another time well it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut then the duke he lets the curtain down and bows to the people and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more on accounts of pressing london engagements where the seats is all sold already for it in drury lane and then he makes them another bow and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it twenty people sings out what is it over is that all the duke says yes then there was a fine time everybody sings out sold and rose up mad and was agoing for that stage and them tragedians but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts hold on just a word gentlemen they stopped to listen we are soldmighty badly sold but we dont want to be the laughing stock of this whole town i reckon and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live no what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this show up and sell the rest of the town then well all be in the same boat aint that sensible you bet it isthe jedge is right everybody sings out all right thennot a word about any sell go along home and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy next day you couldnt hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was house was jammed again that night and we sold this crowd the same way when me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper and by and by about midnight they made jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town the third night the house was crammed againand they warnt newcomers this time but people that was at the show the other two nights i stood by the duke at the door and i see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging or something muffled up under his coatand i see it warnt no perfumery neither not by a long sight i smelt sickly eggs by the barrel and rotten cabbages and such things and if i know the signs of a dead cat being around and i bet i do there was sixtyfour of them went in i shoved in there for a minute but it was too various for me i couldnt stand it well when the place couldnt hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute and then he started around for the stage door i after him but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says walk fast now till you get away from the houses and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you i done it and he done the same we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word i reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience but nothing of the sort pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam and says well howd the old thing pan out this time duke he hadnt been up town at all we never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village then we lit up and had a supper and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way theyd served them people the duke says greenhorns flatheads i knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in and i knew theyd lay for us the third night and consider it was their turn now well it is their turn and id give something to know how much theyd take for it i would just like to know how theyre putting in their opportunity they can turn it into a picnic if they want tothey brought plenty provisions them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixtyfive dollars in that three nights i never see money hauled in by the wagonload like that before by and by when they was asleep and snoring jim says illustration their pockets bulged dont it sprise you de way dem kings carries on huck no i says it dont why dont it huck well it dont because its in the breed i reckon theyre all alike but huck dese kings o ourn is reglar rapscallions dats jist what dey is deys reglar rapscallions well thats what im asaying all kings is mostly rapscallions as fur as i can make out is dat so you read about them onceyoull see look at henry the eight this n s a sundayschool superintendent to him and look at charles second and louis fourteen and louis fifteen and james second and edward second and richard third and forty more besides all them saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise cain my you ought to seen old henry the eight when he was in bloom he was a blossom he used to marry a new wife every day and chop off her head next morning and he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs fetch up nell gwynn he says they fetch her up next morning chop off her head and they chop it off fetch up jane shore he says and up she comes next morning chop off her headand they chop it off ring up fair rosamun fair rosamun answers the bell next morning chop off her head and he made every one of them tell him a tale every night and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way and then he put them all in a book and called it domesday bookwhich was a good name and stated the case you dont know kings jim but i know them and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest ive struck in history well henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country how does he go at itgive noticegive the country a show no all of a sudden he heaves all the tea in boston harbor overboard and whacks out a declaration of independence and dares them to come on that was his stylehe never give anybody a chance he had suspicions of his father the duke of wellington well what did he do ask him to show up nodrownded him in a butt of mamsey like a cat spose people left money laying around where he waswhat did he do he collared it spose he contracted to do a thing and you paid him and didnt set down there and see that he done itwhat did he do he always done the other thing spose he opened his mouthwhat then if he didnt shut it up powerful quick hed lose a lie every time thats the kind of a bug henry was and if wed a had him along stead of our kings hed a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done i dont say that ourn is lambs because they aint when you come right down to the cold facts but they aint nothing to that old ram anyway all i say is kings is kings and you got to make allowances take them all around theyre a mighty ornery lot its the way theyre raised illustration henry the eighth in boston harbour but dis one do smell so like de nation huck well they all do jim we cant help the way a king smells history dont tell no way now de duke hes a tolerble likely man in some ways yes a dukes different but not very different this ones a middling hard lot for a duke when hes drunk there aint no near sighted man could tell him from a king well anyways i doan hanker for no mo un um huck dese is all i kin stan its the way i feel too jim but weve got them on our hands and we got to remember what they are and make allowances sometimes i wish we could hear of a country thats out of kings what was the use to tell jim these warnt real kings and dukes it wouldnt a done no good and besides it was just as i said you couldnt tell them from the real kind i went to sleep and jim didnt call me when it was my turn he often done that when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees moaning and mourning to himself i didnt take notice nor let on i knowed what it was about he was thinking about his wife and his children away up yonder and he was low and homesick because he hadnt ever been away from home before in his life and i do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for theirn it dont seem natural but i reckon its so he was often moaning and mourning that way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying po little lizabeth po little johnny its mighty hard i spec i aint ever gwyne to see you no mo no mo he was a mighty good nigger jim was but this time i somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones and by and by he says what makes me feel so bad dis time uz

she was plumb deef en dumb huck plumb deef en dumben id ben atreatn her so illustration harmless chapter xxiv next day towards night we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle where there was a village on each side of the river and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns jim he spoke to the duke and said he hoped it wouldnt take but a few hours because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope you see when we left him all alone we had to tie him because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldnt look much like he was a runaway nigger you know so the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all day and hed cipher out some way to get around it he was uncommon bright the duke was and he soon struck it he dressed jim up in king lears outfitit was a long curtaincalico gown and a white horsehair wig and whiskers and then he took his theater paint and painted jims face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead dull solid blue like a man thats been drownded nine days blamed if he warnt the horriblest looking outrage i ever see then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so sick arabbut harmless when not out of his head and he nailed that shingle to a lath and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam jim was satisfied he said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day and trembling all over every time there was a sound the duke told him to make himself free and easy and if anybody ever come meddling around he must hop out of the wigwam and carry on a little and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldnt wait for him to howl why he didnt only look like he was dead he looked considerable more than that these rapscallions wanted to try the nonesuch again because there was so much money in it but they judged it wouldnt be safe because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time they couldnt hit no project that suited exactly so at last the duke said he reckoned hed lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldnt put up something on the arkansaw village and the king he allowed he would drop over to tother village without any plan but just trust in providence to lead him the profitable waymeaning the devil i reckon we had all bought store clothes where we stopped last and now the king put hisn on and he told me to put mine on i done it of course the kings duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy i never knowed how clothes could change a body before why before he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when hed take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and pious that youd say he had walked right out of the ark and maybe was old leviticus himself jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my paddle ready there was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point about three mile above the townbeen there a couple of hours taking on freight says the king seein how im dressed i reckon maybe i better arrive down from st louis or cincinnati or some other big place go for the steamboat huckleberry well come down to the village on her i didnt have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride i fetched the shore a half a mile above the village and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water pretty soon we come to a nice innocentlooking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face for it was powerful warm weather and he had a couple of big carpetbags by him run her nose in shore says the king i done it wher you bound for young man for the steamboat going to orleans git aboard says the king hold on a minute my servant ll hep you with them bags jump out and hep the gentleman adolphusmeaning me i see illustration adolphus i done so and then we all three started on again the young chap was mighty thankful said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather he asked the king where he was going and the king told him hed come down the river and landed at the other village this morning and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there the young fellow says when i first see you i says to myself its mr wilks sure and he come mighty near getting here in time but then i says again no i reckon it aint him or else he wouldnt be paddling up the river you aint him are you no my names blodgettelexander blodgettreverend elexander blodgett i spose i must say as im one o the lords poor servants but still im jist as able to be sorry for mr wilks for not arriving in time all the same if hes missed anything by itwhich i hope he hasnt well he dont miss any property by it because hell get that all right but hes missed seeing his brother peter diewhich he maynt mind nobody can tell as to thatbut his brother would a give anything in this world to see him before he died never talked about nothing else all these three weeks hadnt seen him since they was boys togetherand hadnt ever seen his brother william at allthats the deef and dumb onewilliam aint more than thirty or thirtyfive peter and george were the only ones that come out here george was the married brother him and his wife both died last year harvey and williams the only ones thats left now and as i was saying they havent got here in time did anybody send em word oh yes a month or two ago when peter was first took because peter said then that he sorter felt like he warnt going to get well this time you see he was pretty old and georges gyirls was too young to be much company for him except mary jane the redheaded one and so he was kinder lonesome after george and his wife died and didnt seem to care much to live he most desperately wanted to see harveyand william too for that matterbecause he was one of them kind that cant bear to make a will he left a letter behind for harvey and said hed told in it where his money was hid and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so georges gyirls would be all rightfor george didnt leave nothing and that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to why do you reckon harvey dont come wher does he live oh he lives in englandsheffieldpreaches therehasnt ever been in this country he hasnt had any too much timeand besides he mightnt a got the letter at all you know too bad too bad he couldnt a lived to see his brothers poor soul you going to orleans you say yes but that aint only a part of it im going in a ship next wednesday for ryo janeero where my uncle lives its a pretty long journey but itll be lovely wisht i was agoing is mary jane the oldest how old is the others mary janes nineteen susans fifteen and joannas about fourteenthats the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare lip poor things to be left alone in the cold world so well they could be worse off old peter had friends and they aint going to let them come to no harm theres hobson the babtis preacher and deacon lot hovey and ben rucker and abner shackleford and levi bell the lawyer and dr robinson and their wives and the widow bartley andwell theres a lot of them but these are the ones that peter was thickest with and used to write about sometimes when he wrote home so harvey ll know where to look for friends when he gets here illustration he fairly emptied that young fellow well the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow blamed if he didnt inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilkses and about peters businesswhich was a tanner and about georgeswhich was a carpenter and about harveyswhich was a dissentering minister and so on and so on then he says what did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for because shes a big orleans boat and i was afeard she mightnt stop there when theyre deep they wont stop for a hail a cincinnati boat will but this is a st louis one was peter wilks well off oh yes pretty well off he had houses and land and its reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up somers when did you say he died i didnt say but it was last night funeral tomorrow likely yes bout the middle of the day well its all terrible sad but weve all got to go one time or another so what we want to do is to be prepared then were all right yes sir its the best way ma used to always say that when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got off the king never said nothing about going aboard so i lost my ride after all when the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place and then he got ashore and says now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpetbags and if hes gone over to tother side go over there and git him and tell him to git himself up regardless shove along now i see what he was up to but i never said nothing of course when i got back with the duke we hid the canoe and then they set down on a log and the king told him everything just like the young fellow had said itevery last word of it and all the time he was adoing it he tried to talk like an englishman and he done it pretty well too for a slouch i cant imitate him and so i aint agoing to try to but he really done it pretty good then he says how are you on the deef and dumb bilgewater the duke said leave him alone for that said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards so then they waited for a steamboat about the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along but they didnt come from high enough up the river but at last there was a big one and they hailed her she sent out her yawl and we went aboard and she was from cincinnati and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad and gave us a cussing and said they wouldnt land us but the king was cam he says if gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl a steamboat kin afford to carry em cant it so they softened down and said it was all right and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore about two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl acoming and when the king says kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher mr peter wilks lives they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say what d i tell you then one of them says kind of soft and gentle im sorry sir but the best we can do is to tell you where he did live yesterday evening sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash and fell up against the man and put his chin on his shoulder and cried down his back and says alas alas our poor brothergone and we never got to see him oh its too too hard illustration alas our poor brothers then he turns around blubbering and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands and blamed if he didnt drop a carpetbag and bust out acrying if they warnt the beatenest lot them two frauds that ever i struck well the men gathered around and sympathized with them and said all sorts of kind things to them and carried their carpetbags up the hill for them and let them lean on them and cry and told the king all about his brothers last moments and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke and both of them took on about that dead tanner like theyd lost the twelve disciples well if ever i struck anything like it im a nigger it was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race illustration you bet it is chapter xxv the news was all over town in two minutes and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way some of them putting on their coats as they come pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march the windows and dooryards was full and every minute somebody would say over a fence is it them and somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say you bet it is when we got to the house the street in front of it was packed and the three girls was standing in the door mary jane was redheaded but that dont make no difference she was most awful beautiful and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory she was so glad her uncles was come the king he spread his arms and mary jane she jumped for them and the harelip jumped for the duke and there they had it everybody most leastways women cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good times then the king he hunched the duke privatei see him do itand then he looked around and see the coffin over in the corner on two chairs so then him and the duke with a hand across each others shoulder and tother hand to their eyes walked slow and solemn over there everybody dropping back to give them room and all the talk and noise stopping people saying sh and all the men taking their hats off and drooping their heads so you could a heard a pin fall and when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin and took one sight and then they bust out acrying so you could a heard them to orleans most and then they put their arms around each others necks and hung their chins over each others shoulders and then for three minutes or maybe four i never see two men leak the way they done and mind you everybody was doing the same and the place was that damp i never see anything like it then one of them got on one side of the coffin and tother on tother side and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin and let on to pray all to themselves well when it come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loudthe poor girls too and every woman nearly went up to the girls without saying a word and kissed them solemn on the forehead and then put their hand on their head and looked up towards the sky with the tears running down and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing and give the next woman a show i never see anything so disgusting illustration leaking well by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little and works himself up and slobbers out a speech all full of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the diseased and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile but its a trial thats sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brothers heart because out of their mouths they cant words being too weak and cold and all that kind of rot and slush till it was just sickening and then he blubbers out a pious goodygoody amen and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust and the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer and everybody joined in with all their might and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out music is a good thing and after all that soulbutter and hogwash i never see it freshen up things so and sound so honest and bully then the king begins to work his jaw again and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening and help set up with the ashes of the diseased and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name for they was names that was very dear to him and mentioned often in his letters and so he will name the same to wit as follows vizzrev mr hobson and deacon lot hovey and mr ben rucker and abner shackleford and levi bell and dr robinson and their wives and the widow bartley rev hobson and dr robinson was down to the end of the town ahunting togetherthat is i mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to tother world and the preacher was pinting him right lawyer bell was away up to louisville on business but the rest was on hand and so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him and then they shook hands with the duke and didnt say nothing but just kept asmiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said googoogoogoogoo all the time like a baby that cant talk so the king he blattered along and managed to inquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town by his name and mentioned all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in the town or to georges family or to peter and he always let on that peter wrote him the things but that was a lie he got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat then mary jane she fetched the letter her father left behind and the king he read it out loud and cried over it it give the dwellinghouse and three thousand dollars gold to the girls and it give the tanyard which was doing a good business along with some other houses and land worth about seven thousand and three thousand dollars in gold to harvey and william and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar so these two frauds said theyd go and fetch it up and have everything square and aboveboard and told me to come with a candle we shut the cellar door behind us and when they found the bag they spilt it out on the floor and it was a lovely sight all them yaller boys my the way the kings eyes did shine he slaps the duke on the shoulder and says oh this aint bully nor nothn oh no i reckon not why biljy it beats the nonesuch dont it the duke allowed it did they pawed the yallerboys and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor and the king says it aint no use talkin bein brothers to a rich dead man and representatives of furrin heirs thats got left is the line for you and me bilge thish yer comes of trustn to providence its the best way in the long run ive tried em all and ther aint no better way most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile and took it on trust but no they must count it so they counts it and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short says the king dern him i wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen dollars they worried over that awhile and ransacked all around for it then the duke says well he was a pretty sick man and likely he made a mistakei reckon thats the way of it the best ways to let it go and keep still about it we can spare it oh shucks yes we can spare it i dont kyer nothn bout thatits the count im thinkin about we want to be awful square and open and aboveboard here you know we want to lug this hyer money up stairs and count it before everybodythen ther aint nothn suspicious but when the dead man says thers six thousn dollars you know we dont want to hold on says the duke les make up the deffisit and he begun to haul out yallerboys out of his pocket illustration making up the deffisit its a most amazn good idea dukeyou have got a rattlin clever head on you says the king blest if the old nonesuch aint a heppin us out agin and he begun to haul out yallerjackets and stack them up it most busted them but they made up the six thousand clean and clear say says the duke i got another idea les go up stairs and count this money and then take and give it to the girls good land duke lemme hug you its the most dazzling idea at ever a man struck you have certnly got the most astonishin head i ever see oh this is the boss dodge ther aint no mistake bout it let em fetch along their suspicions now if they want tothis ll lay em out when we got upstairs everybody gethered around the table and the king he counted it and stacked it up three hundred dollars in a piletwenty elegant little piles everybody looked hungry at it and licked their chops then they raked it into the bag again and i see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech he says friends all my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them thats left behind in the vale of sorrers he has done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered and thats left fatherless and motherless yes and we that knowed him knows that he would a done more generous by em if he hadnt ben afeard o woundin his dear william and me now wouldnt he ther aint no question bout it in my mind well then what kind o brothers would it be that d stand in his way at sech a time and what kind o uncles would it be that d robyes robsech poor sweet lambs as these at he loved so at sech a time if i know williamand i think i dohewell ill jest ask him he turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his hands and the duke he looks at him stupid and leatherheaded a while then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning and jumps for the king googooing with all his might for joy and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up then the king says i knowed it i reckon that ll convince anybody the way he feels about it here mary jane susan joanner take the moneytake it all its the gift of him that lays yonder cold but joyful illustration going for him mary jane she went for him susan and the harelip went for the duke and then such another hugging and kissing i never see yet and everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes and most shook the hands off of them frauds saying all the time you dear good soulshow lovelyhow could you well then pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again and how good he was and what a loss he was and all that and before long a big ironjawed man worked himself in there from outside and stood alistening and looking and not saying anything and nobody saying anything to him either because the king was talking and they was all busy listening the king was sayingin the middle of something hed started in on they bein partickler friends o the diseased thats why theyre invited here this evenin but tomorrow we want all to comeeverybody for he respected everybody he liked everybody and so its fitten that his funeral orgies shd be public and so he went amooning on and on liking to hear himself talk and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again till the duke he couldnt stand it no more so he writes on a little scrap of paper obsequies you old fool and folds it up and goes to googooing and reaching it over peoples heads to him the king he reads it and puts it in his pocket and says poor william afflicted as he is his hearts aluz right asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeralwants me to make em all welcome but he neednt a worriedit was jest what i was at then he weaves along again perfectly cam and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then just like he done before and when he done it the third time he says i say orgies not because its the common term because it aintobsequies bein the common termbut because orgies is the right term obsequies aint used in england no more nowits gone out we say orgies now in england orgies is better because it means the thing youre after more exact its a word thats made up outn the greek orgo outside open abroad and the hebrew jeesum to plant cover up hence inter so you see funeral orgies is an open er public funeral he was the worst i ever struck well the ironjawed man he laughed right in his face everybody was shocked everybody says why doctor and abner shackleford says why robinson haint you heard the news this is harvey wilks the king he smiled eager and shoved out his flapper and says is it my poor brothers dear good friend and physician i keep your hands off of me says the doctor you talk like an englishman dont you its the worst imitation i ever heard you peter wilkss brother youre a fraud thats what you are illustration the doctor well how they all took on they crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down and tried to explain to him and tell him how harvey d showed in forty ways that he was harvey and knowed everybody by name and the names of the very dogs and begged and begged him not to hurt harveys feelings and the poor girls feelings and all that but it warnt no use he stormed right along and said any man that pretended to be an englishman and couldnt imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar the poor girls was hanging to the king and crying and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on them he says i was your fathers friend and im your friend and i warn you as a friend and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him the ignorant tramp with his idiotic greek and hebrew as he calls it he is the thinnest kind of an impostorhas come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres and you take them for proofs and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here who ought to know better mary jane wilks you know me for your friend and for your unselfish friend too now listen to me turn this pitiful rascal outi beg you to do it will you mary jane straightened herself up and my but she was handsome she says here is my answer she hove up the bag of money and put it in the kings hands and says take this six thousand dollars and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to and dont give us no receipt for it then she put her arm around the king on one side and susan and the harelip done the same on the other everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud the doctor says all right i wash my hands of the matter but i warn you all that a time s coming when youre going to feel sick whenever you think of this day and away he went all right doctor says the king kinder mocking him well try and get em to send for you which made them all laugh and they said it was a prime good hit illustration the bag of money illustration the cubby chapter xxvi well when they was all gone the king he asks mary jane how they was off for spare rooms and she said she had one spare room which would do for uncle william and shed give her own room to uncle harvey which was a little bigger and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot and up garret was a little cubby with a pallet in it the king said the cubby would do for his valleymeaning me so mary jane took us up and she showed them their rooms which was plain but nice she said shed have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her room if they was in uncle harveys way but he said they warnt the frocks was hung along the wall and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor there was an old hair trunk in one corner and a guitarbox in another and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around like girls brisken up a room with the king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings and so dont disturb them the dukes room was pretty small but plenty good enough and so was my cubby that night they had a big supper and all them men and women was there and i stood behind the king and the dukes chairs and waited on them and the niggers waited on the rest mary jane she set at the head of the table with susan alongside of her and said how bad the biscuits was and how mean the preserves was and how ornery and tough the fried chickens wasand all that kind of rot the way women always do for to force out compliments and the people all knowed everything was tiptop and said sosaid how do you get biscuits to brown so nice and where for the lands sake did you get these amazn pickles and all that kind of humbug talkytalk just the way people always does at a supper you know illustration supper with the harelip and when it was all done me and the harelip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things the harelip she got to pumping me about england and blest if i didnt think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes she says did you ever see the king who william fourth well i bet i havehe goes to our church i knowed he

water away off there at the sea they havent got no conveniences for it oh i see now you might a said that in the first place and saved time when she said that i see i was out of the woods again and so i was comfortable and glad next she says do you go to church too yesregular where do you set why in our pew whose pew why ournyour uncle harveys hisn what does he want with a pew wants it to set in what did you reckon he wanted with it why i thought hed be in the pulpit rot him i forgot he was a preacher i see i was up a stump again so i played another chicken bone and got another think then i says blame it do you suppose there aint but one preacher to a church why what do they want with more whatto preach before a king i never did see such a girl as you they dont have no less than seventeen seventeen my land why i wouldnt set out such a string as that not if i never got to glory it must take em a week shucks they dont all of em preach the same dayonly one of em well then what does the rest of em do oh nothing much loll around pass the plateand one thing or another but mainly they dont do nothing well then what are they for why theyre for style dont you know nothing well i dont want to know no such foolishness as that how is servants treated in england do they treat em better n we treat our niggers no a servant aint nobody there they treat them worse than dogs dont they give em holidays the way we do christmas and new years week and fourth of july oh just listen a body could tell you haint ever been to england by that why harelwhy joanna they never see a holiday from years end to years end never go to the circus nor theater nor nigger shows nor nowheres nor church nor church but you always went to church well i was gone up again i forgot i was the old mans servant but next minute i whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and had to go to church whether he wanted to or not and set with the family on account of its being the law but i didnt do it pretty good and when i got done i see she warnt satisfied she says honest injun now haint you been telling me a lot of lies illustration honest injun honest injun says i none of it at all none of it at all not a lie in it says i lay your hand on this book and say it i see it warnt nothing but a dictionary so i laid my hand on it and said it so then she looked a little better satisfied and says well then ill believe some of it but i hope to gracious if ill believe the rest what is it you wont believe joe says mary jane stepping in with susan behind her it aint right nor kind for you to talk so to him and him a stranger and so far from his people how would you like to be treated so thats always your way maimalways sailing in to help somebody before theyre hurt i haint done nothing to him hes told some stretchers i reckon and i said i wouldnt swallow it all and thats every bit and grain i did say i reckon he can stand a little thing like that cant he i dont care whether twas little or whether twas big hes here in our house and a stranger and it wasnt good of you to say it if you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed and so you oughtnt to say a thing to another person that will make them feel ashamed why maim he said it dont make no difference what he saidthat aint the thing the thing is for you to treat him kind and not be saying things to make him remember he aint in his own country and amongst his own folks i says to myself this is a girl that im letting that old reptle rob her of her money then susan she waltzed in and if youll believe me she did give hare lip hark from the tomb says i to myself and this is another one that im letting him rob her of her money then mary jane she took another inning and went in sweet and lovely againwhich was her way but when she got done there warnt hardly anything left o poor harelip so she hollered all right then says the other girls you just ask his pardon she done it too and she done it beautiful she done it so beautiful it was good to hear and i wished i could tell her a thousand lies so she could do it again i says to myself this is another one that im letting him rob her of her money and when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know i was amongst friends i felt so ornery and low down and mean that i says to myself my minds made up ill hive that money for them or bust so then i lit outfor bed i said meaning some time or another when i got by myself i went to thinking the thing over i says to myself shall i go to that doctor private and blow on these frauds nothat wont do he might tell who told him then the king and the duke would make it warm for me shall i go private and tell mary jane noi dasnt do it her face would give them a hint sure theyve got the money and theyd slide right out and get away with it if she was to fetch in help id get mixed up in the business before it was done with i judge no there aint no good way but one i got to steal that money somehow and i got to steal it some way that they wont suspicion that i done it theyve got a good thing here and they aint agoing to leave till theyve played this family and this town for all theyre worth so ill find a chance time enough ill steal it and hide it and by and by when im away down the river ill write a letter and tell mary jane where its hid but i better hive it tonight if i can because the doctor maybe hasnt let up as much as he lets on he has he might scare them out of here yet so thinks i ill go and search them rooms upstairs the hall was dark but i found the dukes room and started to paw around it with my hands but i recollected it wouldnt be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self so then i went to his room and begun to paw around there but i see i couldnt do nothing without a candle and i dasnt light one of course so i judged id got to do the other thinglay for them and eavesdrop about that time i hears their footsteps coming and was going to skip under the bed i reached for it but it wasnt where i thought it would be but i touched the curtain that hid mary janes frocks so i jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns and stood there perfectly still illustration the duke looks under the bed they come in and shut the door and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed then i was glad i hadnt found the bed when i wanted it and yet you know its kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private they sets down then and the king says well what is it and cut it middlin short because its better for us to be down there awhoopin up the mournin than up here givin em a chance to talk us over well this is it capet i aint easy i aint comfortable that doctor lays on my mind i wanted to know your plans ive got a notion and i think its a sound one what is it duke that we better glide out of this before three in the morning and clip it down the river with what weve got specially seeing we got it so easygiven back to us flung at our heads as you may say when of course we allowed to have to steal it back im for knocking off and lighting out that made me feel pretty bad about an hour or two ago it would a been a little different but now it made me feel bad and disappointed the king rips out and says what and not sell out the rest o the property march off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thousn dollars worth o property layin around jest sufferin to be scooped inand all good salable stuff too the duke he grumbled said the bag of gold was enough and he didnt want to go no deeperdidnt want to rob a lot of orphans of everything they had why how you talk says the king we shant rob em of nothing at all but jest this money the people that buys the property is the suffrers because as soon s its found out at we didnt own itwhich wont be long after weve slidthe sale wont be valid and it ll all go back to the estate these yer orphans ll git their house back agin and thats enough for them theyre young and spry and kn easy earn a livin they aint agoin to suffer why jest thinktheres thousns and thousns that aint nigh so well off bless you they aint got nothn to complain of well the king he talked him blind so at last he give in and said all right but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay and that doctor hanging over them but the king says cuss the doctor what do we kyer for him haint we got all the fools in town on our side and aint that a big enough majority in any town so they got ready to go down stairs again the duke says i dont think we put that money in a good place that cheered me up id begun to think i warnt going to get a hint of no kind to help me the king says why because mary jane ll be in mourning from this out and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put em away and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it your heads level agin duke says the king and he comes afumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where i was i stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still though quivery and i wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me and i tried to think what id better do if they did catch me but the king he got the bag before i could think more than about a half a thought and he never suspicioned i was around they took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the featherbed and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now because a nigger only makes up the featherbed and dont turn over the straw tick only about twice a year and so it warnt in no danger of getting stole now illustration huck takes the money but i knowed better i had it out of there before they was halfway down stairs i groped along up to my cubby and hid it there till i could get a chance to do better i judged i better hide it outside of the house somewheres because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking i knowed that very well then i turned in with my clothes all on but i couldnt a gone to sleep if id a wanted to i was in such a sweat to get through with the business by and by i heard the king and the duke come up so i rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder and waited to see if anything was going to happen but nothing did so i held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadnt begun yet and then i slipped down the ladder illustration a crack in the diningroom door chapter xxvii i crept to their doors and listened they was snoring so i tiptoed along and got down stairs all right there warnt a sound anywheres i peeped through a crack of the diningroom door and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs the door was open into the parlor where the corpse was laying and there was a candle in both rooms i passed along and the parlor door was open but i see there warnt nobody in there but the remainders of peter so i shoved on by but the front door was locked and the key wasnt there just then i heard somebody coming down the stairs back behind me i run in the parlor and took a swift look around and the only place i see to hide the bag was in the coffin the lid was shoved along about a foot showing the dead mans face down in there with a wet cloth over it and his shroud on i tucked the moneybag in under the lid just down beyond where his hands was crossed which made me creep they was so cold and then i run back across the room and in behind the door the person coming was mary jane she went to the coffin very soft and kneeled down and looked in then she put up her handkerchief and i see she begun to cry though i couldnt hear her and her back was to me i slid out and as i passed the diningroom i thought id make sure them watchers hadnt seen me so i looked through the crack and everything was all right they hadnt stirred i slipped up to bed feeling ruther blue on accounts of the thing playing out that way after i had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it says i if it could stay where it is all right because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two i could write back to mary jane and she could dig him up again and get it but that aint the thing thats going to happen the thing thats going to happen is the money ll be found when they come to screw on the lid then the king ll get it again and it ll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him of course i wanted to slide down and get it out of there but i dasnt try it every minute it was getting earlier now and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir and i might get catchedcatched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadnt hired me to take care of i dont wish to be mixed up in no such business as that i says to myself when i got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up and the watchers was gone there warnt nobody around but the family and the widow bartley and our tribe i watched their faces to see if anything had been happening but i couldnt tell towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs and then set all our chairs in rows and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the diningroom was full i see the coffin lid was the way it was before but i dasnt go to look in under it with folks around then the people begun to flock in and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin and for a half an hour the people filed around slow in single rank and looked down at the dead mans face a minute and some dropped in a tear and it was all very still and solemn only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent and sobbing a little there warnt no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing nosesbecause people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church when the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways putting on the last touches and getting people and things all shipshape and comfortable and making no more sound than a cat he never spoke he moved people around he squeezed in late ones he opened up passageways and done it with nods and signs with his hands then he took his place over against the wall he was the softest glidingest stealthiest man i ever see and there warnt no more smile to him than there is to a ham illustration the undertaker they had borrowed a melodeuma sick one and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it and it was pretty skreeky and colicky and everybody joined in and sung and peter was the only one that had a good thing according to my notion then the reverend hobson opened up slow and solemn and begun to talk and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard it was only one dog but he made a most powerful racket and he kept it up right along the parson he had to stand there over the coffin and waityou couldnt hear yourself think it was right down awkward and nobody didnt seem to know what to do but pretty soon they see that long legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say dont you worryjust depend on me then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall just his shoulders showing over the peoples heads so he glided along and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time and at last when he had gone around two sides of the room he disappears down cellar then in about two seconds we heard a whack and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two and then everything was dead still and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off in a minute or two here comes this undertakers back and shoulders gliding along the wall again and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room and then rose up and shaded his mouth with his hands and stretched his neck out towards the preacher over the peoples heads and says in a kind of a coarse whisper he had a rat then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place you could see it was a great satisfaction to the people because naturally they wanted to know a little thing like that dont cost nothing and its just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked there warnt no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was illustration he had a rat well the funeral sermon was very good but pison long and tiresome and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage and at last the job was through and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screwdriver i was in a sweat then and watched him pretty keen but he never meddled at all just slid the lid along as soft as mush and screwed it down tight and fast so there i was i didnt know whether the money was in there or not so says i spose somebody has hogged that bag on the slynow how do i know whether to write to mary jane or not spose she dug him up and didnt find nothing what would she think of me blame it i says i might get hunted up and jailed id better lay low and keep dark and not write at all the things awful mixed now trying to better it ive worsened it a hundred times and i wish to goodness id just let it alone dad fetch the whole business they buried him and we come back home and i went to watching faces againi couldnt help it and i couldnt rest easy but nothing come of it the faces didnt tell me nothing the king he visited around in the evening and sweetened everybody up and made himself ever so friendly and he give out the idea that his congregation over in england would be in a sweat about him so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home he was very sorry he was so pushed and so was everybody they wished he could stay longer but they said they could see it couldnt be done and he said of course him and william would take the girls home with them and that pleased everybody too because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations and it pleased the girls tootickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to they would be ready them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so but i didnt see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune well blamed if the king didnt bill the house and the niggers and all the property for auction straight offsale two days after the funeral but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to so the next day after the funeral along about noontime the girls joy got the first jolt a couple of nigger traders come along and the king sold them the niggers reasonable for threeday drafts as they called it and away they went the two sons up the river to memphis and their mother down the river to orleans i thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief they cried around each other and took on so it most made me down sick to see it the girls said they hadnt ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town i cant ever get it out of my memory the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each others necks and crying and i reckon i couldnt a stood it all but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if i hadnt knowed the sale warnt no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two the thing made a big stir in the town too and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way it injured the frauds some but the old fool he bulled right along spite of all the duke could say or do and i tell you the duke was powerful uneasy next day was auction day about broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up and i see by their look that there was trouble the king says was you in my room night before last no your majestywhich was the way i always called him when nobody but our gang warnt around illustration was you in my room was you in there yisterday er last night no your majesty honor bright nowno lies honor bright your majesty im telling you the truth i haint been anear your room since miss mary jane took you and the duke and showed it to you the duke says have you seen anybody else go in there no your grace not as i remember i believe stop and think i studied awhile and see my chance then i says well i see the niggers go in there several times both of them gave a little jump and looked like they hadnt ever expected it and then like they had then the duke says what all of them noleastways not all at oncethat is i dont think i ever see them all come out at once but just one time hello when was that it was the day we had the funeral in the morning it warnt early because i overslept i was just starting down the ladder and i see them well go on go on what did they do howd they act they didnt do nothing and they didnt act anyway much as fur as i see they tiptoed away so i seen easy enough that theyd shoved in there to do up your majestys room or something sposing you was up and found you warnt up and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up if they hadnt already waked you up great guns this is a go says the king and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly they stood there athinking and scratching their heads a minute and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle and says it does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand they let on to be sorry they was going out of this region and i believed they was sorry and so did you and so did everybody dont ever tell me any more that a nigger aint got any histrionic talent why the way they played that thing it would fool anybody in my opinion theres a fortune in em if i had capital and a theater i wouldnt want a better layout than thatand here weve gone and sold em for a song yes and aint privileged to sing the song yet say where is that songthat draft in the bank for to be collected where would it be well thats all right then thank goodness says i kind of timidlike is something gone wrong the king whirls on me and rips out none o your business you keep your head shet and mind yr own affairsif you got any long as youre in this town dont you forgit thatyou hear then he says to the duke we got to jest swaller it and say nothn mums the word for us as they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again and says quick sales and small profits its a good businessyes illustration jawing the king snarls around on him and says i was trying to do for the best in sellin em out so quick if the profits has turned out to be none lackin considable and none to carry is it my fault any moren its yourn well theyd be in this house yet and we wouldnt if i could a got my advice listened to the king sassed back as much as was safe for him and then swapped around and lit into me again he give me down the banks for not coming and telling him i see the niggers come out of his room acting that waysaid any fool would a knowed something was up and then waltzed in and cussed himself awhile and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning and hed be blamed if hed ever do it again so they went off ajawing and i felt dreadful glad id worked it all off on to the niggers and yet hadnt done the niggers no harm by it illustration in trouble chapter xxviii by and by it was gettingup time so i come down the ladder and started for downstairs but as i come to the girls room the door was open and i see mary jane setting by her old hair trunk which was open and shed been packing things in itgetting ready to go to england but she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap and had her face in her hands crying i felt awful bad to see it of course anybody would i went in there and says miss mary jane you cant abear to see people in trouble and i cantmost always tell me about it so she done it and it was the niggersi just expected it she said the beautiful trip to england was most about spoiled for her she didnt know how she was ever going to be happy there knowing the mother and the children warnt ever going to see each other no moreand then busted out bitterer than ever and flung up her hands and says oh dear dear to think they aint ever going to see each other any more but they willand inside of two weeksand i know it says i laws it was out before i could think and before i could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it again say it again say it again i see i had spoke too sudden and said too much and was in a close place i asked her to let me think a minute and she set there very impatient and excited and handsome but looking kind of happy and eased up like a person thats had a tooth pulled out so i went to studying it out i says to myself i reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks though i aint had no experience and cant say for certain but it looks so to me anyway and yet heres a case where im blest if it dont look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie i must lay it by in my mind and think it over some time or other its so kind of strange and unregular i never see nothing like it well i says to myself at last im agoing to chance it ill up and tell the truth this time though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where youll go to then i says miss mary jane is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days yes mr lothrops why never mind why yet if ill tell you how i know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weekshere in this houseand prove how i know itwill you go to mr lothrops and stay four days four days she says ill stay a year all right i says i dont want nothing more out of you than just your wordi druther have it than another mans kissthebible she smiled and reddened up very sweet and i says if you dont mind it ill shut the doorand bolt it then i come back and set down again and says dont you holler just set still and take it like a man i got to tell the truth and you want to brace up miss mary because its a bad kind and going to be hard to take but there aint no help for it these uncles of yourn aint no uncles at all theyre a couple of fraudsregular deadbeats there now were over the worst of it you can stand the rest middling easy it jolted her up like everything of course but i was over the shoal water now so i went right along her eyes ablazing higher and higher all the time and told her every blame thing from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat clear through to where she flung herself on to the kings breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen timesand then up she jumps with her face afire like sunset and says the brute come dont waste a minutenot a secondwell have them tarred and feathered and flung in the river illustration indignation says i certnly but do you mean before you go to mr lothrops or oh she says what am i thinking about she says and set right down again dont mind what i saidplease dontyou wont now will you laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that i said i would die first i never thought i was so stirred up she says now go on and i wont do so any more you tell me what to do and whatever you say ill do it well i says its a rough gang them two frauds and im fixed so i got to travel with them a while longer whether i want to or noti druther not tell you why and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws and id be all right but thered be another person that you dont know about whod be in big trouble well we got to save him haint we of course well then we wont blow on them saying them words put a good idea in my head i see how maybe i could get me and jim rid of the frauds get them jailed here and then leave but i didnt want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me so i didnt want the plan to begin working till pretty late tonight i says miss mary jane ill tell you what well do and you wont have to stay at mr lothrops so long nuther how fur is it a little short of four milesright out in the country back here well that ll answer now you go along out there and lay low till nine or halfpast tonight and then get them to fetch you home againtell them youve thought of something if you get here before eleven put a candle in this window and if i dont turn up wait till eleven and then if i dont turn up it means im gone and out of the way and safe then you come out and spread the news around and get these beats jailed good she says ill do it and if it just happens so that i dont get away but get took up along with them you must up and say i told you the whole thing beforehand and you must stand by me all you can stand by you indeed i will they shant touch a hair of your head she says and i see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it too if i get away i shant be here i says to prove these rapscallions aint your uncles and i couldnt do it if i was here i could swear they was beats and bummers thats all though thats worth something well theres others can do that better than what i can and theyre people that aint going to be doubted as quick as id be ill tell you how to find them gimme a pencil and a piece of paper thereroyal nonesuch bricksville put it away and dont lose it when the court wants to find out something about these two let them send up to bricksville and say theyve got the men that played the royal nonesuch and ask for some witnesseswhy youll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink miss mary and theyll come abiling too illustration how to find them i judged we had got everything fixed about right now so i says just let the auction go right along and dont worry nobody dont have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice and they aint going out of this till they get that money and the way weve fixed it the sale aint going to count and they aint going to get no money its just like the way it was with the niggersit warnt no sale and the niggers will be back before long why they cant collect the money for the niggers yettheyre in the worst kind of a fix miss mary well she says ill run down to breakfast now and then ill start straight for mr lothrops deed that aint the ticket miss mary jane i says by no manner of means go before breakfast why what did you reckon i wanted you to go at all for miss mary well i never thoughtand come to think i dont know what was it why its because you aint one of these leatherface people i dont want no better book than what your face is a body can set down and read it off like coarse print do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you goodmorning and never there there dont yes ill go before breakfastill be glad to and leave my sisters with them yes never mind about them theyve got to stand it yet a while they might suspicion something if all of you was to go i dont want you to see them nor your sisters nor nobody in this town if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something no you go right along miss mary jane and ill fix it with all of them ill tell miss susan to give your love to your uncles and say youve went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change or to see a friend and youll be back tonight or early in the morning gone to see a friend is all right but i wont have my love given to them well then it shant be it was well enough to tell her sono harm in it it was only a little thing to do and no trouble and its the little things that smooths peoples roads the most down here below it would make mary jane comfortable and it wouldnt cost nothing then i says theres one more thingthat bag of money well theyve got that and it makes me feel pretty silly to think how they got it no youre out there they haint got it why whos got it i wish i knowed but i dont i had it because i stole it from them and i stole it to give to you and i know where i hid it but im afraid it aint there no more im awful sorry miss mary jane im just as sorry as i can be but i done the best i could i did honest i come nigh getting caught and i had to shove it into the first place i come to and runand it warnt a good place oh stop blaming yourselfits too bad to do it and i wont allow ityou couldnt help it it wasnt your fault where did you hide it i didnt want to set her to thinking about her troubles again and i couldnt seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach so for a minute i didnt say nothing then i says id ruther not tell you where i put it miss mary jane if you dont mind letting me off but ill write it for you on a piece of paper and you can read it along the road to mr lothrops if you want to do you reckon that ll do oh yes so i wrote i put it in the coffin it was in there when you was crying there away in the night i was behind the door and i was mighty sorry for you miss mary jane illustration he wrote it made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night and them devils laying there right under her own roof shaming her and robbing her and when i folded it up and give it to her i see the water come into her eyes too and she shook me by the hand hard and says goodbye im going to do everything just as youve told me and if i dont ever see you again i shant ever forget you and ill think of you a many and a many a time and ill pray for you tooand she was gone pray for me i reckoned if she knowed me shed take a job that was more nearer her size but i bet she done it just the sameshe was just that kind she had the grit to pray for judus if she took the notionthere warnt no backdown to her i judge you may say what you want to but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl i ever see in my opinion she was just full of sand it sounds like flattery but it aint no flattery and when it comes to beautyand goodness tooshe lays over them all i haint ever seen her since that time that i see her go out of that door no i haint ever seen her since but i reckon ive thought of her a many and a many a million times and of her saying she would pray for me and if ever id a thought it would do any good for me to pray for her blamed if i wouldnt a done it or bust well mary jane she lit out the back way i reckon because nobody see her go when i struck susan and the harelip i says whats the name of them people over on tother side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes they says theres several but its the proctors mainly thats the name i says i most forgot it well miss mary jane she told me to tell you shes gone over there in a dreadful hurryone of thems

different its a new kind miss mary jane said illustration hanner with the mumps hows it a new kind because its mixed up with other things what other things well measles and whoopingcough and erysiplas and consumption and yaller janders and brainfever and i dont know what all my land and they call it the mumps thats what miss mary jane said well what in the nation do they call it the mumps for why because it is the mumps thats what it starts with well ther aint no sense in it a body might stump his toe and take pison and fall down the well and break his neck and bust his brains out and somebody come along and ask what killed him and some numskull up and say why he stumped his toe would ther be any sense in that no and ther aint no sense in this nuther is it ketching is it ketching why how you talk is a harrow catchingin the dark if you dont hitch on to one tooth youre bound to on another aint you and you cant get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along can you well these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow as you may sayand it aint no slouch of a harrow nuther you come to get it hitched on good well its awful i think says the harelip ill go to uncle harvey and oh yes i says i would of course i would i wouldnt lose no time well why wouldnt you just look at it a minute and maybe you can see haint your uncles obleegd to get along home to england as fast as they can and do you reckon theyd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves you know theyll wait for you so fur so good your uncle harveys a preacher aint he very well then is a preacher going to deceive a steamboat clerk is he going to deceive a ship clerkso as to get them to let miss mary jane go aboard now you know he aint what will he do then why hell say its a great pity but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribusunum mumps and so its my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if shes got it but never mind if you think its best to tell your uncle harvey shucks and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in england whilst we was waiting to find out whether mary janes got it or not why you talk like a muggins well anyway maybe youd better tell some of the neighbors listen at that now you do beat all for natural stupidness cant you see that theyd go and tell ther aint no way but just to not tell anybody at all well maybe youre rightyes i judge you are right but i reckon we ought to tell uncle harvey shes gone out a while anyway so he wont be uneasy about her yes miss mary jane she wanted you to do that she says tell them to give uncle harvey and william my love and a kiss and say ive run over the river to see mrmrwhat is the name of that rich family your uncle peter used to think so much ofi mean the one that why you must mean the apthorps aint it of course bother them kind of names a body cant ever seem to remember them half the time somehow yes she said say she has run over for to ask the apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house because she allowed her uncle peter would ruther they had it than anybody else and shes going to stick to them till they say theyll come and then if she aint too tired shes coming home and if she is shell be home in the morning anyway she said dont say nothing about the proctors but only about the apthorpswhich ll be perfectly true because she is going there to speak about their buying the house i know it because she told me so herself all right they said and cleared out to lay for their uncles and give them the love and the kisses and tell them the message everything was all right now the girls wouldnt say nothing because they wanted to go to england and the king and the duke would ruther mary jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of doctor robinson i felt very good i judged i had done it pretty neati reckoned tom sawyer couldnt a done it no neater himself of course he would a throwed more style into it but i cant do that very handy not being brung up to it well they held the auction in the public square along towards the end of the afternoon and it strung along and strung along and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest up there longside of the auctioneer and chipping in a little scripture now and then or a little goodygoody saying of some kind and the duke he was around googooing for sympathy all he knowed how and just spreading himself generly illustration the auction but by and by the thing dragged through and everything was soldeverything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard so theyd got to work that offi never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow everything well whilst they was at it a steamboat landed and in about two minutes up comes a crowd awhooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on and singing out heres your opposition line heres your two sets o heirs to old peter wilksand you pays your money and you takes your choice illustration the true brothers chapter xxix they was fetching a very nicelooking old gentleman along and a nice looking younger one with his right arm in a sling and my souls how the people yelled and laughed and kept it up but i didnt see no joke about it and i judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any i reckoned theyd turn pale but no nary a pale did they turn the duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up but just went a googooing around happy and satisfied like a jug thats googling out buttermilk and as for the king he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them newcomers like it give him the stomachache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world oh he done it admirable lots of the principal people gethered around the king to let him see they was on his side that old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death pretty soon he begun to speak and i see straight off he pronounced like an englishmannot the kings way though the kings was pretty good for an imitation i cant give the old gents words nor i cant imitate him but he turned around to the crowd and says about like this this is a surprise to me which i wasnt looking for and ill acknowledge candid and frank i aint very well fixed to meet it and answer it for my brother and me has had misfortunes hes broke his arm and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake i am peter wilks brother harvey and this is his brother william which cant hear nor speakand cant even make signs to amount to much nowt hes only got one hand to work them with we are who we say we are and in a day or two when i get the baggage i can prove it but up till then i wont say nothing more but go to the hotel and wait so him and the new dummy started off and the king he laughs and blethers out broke his armvery likely aint itand very convenient too for a fraud thats got to make signs and aint learnt how lost their baggage thats mighty goodand mighty ingeniousunder the circumstances so he laughed again and so did everybody else except three or four or maybe half a dozen one of these was that doctor another one was a sharplooking gentleman with a carpetbag of the oldfashioned kind made out of carpetstuff that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their headsit was levi bell the lawyer that was gone up to louisville and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said and was listening to the king now and when the king got done this husky up and says say looky here if you are harvey wilks whend you come to this town the day before the funeral friend says the king but what time o day in the eveninbout an hour er two before sundown howd you come i come down on the susan powell from cincinnati well then howd you come to be up at the pint in the morninin a canoe i warnt up at the pint in the mornin its a lie several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher preacher be hanged hes a fraud and a liar he was up at the pint that mornin i live up there dont i well i was up there and he was up there i see him there he come in a canoe along with tim collins and a boy the doctor he up and says would you know the boy again if you was to see him hines i reckon i would but i dont know why yonder he is now i know him perfectly easy it was me he pointed at the doctor says neighbors i dont know whether the new couple is frauds or not but if these two aint frauds i am an idiot thats all i think its our duty to see that they dont get away from here till weve looked into this thing come along hines come along the rest of you well take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with tother couple and i reckon well find out something before we get through it was nuts for the crowd though maybe not for the kings friends so we all started it was about sundown the doctor he led me along by the hand and was plenty kind enough but he never let go my hand illustration the doctor leads huck we all got in a big room in the hotel and lit up some candles and fetched in the new couple first the doctor says i dont wish to be too hard on these two men but i think theyre frauds and they may have complices that we dont know nothing about if they have wont the complices get away with that bag of gold peter wilks left it aint unlikely if these men aint frauds they wont object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove theyre all rightaint that so everybody agreed to that so i judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart but the king he only looked sorrowful and says gentlemen i wish the money was there for i aint got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair open outandout investigation o this misable business but alas the money aint there you kn send and see if you want to where is it then well when my niece give it to me to keep for her i took and hid it inside o the straw tick o my bed not wishin to bank it for the few days wed be here and considerin the bed a safe place we not bein used to niggers and supposn em honest like servants in england the niggers stole it the very next mornin after i had went down stairs and when i sold em i hadnt missed the money yit so they got clean away with it my servant here kn tell you bout it gentlemen the doctor and several said shucks and i see nobody didnt altogether believe him one man asked me if i see the niggers steal it i said no but i see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away and i never thought nothing only i reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them that was all they asked me then the doctor whirls on me and says are you english too i says yes and him and some others laughed and said stuff well then they sailed in on the general investigation and there we had it up and down hour in hour out and nobody never said a word about supper nor ever seemed to think about itand so they kept it up and kept it up and it was the worst mixedup thing you ever see they made the king tell his yarn and they made the old gentleman tell hisn and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a seen that the old gentleman was spinning truth and tother one lies and by and by they had me up to tell what i knowed the king he give me a lefthanded look out of the corner of his eye and so i knowed enough to talk on the right side i begun to tell about sheffield and how we lived there and all about the english wilkses and so on but i didnt get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh and levi bell the lawyer says set down my boy i wouldnt strain myself if i was you i reckon you aint used to lying it dont seem to come handy what you want is practice you do it pretty awkward i didnt care nothing for the compliment but i was glad to be let off anyway the doctor he started to say something and turns and says if youd been in town at first levi bell the king broke in and reached out his hand and says why is this my poor dead brothers old friend that hes wrote so often about the lawyer and him shook hands and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased and they talked right along awhile and then got to one side and talked low and at last the lawyer speaks up and says that ll fix it ill take the order and send it along with your brothers and then theyll know its all right so they got some paper and a pen and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side and chawed his tongue and scrawled off something and then they give the pen to the dukeand then for the first time the duke looked sick but he took the pen and wrote so then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says you and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names illustration the duke wrote the old gentleman wrote but nobody couldnt read it the lawyer looked powerful astonished and says well it beats meand snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket and examined them and then examined the old mans writing and then them again and then says these old letters is from harvey wilks and heres these two handwritings and anybody can see they didnt write them the king and the duke looked sold and foolish i tell you to see how the lawyer had took them in and heres this old gentlemans hand writing and anybody can tell easy enough he didnt write themfact is the scratches he makes aint properly writing at all now heres some letters from the new old gentleman says if you please let me explain nobody can read my hand but my brother thereso he copies for me its his hand youve got there not mine well says the lawyer this is a state of things ive got some of williams letters too so if youll get him to write a line or so we can com he cant write with his left hand says the old gentleman if he could use his right hand you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too look at both pleasetheyre by the same hand the lawyer done it and says i believe its soand if it aint so theres a heap stronger resemblance than id noticed before anyway well well well i thought we was right on the track of a solution but its gone to grass partly but anyway one thing is provedthese two aint either of em wilksesand he wagged his head towards the king and the duke well what do you think that muleheaded old fool wouldnt give in then indeed he wouldnt said it warnt no fair test said his brother william was the cussedest joker in the world and hadnt tried to writehe see william was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper and so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying himself but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in and says ive thought of something is there anybody here that helped to lay out my brhelped to lay out the late peter wilks for burying yes says somebody me and ab turner done it were both here then the old man turns towards the king and says perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast blamed if the king didnt have to brace up mighty quick or hed a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under it took him so sudden and mind you it was a thing that was calculated to make most anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice because how was he going to know what was tattooed on the man he whitened a little he couldnt help it and it was mighty still in there and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him says i to myself now hell throw up the spongethere aint no more use well did he a body cant hardly believe it but he didnt i reckon he thought hed keep the thing up till he tired them people out so theyd thin out and him and the duke could break loose and get away anyway he set there and pretty soon he begun to smile and says mf its a very tough question aint it yes sir i kn tell you whats tattooed on his breast its jest a small thin blue arrowthats what it is and if you dont look clost you cant see it now what do you sayhey well i never see anything like that old blister for clean outandout cheek the new old gentleman turns brisk towards ab turner and his pard and his eye lights up like he judged hed got the king this time and says thereyouve heard what he said was there any such mark on peter wilks breast both of them spoke up and says we didnt see no such mark good says the old gentleman now what you did see on his breast was a small dim p and a b which is an initial he dropped when he was young and a w with dashes between them so pbwand he marked them that way on a piece of paper come aint that what you saw both of them spoke up again and says no we didnt we never seen any marks at all well everybody was in a state of mind now and they sings out the whole bilin of m s frauds les duck em les drown em les ride em on a rail and everybody was whooping at once and there was a rattling powwow but the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells and says gentlemengentlemen hear me just a wordjust a single wordif you please theres one way yetlets go and dig up the corpse and look illustration gentlemengentlemen that took them hooray they all shouted and was starting right off but the lawyer and the doctor sung out hold on hold on collar all these four men and the boy and fetch them along too well do it they all shouted and if we dont find them marks well lynch the whole gang i was scared now i tell you but there warnt no getting away you know they gripped us all and marched us right along straight for the graveyard which was a mile and a half down the river and the whole town at our heels for we made noise enough and it was only nine in the evening as we went by our house i wished i hadnt sent mary jane out of town because now if i could tip her the wink shed light out and save me and blow on our deadbeats well we swarmed along down the river road just carrying on like wildcats and to make it more scary the sky was darking up and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves this was the most awful trouble and most dangersome i ever was in and i was kinder stunned everything was going so different from what i had allowed for stead of being fixed so i could take my own time if i wanted to and see all the fun and have mary jane at my back to save me and set me free when the closefit come here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoomarks if they didnt find them i couldnt bear to think about it and yet somehow i couldnt think about nothing else it got darker and darker and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip but that big husky had me by the wristhinesand a body might as well try to give goliar the slip he dragged me right along he was so excited and i had to run to keep up when they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow and when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted but nobody hadnt thought to fetch a lantern but they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning and sent a man to the nearest house a half a mile off to borrow one so they dug and dug like everything and it got awful dark and the rain started and the wind swished and swushed along and the lightning come brisker and brisker and the thunder boomed but them people never took no notice of it they was so full of this business and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave and the next second the dark wiped it all out and you couldnt see nothing at all at last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was to scrouge in and get a sight you never see and in the dark that way it was awful hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so and i reckon he clean forgot i was in the world he was so excited and panting all of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare and somebody sings out by the living jingo heres the bag of gold on his breast hines let out a whoop like everybody else and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look and the way i lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there aint nobody can tell i had the road all to myself and i fairly flewleastways i had it all to myself except the solid dark and the nowandthen glares and the buzzing of the rain and the thrashing of the wind and the splitting of the thunder and sure as you are born i did clip it along when i struck the town i see there warnt nobody out in the storm so i never hunted for no back streets but humped it straight through the main one and when i begun to get towards our house i aimed my eye and set it no light there the house all darkwhich made me feel sorry and disappointed i didnt know why but at last just as i was sailing by flash comes the light in mary janes window and my heart swelled up sudden like to bust and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark and wasnt ever going to be before me no more in this world she was the best girl i ever see and had the most sand the minute i was far enough above the town to see i could make the towhead i begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasnt chained i snatched it and shoved it was a canoe and warnt fastened with nothing but a rope the towhead was a rattling big distance off away out there in the middle of the river but i didnt lose no time and when i struck the raft at last i was so fagged i would a just laid down to blow and gasp if i could afforded it but i didnt as i sprung aboard i sung out out with you jim and set her loose glory be to goodness were shut of them illustration jim let out jim lit out and was acoming for me with both arms spread he was so full of joy but when i glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and i went overboard backwards for i forgot he was old king lear and a drownded arab all in one and it most scared the livers and lights out of me but jim fished me out and was going to hug me and bless me and so on he was so glad i was back and we was shut of the king and the duke but i says not now have it for breakfast have it for breakfast cut loose and let her slide so in two seconds away we went asliding down the river and it did seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river and nobody to bother us i had to skip around a bit and jump up and crack my heels a few timesi couldnt help it but about the third crack i noticed a sound that i knowed mighty well and held my breath and listened and waited and sure enough when the next flash busted out over the water here they comeand just alaying to their oars and making their skiff hum it was the king and the duke so i wilted right down on to the planks then and give up and it was all i could do to keep from crying illustration the king shakes huck chapter xxx when they got aboard the king went for me and shook me by the collar and says tryin to give us the slip was ye you pup tired of our company hey i says no your majesty we warntplease dont your majesty quick then and tell us what was your idea or ill shake the insides out o you honest ill tell you everything just as it happened your majesty the man that had aholt of me was very good to me and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold and made a rush for the coffin he lets go of me and whispers heel it now or theyll hang ye sure and i lit out it didnt seem no good for me to stayi couldnt do nothing and i didnt want to be hung if i could get away so i never stopped running till i found the canoe and when i got here i told jim to hurry or theyd catch me and hang me yet and said i was afeard you and the duke wasnt alive now and i was awful sorry and so was jim and was awful glad when we see you coming you may ask jim if i didnt jim said it was so and the king told him to shut up and said oh yes its mighty likely and shook me up again and said he reckoned hed drownd me but the duke says leggo the boy you old idiot would you a done any different did you inquire around for him when you got loose i dont remember it so the king let go of me and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it but the duke says you better a blame sight give yourself a good cussing for youre the one thats entitled to it most you haint done a thing from the start that had any sense in it except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary bluearrow mark that was brightit was right down bully and it was the thing that saved us for if it hadnt been for that theyd a jailed us till them englishmens baggage comeand thenthe penitentiary you bet but that trick took em to the graveyard and the gold done us a still bigger kindness for if the excited fools hadnt let go all holts and made that rush to get a look wed a slept in our cravats to nightcravats warranted to wear toolonger than wed need em they was still a minutethinking then the king says kind of absent minded like mf and we reckoned the niggers stole it that made me squirm yes says the duke kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic we did after about a half a minute the king drawls out leastways i did the duke says the same way on the contrary i did the king kind of ruffles up and says looky here bilgewater whatr you referrin to the duke says pretty brisk when it comes to that maybe youll let me ask what was you referring to shucks says the king very sarcastic but i dont knowmaybe you was asleep and didnt know what you was about the duke bristles up now and says oh let up on this cussed nonsense do you take me for a blame fool dont you reckon i know who hid that money in that coffin yes sir i know you do know because you done it yourself its a lieand the duke went for him the king sings out take yr hands offleggo my throati take it all back illustration the duke went for him the duke says well you just own up first that you did hide that money there intending to give me the slip one of these days and come back and dig it up and have it all to yourself wait jest a minute dukeanswer me this one question honest and fair if you didnt put the money there say it and ill blieve you and take back everything i said you old scoundrel i didnt and you know i didnt there now well then i blieve you but answer me only jest this one morenow dont git mad didnt you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it the duke never said nothing for a little bit then he says well i dont care if i did i didnt do it anyway but you not only had it in mind to do it but you done it i wisht i never die if i done it duke and thats honest i wont say i warnt goin to do it because i was but youi mean somebodygot in ahead o me its a lie you done it and you got to say you done it or the king began to gurgle and then he gasps out noughi own up i was very glad to hear him say that it made me feel much more easier than what i was feeling before so the duke took his hands off and says if you ever deny it again ill drown you its well for you to set there and blubber like a babyits fitten for you after the way youve acted i never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everythingand i atrusting you all the time like you was my own father you ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers and you never say a word for em it makes me feel ridiculous to think i was soft enough to believe that rubbage cuss you i can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisityou wanted to get what money id got out of the nonesuch and one thing or another and scoop it all the king says timid and still asnuffling why duke it was you that said make up the deffisit it warnt me dry up i dont want to hear no more out of you says the duke and now you see what you got by it theyve got all their own money back and all of ourn but a shekel or two besides glong to bed and dont you deffersit me no more deffersits long s you live so the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort and before long the duke tackled his bottle and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again and the tighter they got the lovinger they got and went off asnoring in each others arms they both got powerful mellow but i noticed the king didnt get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the moneybag again that made me feel easy and satisfied of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble and i told jim everything illustration spanish moss chapter xxxi we dasnt stop again at any town for days and days kept right along down the river we was down south in the warm weather now and a mighty long ways from home we begun to come to trees with spanish moss on them hanging down from the limbs like long gray beards it was the first i ever see it growing and it made the woods look solemn and dismal so now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger and they begun to work the villages again first they done a lecture on temperance but they didnt make enough for them both to get drunk on then in another village they started a dancingschool but they didnt know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town another time they tried to go at yellocution but they didnt yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing and made them skip out they tackled missionarying and mesmerizing and doctoring and telling fortunes and a little of everything but they couldnt seem to have no luck so at last they got just about dead broke and laid around the raft as she floated along thinking and thinking and never saying nothing by the half a day at a time and dreadful blue and desperate and at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time jim and me got uneasy we didnt like the look of it we judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever we turned it over and over and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebodys house or store or was going into the counterfeitmoney business or something so then we was pretty scared and made up an agreement that we wouldnt have nothing in the world to do with such actions and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind well early one morning we hid the raft in a good safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named pikesville and the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the royal nonesuch there yet house to rob you mean says i to myself and when you get through robbing it youll come back here and wonder what has become of me and jim and the raftand youll have to take it out in wondering and he said if he warnt back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right and we was to come along so we stayed where we was the duke he fretted and sweated around and was in a mighty sour way he scolded us for everything and we couldnt seem to do nothing right he found fault with every little thing something was abrewing sure i was good and glad when midday come and no king we could have a change anywayand maybe a chance for the change on top of it so me and the duke went up to the village and hunted around there for the king and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery very tight and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport and he acussing and athreatening with all his might and so tight he couldnt walk and couldnt do nothing to them the duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool and the king begun to sass back and the minute they was fairly at it i lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs and spun down the river road like a deer for i see our chance and i made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and jim again i got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy and sung out set her loose jim were all right now but there warnt no answer and nobody come out of the wigwam jim was gone i set up a shoutand then anotherand then another one and run this way and that in the woods whooping and screeching but it warnt no useold jim was gone then i set down and cried i couldnt help it but i couldnt set still long pretty soon i went out on the road trying to think what i better do and i run across a boy walking and asked him if hed seen a strange nigger dressed so and so and he says yes whereabouts says i down to silas phelps place two mile below here hes a runaway nigger and theyve got him was you looking for him you bet i aint i run across him in the woods about an hour or two ago and he said if i hollered hed cut my livers outand told me to lay down and stay where i was and i done it been there ever since afeard to come out well he says you neednt be afeard no more becuz theyve got him he run off fm down south somers its a good job they got him well i reckon theres two hunderd dollars reward on him its like picking up money outn the road yes it isand i could a had it if id been big enough i see him first who nailed him illustration who nailed him it was an old fellowa strangerand he sold out his chance in him for forty dollars becuz hes got to go up the river and cant wait think o that now you bet id wait if it was seven year thats me every time says i but maybe his chance aint worth no more than that if hell sell it so cheap maybe theres something aint straight about it but it is thoughstraight as a string i see the handbill myself it tells all about him to a dotpaints him like a picture and tells the plantation hes frum below newrleans nosirreebob they aint no trouble bout that speculation you bet you say gimme a chaw tobacker wont ye i didnt have none so he left i went to the raft and set down in the wigwam to think but i couldnt come to nothing i thought till i wore my head sore but i couldnt see no way out of the trouble after all this long journey and after all wed done for them scoundrels here it was all come to nothing everything all busted up and ruined because they could have the heart to serve jim such a trick as that and make him a slave again all his life and amongst strangers too for forty dirty dollars once i said to myself it would be a thousand times better for jim to be a slave at home where his family was as long as hed got to be a slave and so id better write a letter to tom sawyer and tell him to tell miss watson where he was but i soon give up that notion for two things shed be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her and so shed sell him straight down the river again and if she didnt everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger and theyd make jim feel it all the time and so hed feel ornery and disgraced and then think of me it would get all around that huck finn helped a nigger to get his freedom and if i was ever to see anybody from that town again id be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame thats just the way a person does a lowdown thing and then he dont want to take no consequences of it thinks as long as he can hide it it aint no disgrace that was my fix exactly the more i studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me and the more wicked and lowdown and ornery i got to feeling and at last when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven whilst i was stealing a poor old womans nigger that hadnt ever done me no harm and now was showing me theres one thats always on the lookout and aint agoing to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further i most dropped in my tracks i was so scared well i tried the best i could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying i was brung up wicked and so i warnt so much to blame but something inside of me kept saying there was the sundayschool you could a gone to it and if youd a done it theyd a learnt you there that people that acts as id been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire it made me shiver and i about made up my mind to pray and see if i couldnt try to quit being the kind of a boy i was and be better so i kneeled down but the words wouldnt come why wouldnt they it warnt no use to try and hide it from him nor from me neither i knowed very well why they wouldnt come it was because my heart warnt right it was because i warnt square it was because i was playing double i was letting on to give up sin but away inside of me i was holding on to the biggest one of all i was trying to make my mouth say i would do the right thing and the clean thing and go and write to that niggers owner and tell where he was but deep down in me i knowed it was a lie and he knowed it you cant pray a liei found that out so i was full of trouble full as i could be and didnt know what to do at last i had an idea and i says ill go and write the letterand then see if i can pray why it was astonishing the way i felt as light as a feather right straight off and my troubles all gone so i got a piece of paper and a pencil all glad and excited and set down and wrote miss watson your runaway nigger jim is down here two mile below pikesville and mr phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send huck finn illustration thinking i felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time i had ever felt so in my life and i knowed i could pray now but i didnt do it straight off but laid the paper down and set there thinkingthinking how good it was all this happened so and how near i come to being lost and going to hell and went on thinking and got to thinking over our trip down the river and i see jim before me all the time in the day and in the nighttime sometimes moonlight sometimes storms and we afloating along talking and singing and laughing but somehow i couldnt seem to strike no places to harden me against him but only the other kind id see him standing my watch on top of hisn stead of calling me so i could go on sleeping and see him how glad he was when i come back out of the fog and when i come to him again in the swamp up there where the feud was and suchlike times and would always call me honey and pet me and do everything he could think of for me and how good he always was and at last i struck the time i saved him by telling the men we had smallpox aboard and he was so grateful and said i was the best friend old jim ever had in the world and the only one hes got now and then i happened to look around and see that paper it was a close place i took it up and held it in my hand i was atrembling because id got to decide forever betwixt two things and i knowed it i studied a minute sort of holding my breath and then says to myself all right then ill go to helland tore it up it was awful thoughts and awful words but they was said and i let them stay said and never thought no more about reforming i shoved the whole thing out of my head and said i would take up wickedness again which was in my line being brung up to it and the other warnt and for a starter i would go to work and steal jim out of slavery again and if i could think up anything worse i would do that too because as long as i was in and in for good i might as well go the whole hog then i set to thinking over how to get at it and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind and at last fixed up a plan that suited me so then i took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece and as soon as it was fairly dark i crept out with my raft and went for it and hid it there and then turned in i slept the night through and got up before it was light and had my breakfast and put on my store clothes and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle and took the canoe and cleared for shore i landed below where i judged was phelpss place and hid my bundle in the woods and then filled up the canoe with water and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where i could find her again when i wanted her about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank then i struck up the road and when i passed the mill i see a sign on it phelpss sawmill and when i come to the farmhouses two or three hundred yards further along i kept my eyes peeled but didnt see nobody around though it was good daylight now but i didnt mind because i didnt want to see nobody just yeti only wanted to get the lay of the land according to my plan i was going to turn up there from the village not from below so i just took a look and shoved along straight for town well the very first man i see when i got there was the duke he was sticking up a bill for the royal nonesuchthreenight performancelike that other time they had the cheek them frauds i was right on him before i could shirk he looked astonished and says hello whered you come from then he says kind of glad and eager wheres the raftgot her in a good place i says why thats just what i was going to ask your grace then he didnt look so joyful and says what was your idea for asking me he says well i says when i see the king in that doggery yesterday i says to myself we cant get him home for hours till hes soberer so i went aloafing around town to put in the time and wait a man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep and so i went along but when we was dragging him to the boat and the man left me aholt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run and we after him we didnt have no dog and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out we never got him till dark then we fetched him over and i started down for the raft when i got there and see it was gone i says to myself theyve got into trouble and had to leave and theyve took my nigger which is the only nigger ive got in the world and now im in a strange country and aint got no property no more nor nothing and no way to make my living so i set down and cried i slept in the woods all night but what did become of the raft thenand jimpoor jim blamed if i knowthat is whats become of the raft that old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched halfdollars with him and got every cent but what hed spent for whisky and when i got him home late last night and found the raft gone we said that little rascal has stole our raft and shook us and run off down the river i wouldnt shake my nigger would ithe only nigger i had in the world and the only property we never thought of that fact is i reckon wed come to consider him our nigger yes we did consider him sogoodness knows we had trouble enough for him so when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke there warnt anything for it but to try the royal nonesuch another shake and ive pegged along ever since dry as a powderhorn wheres that ten cents give it here illustration he gave him ten cents i had considerable money so i give him ten cents but begged him to spend it for something to eat and give me some because it was all the money i had and i hadnt had nothing to eat since yesterday he never said nothing the next minute he whirls on me and says do you reckon that nigger would blow on us wed skin him if he done that how can he blow haint he run off no that old fool sold him and never divided with me and the moneys gone sold him i says and begun to cry why he was my nigger and that was my money where is hei want my nigger well you cant get your nigger thats allso dry up your blubbering looky heredo you think youd venture to blow on us blamed if i think id trust you why if you was to blow on us he stopped but i never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before i went on awhimpering and says i dont want to blow on nobody and i aint got no time to blow nohow i got to turn out and find my nigger he looked kinder bothered and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm thinking and wrinkling up his forehead at last he says ill tell you something we got to be here three days if youll promise you wont blow and wont let the nigger blow ill tell you where to find him so i promised and he says a farmer by the name of silas ph and then he stopped you see he started to tell me the truth but when he stopped that way and begun to study and think again i reckoned he was changing his mind and so he was he wouldnt trust me he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days so pretty soon he says the man that bought him is named abram fosterabram g fosterand he lives forty mile back here in the country on the road to lafayette all right i says i can walk it in three days and ill start this very afternoon no you wont youll start now and dont you lose any time about it neither nor do any gabbling by the way just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along and then you wont get into trouble with us dye hear that was the order i wanted and that was the one i played for i wanted to be left free to work my plans so clear out he says and you can tell mr foster whatever you want to maybe you can get him to believe that jim is your niggersome idiots dont require documentsleastways ive heard theres such down south here and when you tell him the handbill and the rewards bogus maybe hell believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting em out go long now and tell him anything you want to but mind you dont work your jaw any between here and there illustration striking for the back country so i left and struck for the back country i didnt look around but i kinder felt like he was watching me but i knowed i could tire him out at that i went straight out in the country as much as a mile before i stopped then i doubled back through the woods towards phelps i reckoned i better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around because i wanted to stop jims mouth till these fellows could get away i didnt want no trouble with their kind id seen all i wanted to of them and wanted to get entirely shut of them illustration still and sunday like chapter xxxii when i got there it was all still and sundaylike and hot and sunshiny the hands was gone to the fields and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybodys dead and gone and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful because you feel like its spirits whisperingspirits thats been dead ever so many yearsand you always think theyre talking about you as a general thing it makes a body wish he was dead too and done with it all phelps was one of these little onehorse cotton plantations and they all look alike a rail fence round a twoacre yard a stile made out of logs sawed off and upended in steps like barrels of a different length to climb over the fence with and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse some sickly grasspatches in the big yard but mostly it was bare and smooth like an old hat with the nap rubbed off big double loghouse for the white folkshewed logs with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar and these mudstripes been whitewashed some time or another roundlog kitchen with a big broad open but roofed passage joining it to the house log smokehouse back of the kitchen three little log niggercabins in a row tother side the smokehouse one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence and some outbuildings down a piece the other side ash hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut bench by the kitchen door with bucket of water and a gourd hound asleep there in the sun more hounds asleep round about about three shade trees away off in a corner some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch then the cotton fields begins and after the fields the woods i went around and clumb over the back stile by the ashhopper and started for the kitchen when i got a little ways i heard the dim hum of a spinningwheel wailing along up and sinking along down again and then i knowed for certain i wished i was deadfor that is the lonesomest sound in the whole world i went right along not fixing up any particular plan but just trusting to providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come for id noticed that providence always did put the right words in my mouth if i left it alone when i got halfway first one hound and then another got up and went for me and of course i stopped and faced them and kept still and such another powwow as they made in a quarter of a minute i was a kind of a hub of a wheel as you may sayspokes made out of dogscircle of fifteen of them packed together around me with their necks and noses stretched up towards me abarking and howling and more acoming you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres a nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rollingpin in her hand singing out begone you tige you spot begone sah and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling and then the rest followed and the next second half of them come back wagging their tails around me and making friends with me there aint no harm in a hound nohow and behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but towlinen shirts and they hung on to their mothers gown and peeped out from behind her at me bashful the way they always do and here comes the white woman running from the house about fortyfive or fifty year old bareheaded and her spinningstick in her hand and behind her comes her little white children acting the same way the little niggers was doing she was smiling all over so she could hardly standand says its you at lastaint it i out with a yesm before i thought illustration she hugged him tight she grabbed me and hugged me tight and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook and the tears come in her eyes and run down over and she couldnt seem to hug and shake enough and kept saying you dont look as much like your mother as i reckoned you would but law sakes i dont care for that im so glad to see you dear dear it does seem like i could eat you up children its your cousin tomtell him howdy but they ducked their heads and put their fingers in their mouths and hid behind her so she run on lize hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right awayor did you get your breakfast on the boat i said i had got it on the boat so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after when we got there she set me down in a splitbottomed chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says now i can have a good look at you and lawsame ive been hungry for it a many and a many a time all these long years and its come at last we been expecting you a couple of days and more what kep youboat get aground yesmshe dont say yesmsay aunt sally whered she get aground i didnt rightly know what to say because i didnt know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down but i go a good deal on instinct and my instinct said she would be coming upfrom down towards orleans that didnt help me much though for i didnt know the names of bars down that way i see id got to invent a bar or forget the name of the one we got aground onornow i struck an idea and fetched it out it warnt the groundingthat didnt keep us back but a little we blowed out a cylinderhead good gracious anybody hurt nom killed a nigger well its lucky because sometimes people do get hurt two years ago last christmas your uncle silas was coming up from newrleans on the old lally rook and she blowed out a cylinderhead and crippled a man and i think he died afterwards he was a baptist your uncle silas knowed a family in baton rouge that knowed his people very well yes i remember now he did die mortification set in and they had to amputate him but it didnt save him yes it was mortificationthat was it he turned blue all over and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection they say he was a sight to look at your uncles been up to the town every day to fetch you and hes gone again not moren an hour ago hell be back any minute now you must a met him on the road didnt youoldish man with a no i didnt see nobody aunt sally the boat landed just at daylight and i left my baggage on the wharfboat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country to put in the time and not get here too soon and so i come down the back way whod you give the baggage to nobody why child it ll be stole not where i hid it i reckon it wont i says howd you get your breakfast so early on the boat it was kinder thin ice but i says the captain see me standing around and told me i better have something to eat before i went ashore so he took me in the texas to the officers lunch and give me all i wanted i was getting so uneasy i couldnt listen good i had my mind on the children all the time i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little and find out who i was but i couldnt get no show mrs phelps kept it up and run on so pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back because she says but here were arunning on this way and you haint told me a word about sis nor any of them now ill rest my works a little and you start up yourn just tell me everythingtell me all about m all every one of m and how they are and what theyre doing and what they told you to tell me and every last thing you can think of well i see i was up a stumpand up it good providence had stood by me this fur all right but i was hard and tight aground now i see it warnt a bit of use to try to go aheadid got to throw up my hand so i says to myself heres another place where i got to resk the truth i opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here he comes stick your head down lowerthere thatll do you cant be seen now dont you let on youre here ill play a joke on him children dont you say a word i see i was in a fix now but it warnt no use to worry there warnt nothing to do but just hold still and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck i had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in then the bed hid him mrs phelps she jumps for him and says has he come no says her husband goodness gracious she says what in the warld can have become of him i cant imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy uneasy she says im ready to go distracted he must a come and youve missed him along the road i know its sosomething tells me so why sally i couldnt miss him along the roadyou know that but oh dear dear what will sis say he must a come you must a missed him he oh dont distress me any moren im already distressed i dont know what in the world to make of it im at my wits end and i dont mind acknowledging t im right down scared but theres no hope that hes come for he couldnt come and me miss him sally its terriblejust terriblesomethings happened to the boat sure why silas look yonderup the roadaint that somebody coming he sprung to the window at the head of the bed and that give mrs phelps the chance she wanted she stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull and out i come and when he turned back from the window there she stood abeaming and asmiling like a house afire and i standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside the old gentleman stared and says why whos that who do you reckon t is illustration who do you reckon it is i haint no idea who is it its tom sawyer by jings i most slumped through the floor but there warnt no time to swap knives the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook and kept on shaking and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry and then how they both did fire off questions about sid and mary and the rest of the tribe but if they was joyful it warnt nothing to what i was for it was like being born again i was so glad to find out who i was well they froze to me for two hours and at last when my chin was so tired it couldnt hardly go any more i had told them more about my familyi mean the sawyer familythan ever happened to any six sawyer families and i explained all about how we blowed out a cylinderhead at the mouth of white river and it took us three days to fix it which was all right and worked firstrate because they didnt know but what it would take three days to fix it if id a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well now i was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side and pretty uncomfortable all up the other being tom sawyer was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river then i says to myself spose tom sawyer comes down on that boat and spose he steps in here any minute and sings out my name before i can throw him a wink to keep quiet well i couldnt have it that way it wouldnt do at all i must go up the road and waylay him so i told the folks i reckoned i would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage the old gentleman was for going along with me but i said no i could drive the horse myself and i druther he wouldnt take no trouble about me illustration it was tom sawyer chapter xxxiii so i started for town in the wagon and when i was halfway i see a wagon coming and sure enough it was tom sawyer and i stopped and waited till he come along i says hold on and it stopped alongside and his mouth opened up like a trunk and stayed so and he swallowed two or three times like a person thats got a dry throat and then says i haint ever done you no harm you know that so then what you want to come back and hant me for i says i haint come backi haint been gone when he heard my voice it righted him up some but he warnt quite satisfied yet he says dont you play nothing on me because i wouldnt on you honest injun now you aint a ghost honest injun i aint i says welliiwell that ought to settle it of course but i cant somehow seem to understand it no way looky here warnt you ever murdered at all no i warnt ever murdered at alli played it on them you come in here and feel of me if you dont believe me so he done it and it satisfied him and he was that glad to see me again he didnt know what to do and he wanted to know all about it right off because it was a grand adventure and mysterious and so it hit him where he lived but i said leave it alone till by and by and told his driver to wait and we drove off a little piece and i told him the kind of a fix i was in and what did he reckon we better do he said let him alone a minute and dont disturb him so he thought and thought and pretty soon he says its all right ive got it take my trunk in your wagon and let on its yourn and you turn back and fool along slow so as to get to the house about the time you ought to and ill go towards town a piece and take a fresh start and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you and you neednt let on to know me at first i says all right but wait a minute theres one more thinga thing that nobody dont know but me and that is theres a nigger here that im atrying to steal out of slavery and his name is jimold miss watsons jim he says what why jim is he stopped and went to studying i says i know what youll say youll say its dirty lowdown business but what if it is im low down and im agoing to steal him and i want you keep mum and not let on will you his eye lit up and he says ill help you steal him well i let go all holts then like i was shot it was the most astonishing speech i ever heardand im bound to say tom sawyer fell considerable in my estimation only i couldnt believe it tom sawyer a niggerstealer oh shucks i says youre joking i aint joking either well then i says joking or no joking if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger dont forget to remember that you dont know nothing about him and i dont know nothing about him then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon and he drove off his way and i drove mine but of course i forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking so i got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip the old gentleman was at the door and he says why this is wonderful whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it i wish wed a timed her and she haint sweated a hairnot a hair its wonderful why i wouldnt take a hundred dollars for that horse nowi wouldnt honest and yet id a sold her for fifteen before and thought twas all she was worth thats all he said he was the innocentest best old soul i ever see but it warnt surprising because he warnt only just a farmer he was a preacher too and had a little onehorse log church down back of the plantation which he built it himself at his own expense for a church and schoolhouse and never charged nothing for his preaching and it was worth it too there was plenty other farmerpreachers like that and done the same way down south in about half an hour toms wagon drove up to the front stile and aunt sally she see it through the window because it was only about fifty yards and says why theres somebody come i wonder who tis why i do believe its a stranger jimmy thats one of the children run and tell lize to put on another plate for dinner everybody made a rush for the front door because of course a stranger dont come every year and so he lays over the yallerfever for interest when he does come tom was over the stile and starting for the house the wagon was spinning up the road for the village and we was all bunched in the front door tom had his store clothes on and an audienceand that was always nuts for tom sawyer in them circumstances it warnt no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable he warnt a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep no he come cam and important like the ram when he got afront of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didnt want to disturb them and says mr archibald nichols i presume illustration mr archibald nichols i presume no my boy says the old gentleman im sorry to say t your driver has deceived you nicholss place is down a matter of three mile more come in come in tom he took a look back over his shoulder and says too latehes out of sight yes hes gone my son and you must come in and eat your dinner with us and then well hitch up and take you down to nicholss oh i cant make you so much trouble i couldnt think of it ill walki dont mind the distance but we wont let you walkit wouldnt be southern hospitality to do it come right in oh do says aunt sally it aint a bit of trouble to us not a bit in the world you must stay its a long dusty three mile and we cant let you walk and besides ive already told em to put on another plate when i see you coming so you mustnt disappoint us come right in and make yourself at home so tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome and let himself be persuaded and come in and when he was in he said he was a stranger from hicksville ohio and his name was william thompsonand he made another bow well he run on and on and on making up stuff about hicksville and everybody in it he could invent and i getting a little nervious and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape and at last still talking along he reached over and kissed aunt sally right on the mouth and then settled back again in his chair comfortable and was going on talking but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand and says you owdacious puppy he looked kind of hurt and says im surprised at you mam youre srpwhy what do you reckon i am ive a good notion to take andsay what do you mean by kissing me he looked kind of humble and says i didnt mean nothing mam i didnt mean no harm iithought youd like it why you born fool she took up the spinning stick and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it what made you think id like it well i dont know only theytheytold me you would they told you i would whoever told yous another lunatic i never heard the beat of it whos they why everybody they all said so mam it was all she could do to hold in and her eyes snapped and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him and she says whos everybody out with their names or therll be an idiot short he got up and looked distressed and fumbled his hat and says im sorry and i warnt expecting it they told me to they all told me to they all said kiss her and said shed like it they all said itevery one of them but im sorry mam and i wont do it no morei wont honest you wont wont you well i shd reckon you wont nom im honest about it i wont ever do it againtill you ask me till i ask you well i never see the beat of it in my born days i lay youll be the methusalemnumskull of creation before ever i ask youor the likes of you well he says it does surprise me so i cant make it out somehow they said you would and i thought you would but he stopped and looked around slow like he wished he could run across a friendly eye somewheres and fetched up on the old gentlemans and says didnt you think shed like me to kiss her sir why no iiwell no i blieve i didnt then he looks on around the same way to me and says tom didnt you think aunt sally d open out her arms and say sid sawyer my land she says breaking in and jumping for him you impudent young rascal to fool a body so and was going to hug him but he fended her off and says no not till youve asked me first so she didnt lose no time but asked him and hugged him and kissed him over and over again and then turned him over to the old man and he took what was left and after they got a little quiet again she says why dear me i never see such a surprise we warnt looking for you at all but only tom sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him its because it warnt intended for any of us to come but tom he says but i begged and begged and at the last minute she let me come too so coming down the river me and tom thought it would be a first rate surprise for him to come here to the house first and for me to by and by tag along and drop in and let on to be a stranger but it was a mistake aunt sally this aint no healthy place for a stranger to come nonot impudent whelps sid you ought to had your jaws boxed i haint been so put out since i dont know when but i dont care i dont mind the termsid be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here well to think of that performance i dont deny it i was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack illustration a pretty long blessing we had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen and there was things enough on that table for seven familiesand all hot too none of your flabby tough meat thats laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning uncle silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it but it was worth it and it didnt cool it a bit neither the way ive seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times there was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon and me and tom was on the lookout all the time but it warnt no use they didnt happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger and we was afraid to try to work up to it but at supper at night one of the little boys says pa maynt tom and sid and me go to the show no says the old man i reckon there aint going to be any and you couldnt go if there was because the runaway nigger told burton and me all about that scandalous show and burton said he would tell the people so i reckon theyve drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time so there it wasbut i couldnt help it tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed so being tired we bid goodnight and went up to bed right after supper and clumb out of the window and down the lightning rod and shoved for the town for i didnt believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint and so if i didnt hurry up and give them one theyd get into trouble sure on the road tom he told me all about how it was reckoned i was murdered and how pap disappeared pretty soon and didnt come back no more and what a stir there was when jim run away and i told tom all about our royal nonesuch rapscallions and as much of the raft voyage as i had time to and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of itit was as much as halfafter eight thenhere comes a raging rush of people with torches and an awful whooping and yelling and banging tin pans and blowing horns and we jumped to one side to let them go by and as they went by i see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a railthat is i knowed it was the king and the duke though they was all over tar and feathers and didnt look like nothing in the world that was humanjust looked like a couple of monstrous big soldierplumes well it made me sick to see it and i was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals it seemed like i couldnt ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world it was a dreadful thing to see human beings can be awful cruel to one another illustration travelling by rail we see we was too latecouldnt do no good we asked some stragglers about it and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage then somebody give a signal and the house rose up and went for them so we poked along back home and i warnt feeling so brash as i was before but kind of ornery and humble and to blame somehowthough i hadnt done nothing but thats always the way it dont make no difference whether you do right or wrong a persons conscience aint got no sense and just goes for him anyway if i had a yaller dog that didnt know no more than a persons conscience does i would pison him it takes up more room than all the rest of a persons insides and yet aint no good nohow tom sawyer he says the same illustration vittles chapter xxxiv we stopped talking and got to thinking by and by tom says looky here huck what fools we are to not think of it before i bet i know where jim is no where in that hut down by the ashhopper why looky here when we was at dinner didnt you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles yes what did you think the vittles was for for a dog so d i well it wasnt for a dog why because part of it was watermelon so it wasi noticed it well it does beat all that i never thought about a dog not eating watermelon it shows how a body can see and dont see at the same time well the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in and he locked it again when he came out he fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from tablesame key i bet watermelon shows man lock shows prisoner and it aint likely theres two prisoners on such a little plantation and where the peoples all so kind and good jims the prisoner all rightim glad we found it out detective fashion i wouldnt give shucks for any other way now you work your mind and study out a plan to steal jim and i will study out one too and well take the one we like the best what a head for just a boy to have if i had tom sawyers head i wouldnt trade it off to be a duke nor mate of a steamboat nor clown in a circus nor nothing i can think of i went to thinking out a plan but only just to be doing something i knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from pretty soon tom says ready yes i says all rightbring it out my plan is this i says we can easy find out if its jim in there then get up my canoe tomorrow night and fetch my raft over from the island then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old mans britches after he goes to bed and shove off down the river on the raft with jim hiding daytimes and running nights the way me and jim used to do before wouldnt that plan work work why certnly it would work like rats afighting but its too blame simple there aint nothing to it whats the good of a plan that aint no more trouble than that its as mild as goosemilk why huck it wouldnt make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory i never said nothing because i warnt expecting nothing different but i knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldnt have none of them objections to it and it didnt he told me what it was and i see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style and would make jim just as free a man as mine would and maybe get us all killed besides so i was satisfied and said we would waltz in on it i neednt tell what it was here because i knowed it wouldnt stay the way it was i knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance and that is what he done well one thing was dead sure and that was that tom sawyer was in earnest and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery that was the thing that was too many for me here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up and had a character to lose and folks at home that had characters and he was bright and not leatherheaded and knowing and not ignorant and not mean but kind and yet here he was without any more pride or rightness or feeling than to stoop to this business and make himself a shame and his family a shame before everybody i couldnt understand it no way at all it was outrageous and i knowed i ought to just up and tell him so and so be his true friend and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself and i did start to tell him but he shut me up and says dont you reckon i know what im about dont i generly know what im about yes didnt i say i was going to help steal the nigger yes well then thats all he said and thats all i said it warnt no use to say any more because when he said hed do a thing he always done it but i couldnt make out how he was willing to go into this thing so i just let it go and never bothered no more about it if he was bound to have it so i couldnt help it when we got home the house was all dark and still so we went on down to the hut by the ashhopper for to examine it we went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do they knowed us and didnt make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night when we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides and on the side i warnt acquainted withwhich was the north sidewe found a square windowhole up tolerable high with just one stout board nailed across it i says heres the ticket this holes big enough for jim to get through if we wrench off the board tom says its as simple as tittattoe threeinarow and as easy as playing hooky i should hope we can find a way thats a little more complicated than that huck finn illustration a simple job well then i says how ll it do to saw him out the way i done before i was murdered that time thats more like he says its real mysterious and troublesome and good he says but i bet we can find a way thats twice as long there aint no hurry les keep on looking around betwixt the hut and the fence on the back side was a leanto that joined the hut at the eaves and was made out of plank it was as long as the hut but narrowonly about six foot wide the door to it was at the south end and was padlocked tom he went to the soapkettle and searched around and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with so he took it and prized out one of the staples the chain fell down and we opened the door and went in and shut it and struck a match and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadnt no connection with it and there warnt no floor to the shed nor nothing in it but some old rusty playedout hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow the match went out and so did we and shoved in the staple again and the door was locked as good as ever tom was joyful he says now were all right well dig him out it ll take about a week then we started for the house and i went in the back dooryou only have to pull a buckskin latchstring they dont fasten the doorsbut that warnt romantical enough for tom sawyer no way would do him but he must climb up the lightningrod but after he got up half way about three times and missed fire and fell every time and the last time most busted his brains out he thought hed got to give it up but after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck and this time he made the trip in the morning we was up at break of day and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed jimif it was jim that was being fed the niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields and jims nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things and whilst the others was leaving the key come from the house this nigger had a goodnatured chuckleheaded face and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread that was to keep witches off he said the witches was pestering him awful these nights and making him see all kinds of strange things and hear all kinds of strange words and noises and he didnt believe he was ever witched so long before in his life he got so worked up and got to running on so about his troubles he forgot all about what hed been agoing to do so tom says whats the vittles for going to feed the dogs the nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face like when you heave a brickbat in a mudpuddle and he says yes mars sid a dog curus dog too does you want to go en look at im yes i hunched tom and whispers you going right here in the daybreak that warnt the plan no it warnt but its the plan now so drat him we went along but i didnt like it much when we got in we couldnt hardly see anything it was so dark but jim was there sure enough and could see us and he sings out why huck en good lan ain dat misto tom i just knowed how it would be i just expected it i didnt know nothing to do and if i had i couldnt a done it because that nigger busted in and says why de gracious sakes do he know you genlmen we could see pretty well now tom he looked at the nigger steady and kind of wondering and says does who know us why disyer runaway nigger i dont reckon he does but what put that into your head what put it dar didn he jis dis minute sing out like he knowed you tom says in a puzzledup kind of way well thats mighty curious who sung out when did he sing out what did he sing out and turns to me perfectly cam and says did you hear anybody sing out of course there warnt nothing to be said but the one thing so i says no i aint heard nobody say nothing then he turns to jim and looks him over like he never see him before and says did you sing out no sah says jim i haint said nothing sah not a word no sah i haint said a word did you ever see us before no sah not as i knows on so tom turns to the nigger which was looking wild and distressed and says kind of severe what do you reckons the matter with you anyway what made you think somebody sung out oh its de dadblame witches sah en i wisht i was dead i do deys awluz at it sah en dey do mos kill me dey skyers me so please to dont tell nobody bout it sah er ole mars silas hell scole me kase he say dey aint no witches i jis wish to goodness he was heah nowden what would he say i jis bet he couldn fine no way to git aroun it dis time but its awluz jis so people dats sot stays sot dey wont look into nothnen fine it out fr deyselves en when you fine it out en tell um bout it dey doan blieve you illustration witches tom give him a dime and said we wouldnt tell nobody and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with and then looks at jim and says i wonder if uncle silas is going to hang this nigger if i was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away i wouldnt give him up id hang him and whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good he whispers to jim and says dont ever let on to know us and if you hear any digging going on nights its us were going to set you free jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it then the nigger come back and we said wed come again some time if the nigger wanted us to and he said he would more particular if it was dark because the witches went for him mostly in the dark and it was good to have folks around then illustration getting wood chapter xxxv it would be most an hour yet till breakfast so we left and struck down into the woods because tom said we got to have some light to see how to dig by and a lantern makes too much and might get us into trouble what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks thats called fox fire and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place we fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds and set down to rest and tom says kind of dissatisfied blame it this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be and so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan there aint no watchman to be druggednow there ought to be a watchman there aint even a dog to give a sleepingmixture to and theres jim chained by one leg with a tenfoot chain to the leg of his bed why all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain and uncle silas he trusts everybody sends the key to the punkinheaded nigger and dont send nobody to watch the nigger jim could a got out of that windowhole before this only there wouldnt be no use trying to travel with a tenfoot chain on his leg why drat it huck its the stupidest arrangement i ever see you got to invent all the difficulties well we cant help it we got to do the best we can with the materials weve got anyhow theres one thingtheres more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers where there warnt one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them and you had to contrive them all out of your own head now look at just that one thing of the lantern when you come down to the cold facts we simply got to let on that a lanterns resky why we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to i believe now whilst i think of it we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get what do we want of a saw what do we want of it haint we got to saw the leg of jims bed off so as to get the chain loose why you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off well if that aint just like you huck finn you can get up the infantschooliest ways of going at a thing why haint you ever read any books at allbaron trenck nor casanova nor benvenuto chelleeny nor henri iv nor none of them heroes who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an oldmaidy way as that no the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bedleg in two and leave it just so and swallow the sawdust so it cant be found and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal cant see no sign of its being sawed and thinks the bedleg is perfectly sound then the night youre ready fetch the leg a kick down she goes slip off your chain and there you are nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements shin down it break your leg in the moatbecause a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short you knowand theres your horses and your trusty vassles and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle and away you go to your native langudoc or navarre or wherever it is its gaudy huck i wish there was a moat to this cabin if we get time the night of the escape well dig one i says what do we want of a moat when were going to snake him out from under the cabin but he never heard me he had forgot me and everything else he had his chin in his hand thinking pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head then sighs again and says no it wouldnt dothere aint necessity enough for it for what i says why to saw jims leg off he says good land i says why there aint no necessity for it and what would you want to saw his leg off for anyway illustration one of the best authorities well some of the best authorities has done it they couldnt get the chain off so they just cut their hand off and shoved and a leg would be better still but we got to let that go there aint necessity enough in this case and besides jims a nigger and wouldnt understand the reasons for it and how its the custom in europe so well let it go but theres one thinghe can have a rope ladder we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough and we can send it to him in a pie its mostly done that way and ive et worse pies why tom sawyer how you talk i says jim aint got no use for a rope ladder he has got use for it how you talk you better say you dont know nothing about it hes got to have a rope ladder they all do what in the nation can he do with it do with it he can hide it in his bed cant he thats what they all do and hes got to too huck you dont ever seem to want to do anything thats regular you want to be starting something fresh all the time spose he dont do nothing with it aint it there in his bed for a clew after hes gone and dont you reckon theyll want clews of course they will and you wouldnt leave them any that would be a pretty howdydo wouldnt it i never heard of such a thing well i says if its in the regulations and hes got to have it all right let him have it because i dont wish to go back on no regulations but theres one thing tom sawyerif we go to tearing up our sheets to make jim a rope ladder were going to get into trouble with aunt sally just as sure as youre born now the way i look at it a hickrybark ladder dont cost nothing and dont waste nothing and is just as good to load up a pie with and hide in a straw tick as any rag ladder you can start and as for jim he aint had no experience and so he dont care what kind of a oh shucks huck finn if i was as ignorant as you id keep stillthats what id do who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickrybark ladder why its perfectly ridiculous well all right tom fix it your own way but if youll take my advice youll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline he said that would do and that gave him another idea and he says borrow a shirt too what do we want of a shirt tom want it for jim to keep a journal on journal your grannyjim cant write spose he cant writehe can make marks on the shirt cant he if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrelhoop why tom we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one and quicker too prisoners dont have geese running around the donjonkeep to pull pens out of you muggins they always make their pens out of the hardest toughest troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out too because theyve got to do it by rubbing it on the wall they wouldnt use a goosequill if they had it it aint regular well then whatll we make him the ink out of many makes it out of ironrust and tears but thats the common sort and women the best authorities uses their own blood jim can do that and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where hes captivated he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window the iron mask always done that and its a blame good way too jim aint got no tin plates they feed him in a pan that aint nothing we can get him some cant nobody read his plates that aint got anything to do with it huck finn all hes got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out you dont have to be able to read it why half the time you cant read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate or anywhere else well then whats the sense in wasting the plates why blame it all it aint the prisoners plates but its somebodys plates aint it well sposn it is what does the prisoner care whose he broke off there because we heard the breakfasthorn blowing so we cleared out for the house illustration the breakfasthorn along during the morning i borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothesline and i found an old sack and put them in it and we went down and got the foxfire and put that in too i called it borrowing because that was what pap always called it but tom said it warnt borrowing it was stealing he said we was representing prisoners and prisoners dont care how they get a thing so they get it and nobody dont blame them for it either it aint no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with tom said its his right and so as long as we was representing a prisoner we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with he said if we warnt prisoners it would be a very different thing and nobody but a mean ornery person would steal when he warnt a prisoner so we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy and yet he made a mighty fuss one day after that when i stole a watermelon out of the niggerpatch and eat it and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for tom said that what he meant was we could steal anything we needed well i says i needed the watermelon but he said i didnt need it to get out of prison with theres where the difference was he said if id a wanted it to hide a knife in and smuggle it to jim to kill the seneskal with it would a been all right so i let it go at that though i couldnt see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if i got to set down and chaw over a lot of goldleaf distinctions like that every time i see a chance to hog a watermelon well as i was saying we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business and nobody in sight around the yard then tom he carried the sack into the leanto whilst i stood off a piece to keep watch by and by he come out and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk he says everythings all right now except tools and thats easy fixed tools i says yes tools for what why to dig with we aint agoing to gnaw him out are we aint them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with i says he turns on me looking pitying enough to make a body cry and says huck finn did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with now i want to ask youif you got any reasonableness in you at allwhat kind of a show would that give him to be a hero why they might as well lend him the key and done with it picks and shovelswhy they wouldnt furnish em to a king well then i says if we dont want the picks and shovels what do we want a couple of caseknives to dig the foundations out from under that cabin with yes confound it its foolish tom it dont make no difference how foolish it is its the right wayand its the regular way and there aint no other way that ever i heard of and ive read all the books that gives any information about these things they always dig out with a caseknifeand not through dirt mind you generly its through solid rock and it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks and for ever and ever why look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the castle deef in the harbor of marseilles that dug himself out that way how long was he at it you reckon i dont know well guess i dont know a month and a half thirtyseven yearand he come out in china thats the kind i wish the bottom of this fortress was solid rock jim dont know nobody in china whats that got to do with it neither did that other fellow but youre always awandering off on a side issue why cant you stick to the main point all righti dont care where he comes out so he comes out and jim dont either i reckon but theres one thing anywayjims too old to be dug out with a caseknife he wont last yes he will last too you dont reckon its going to take thirty seven years to dig out through a dirt foundation do you how long will it take tom well we cant resk being as long as we ought to because it maynt take very long for uncle silas to hear from down there by new orleans hell hear jim aint from there then his next move will be to advertise jim or something like that so we cant resk being as long digging him out as we ought to by rights i reckon we ought to be a couple of years but we cant things being so uncertain what i recommend is this that we really dig right in as quick as we can and after that we can let on to ourselves that we was at it thirtyseven years then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time theres an alarm yes i reckon that ll be the best way now theres sense in that i says letting on dont cost nothing letting on aint no trouble and if its any object i dont mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year it wouldnt strain me none after i got my hand in so ill mosey along now and smouch a couple of caseknives illustration smouching the knives smouch three he says we want one to make a saw out of tom if it aint unregular and irreligious to sejest it i says theres an old rusty sawblade around yonder sticking under the weatherboarding behind the smokehouse he looked kind of weary and discouragedlike and says it aint no use to try to learn you nothing huck run along and smouch the knivesthree of them so i done it illustration going down the lightningrod chapter xxxvi as soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightningrod and shut ourselves up in the leanto and got out our pile of foxfire and went to work we cleared everything out of the way about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log tom said he was right behind jims bed now and wed dig in under it and when we got through there couldnt nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there because jims counterpin hung down most to the ground and youd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole so we dug and dug with the caseknives till most midnight and then we was dogtired and our hands was blistered and yet you couldnt see wed done anything hardly at last i says this aint no thirtyseven year job this is a thirtyeight year job tom sawyer he never said nothing but he sighed and pretty soon he stopped digging and then for a good little while i knowed that he was thinking then he says it aint no use huck it aint agoing to work if we was prisoners it would because then wed have as many years as we wanted and no hurry and we wouldnt get but a few minutes to dig every day while they was changing watches and so our hands wouldnt get blistered and we could keep it up right along year in and year out and do it right and the way it ought to be done but we cant fool along we got to rush we aint got no time to spare if we was to put in another night this way wed have to knock off for a week to let our hands get wellcouldnt touch a caseknife with them sooner well then what we going to do tom ill tell you it aint right and it aint moral and i wouldnt like it to get out but there aint only just the one way we got to dig him out with the picks and let on its caseknives now youre talking i says your head gets leveler and leveler all the time tom sawyer i says picks is the thing moral or no moral and as for me i dont care shucks for the morality of it nohow when i start in to steal a nigger or a watermelon or a sundayschool book i aint no ways particular how its done so its done what i want is my nigger or what i want is my watermelon or what i want is my sunday school book and if a picks the handiest thing thats the thing im a going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that sundayschool book out with and i dont give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther well he says theres excuse for picks and lettingon in a case like this if it warnt so i wouldnt approve of it nor i wouldnt stand by and see the rules brokebecause right is right and wrong is wrong and a body aint got no business doing wrong when he aint ignorant and knows better it might answer for you to dig jim out with a pick without any letting on because you dont know no better but it wouldnt for me because i do know better gimme a caseknife he had his own by him but i handed him mine he flung it down and says gimme a caseknife i didnt know just what to dobut then i thought i scratched around amongst the old tools and got a pickaxe and give it to him and he took it and went to work and never said a word he was always just that particular full of principle so then i got a shovel and then we picked and shoveled turn about and made the fur fly we stuck to it about a half an hour which was as long as we could stand up but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it when i got up stairs i looked out at the window and see tom doing his level best with the lightningrod but he couldnt come it his hands was so sore at last he says it aint no use it cant be done what you reckon i better do cant you think of no way yes i says but i reckon it aint regular come up the stairs and let on its a lightningrod so he done it illustration stealing spoons next day tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house for to make some pens for jim out of and six tallow candles and i hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance and stole three tin plates tom says it wasnt enough but i said nobody wouldnt ever see the plates that jim throwed out because theyd fall in the dogfennel and jimpson weeds under the windowholethen we could tote them back and he could use them over again so tom was satisfied then he says now the thing to study out is how to get the things to jim take them in through the hole i says when we get it done he only just looked scornful and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea and then he went to studying by and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways but there warnt no need to decide on any of them yet said wed got to post jim first that night we went down the lightningrod a little after ten and took one of the candles along and listened under the windowhole and heard jim snoring so we pitched it in and it didnt wake him then we whirled in with the pick and shovel and in about two hours and a half the job was done we crept in under jims bed and into the cabin and pawed around and found the candle and lit it and stood over jim awhile and found him looking hearty and healthy and then we woke him up gentle and gradual he was so glad to see us he most cried and called us honey and all the pet names he could think of and was for having us hunt up a coldchisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away and clearing out without losing any time but tom he showed him how unregular it would be and set down and told him all about our plans and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm and not to be the least afraid because we would see he got away sure so jim he said it was all right and we set there and talked over old times awhile and then tom asked a lot of questions and when jim told him uncle silas come in every day or two to pray with him and aunt sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat and both of them was kind as they could be tom says now i know how to fix it well send you some things by them i said dont do nothing of the kind its one of the most jackass ideas i ever struck but he never paid no attention to me went right on it was his way when hed got his plans set so he told jim how wed have to smuggle in the ropeladder pie and other large things by nat the nigger that fed him and he must be on the lookout and not be surprised and not let nat see him open them and we would put small things in uncles coatpockets and he must steal them out and we would tie things to aunts apronstrings or put them in her apronpocket if we got a chance and told him what they would be and what they was for and told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood and all that he told him everything jim he couldnt see no sense in the most of it but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him so he was satisfied and said he would do it all just as tom said jim had plenty corncob pipes and tobacco so we had a right down good sociable time then we crawled out through the hole and so home to bed with hands that looked like theyd been chawed tom was in high spirits he said it was the best fun he ever had in his life and the most intellectural and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave jim to our children to get out for he believed jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it he said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year and would be the best time on record and he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it in the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes and tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket then we went to the nigger cabins and while i got nats notice off tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn pone that was in jims pan and we went along with nat to see how it would work and it just worked noble when jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out and there warnt ever anything could a worked better tom said so himself jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that thats always getting into bread you know but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first and whilst we was astanding there in the dimmish light here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under jims bed and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them and there warnt hardly room in there to get your breath by jings we forgot to fasten that leanto door the nigger nat he only just hollered witches once and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs and begun to groan like he was dying tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of jims meat and the dogs went for it and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door and i knowed hed fixed the other door too then he went to work on the nigger coaxing him and petting him and asking him if hed been imagining he saw something again he raised up and blinked his eyes around and says mars sid youll say is a fool but if i didnt blieve i see most a million dogs er devils er somen i wisht i may die right heah in dese tracks i did mos sholy mars sid i felt umi felt um sah dey was all over me dad fetch it i jis wisht i could git my hans on one er dem witches jis wunstony jis wunstits all id ast but mosly i wisht deyd lemme lone i does tom says well i tell you what i think what makes them come here just at this runaway niggers breakfasttime its because theyre hungry thats the reason you make them a witch pie thats the thing for you to do illustration tom advises a witch pie but my lan mars sid hows i

atalkin bout i wouldn lay de weight er my finger on um not fr ten hundd thousn billion dollars i wouldnt illustration the rubbagepile chapter xxxvii that was all fixed so then we went away and went to the rubbagepile in the back yard where they keep the old boots and rags and pieces of bottles and woreout tin things and all such truck and scratched around and found an old tin washpan and stopped up the holes as well as we could to bake the pie in and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast and found a couple of shinglenails that tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with and dropped one of them in aunt sallys apronpocket which was hanging on a chair and tother we stuck in the band of uncle silass hat which was on the bureau because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway niggers house this morning and then went to breakfast and tom dropped the pewter spoon in uncle silass coatpocket and aunt sally wasnt come yet so we had to wait a little while and when she come she was hot and red and cross and couldnt hardly wait for the blessing and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest childs head with her thimble with the other and says ive hunted high and ive hunted low and it does beat all what has become of your other shirt my heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things and a hard piece of corncrust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough and was shot across the table and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a fishingworm and let a cry out of him the size of a warwhoop and tom he turned kinder blue around the gills and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that and i would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder but after that we was all right againit was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold uncle silas he says its most uncommon curious i cant understand it i know perfectly well i took it off because because you haint got but one on just listen at the man i know you took it off and know it by a better way than your woolgethering memory too because it was on the closline yesterdayi see it there myself but its gone thats the long and the short of it and youll just have to change to a red flannl one till i can get time to make a new one and it ll be the third ive made in two years it just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts and whatever you do manage to do with m all is moren i can make out a body d think you would learn to take some sort of care of em at your time of life i know it sally and i do try all i can but it oughtnt to be altogether my fault because you know i dont see them nor have nothing to do with them except when theyre on me and i dont believe ive ever lost one of them off of me well it aint your fault if you havent silas youd a done it if you could i reckon and the shirt aint all thats gone nuther thers a spoon gone and that aint all there was ten and now thers only nine the calf got the shirt i reckon but the calf never took the spoon thats certain why what else is gone sally thers six candles gonethats what the rats could a got the candles and i reckon they did i wonder they dont walk off with the whole place the way youre always going to stop their holes and dont do it and if they warnt fools theyd sleep in your hair silasyoud never find it out but you cant lay the spoon on the rats and that i know well sally im in fault and i acknowledge it ive been remiss but i wont let tomorrow go by without stopping up them holes oh i wouldnt hurry next year ll do matilda angelina araminta phelps whack comes the thimble and the child snatches her claws out of the sugarbowl without fooling around any just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage and says missus deys a sheet gone illustration missus deys a sheet gone a sheet gone well for the lands sake ill stop up them holes today says uncle silas looking sorrowful oh do shet upspose the rats took the sheet wheres it gone lize clah to goodness i haint no notion miss sally she wuz on de closline yistiddy but she done gone she ain dah no mo now i reckon the world is coming to an end i never see the beat of it in all my born days a shirt and a sheet and a spoon and six can missus comes a young yaller wench deys a brass cannelstick missn cler out from here you hussy er ill take a skillet to ye well she was just abiling i begun to lay for a chance i reckoned i would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated she kept araging right along running her insurrection all by herself and everybody else mighty meek and quiet and at last uncle silas looking kind of foolish fishes up that spoon out of his pocket she stopped with her mouth open and her hands up and as for me i wished i was in jeruslem or somewheres but not long because she says its just as i expected so you had it in your pocket all the time and like as not youve got the other things there too howd it get there i reely dont know sally he says kind of apologizing or you know i would tell i was astudying over my text in acts seventeen before breakfast and i reckon i put it in there not noticing meaning to put my testament in and it must be so because my testament aint in but ill go and see and if the testament is where i had it ill know i didnt put it in and that will show that i laid the testament down and took up the spoon and oh for the lands sake give a body a rest go long now the whole kit and biling of ye and dont come nigh me again till ive got back my peace of mind id a heard her if shed a said it to herself let alone speaking it out and id a got up and obeyed her if id a been dead as we was passing through the settingroom the old man he took up his hat and the shingle nail fell out on the floor and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantelshelf and never said nothing and went out tom see him do it and remembered about the spoon and says well it aint no use to send things by him no more he aint reliable then he says but he done us a good turn with the spoon anyway without knowing it and so well go and do him one without him knowing itstop up his ratholes there was a noble good lot of them down cellar and it took us a whole hour but we done the job tight and good and shipshape then we heard steps on the stairs and blowed out our light and hid and here comes the old man with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in tother looking as absentminded as year before last he went a mooning around first to one rathole and then another till hed been to them all then he stood about five minutes picking tallowdrip off of his candle and thinking then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs saying well for the life of me i cant remember when i done it i could show her now that i warnt to blame on account of the rats but never mindlet it go i reckon it wouldnt do no good and so he went on amumbling up stairs and then we left he was a mighty nice old man and always is tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon but he said wed got to have it so he took a think when he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do then we went and waited around the spoon basket till we see aunt sally coming and then tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side and i slid one of them up my sleeve and tom says why aunt sally there aint but nine spoons yet she says go long to your play and dont bother me i know better i counted m myself well ive counted them twice aunty and i cant make but nine she looked out of all patience but of course she come to countanybody would i declare to gracious ther aint but nine she says why what in the worldplague take the things ill count m again so i slipped back the one i had and when she got done counting she says hang the troublesome rubbage thers ten now and she looked huffy and bothered both but tom says why aunty i dont think theres ten you numskull didnt you see me count m i know but well ill count m again illustration in a tearing way so i smouched one and they come out nine same as the other time well she was in a tearing wayjust atrembling all over she was so mad but she counted and counted till she got that addled shed start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes and so three times they come out right and three times they come out wrong then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galleywest and she said cler out and let her have some peace and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner shed skin us so we had the odd spoon and dropped it in her apronpocket whilst she was a giving us our sailing orders and jim got it all right along with her shingle nail before noon we was very well satisfied with this business and tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took because he said now she couldnt ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life and wouldnt believe shed counted them right if she did and said that after shed about counted her head off for the next three days he judged shed give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more so we put the sheet back on the line that night and stole one out of her closet and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till she didnt know how many sheets she had any more and she didnt care and warnt agoing to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it and wouldnt count them again not to save her life she druther die first so we was all right now as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixedup counting and as to the candlestick it warnt no consequence it would blow over by and by but that pie was a job we had no end of trouble with that pie we fixed it up away down in the woods and cooked it there and we got it done at last and very satisfactory too but not all in one day and we had to use up three washpans full of flour before we got through and we got burnt pretty much all over in places and eyes put out with the smoke because you see we didnt want nothing but a crust and we couldnt prop it up right and she would always cave in but of course we thought of the right way at lastwhich was to cook the ladder too in the pie so then we laid in with jim the second night and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with we let on it took nine months to make it and in the forenoon we took it down to the woods but it wouldnt go into the pie being made of a whole sheet that way there was rope enough for forty pies if wed a wanted them and plenty left over for soup or sausage or anything you choose we could a had a whole dinner illustration one of his ancesters but we didnt need it all we needed was just enough for the pie and so we throwed the rest away we didnt cook none of the pies in the wash panafraid the solder would melt but uncle silas he had a noble brass warmingpan which he thought considerable of because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from england with william the conqueror in the mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable not on account of being any account because they warnt but on account of them being relicts you know and we snaked her out private and took her down there but she failed on the first pies because we didnt know how but she come up smiling on the last one we took and lined her with dough and set her in the coals and loaded her up with rag rope and put on a dough roof and shut down the lid and put hot embers on top and stood off five foot with the long handle cool and comfortable and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at but the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along for if that rope ladder wouldnt cramp him down to business i dont know nothing what im talking about and lay him in enough stomachache to last him till next time too nat didnt look when we put the witch pie in jims pan and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles and so jim got everything all right and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window hole illustration jims coat of arms chapter xxxviii making them pens was a distressid tough job and so was the saw and jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all thats the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall but he had to have it tom said hed got to there warnt no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind and his coat of arms look at lady jane grey he says look at gilford dudley look at old northumberland why huck spose it is considerble troublewhat you going to dohow you going to get around it jims got to do his inscription and coat of arms they all do jim says why mars tom i haint got no coat o arm i haint got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt en you knows i got to keep de journal on dat oh you dont understand jim a coat of arms is very different well i says jims right anyway when he says he aint got no coat of arms because he haint i reckon i knowed that tom says but you bet hell have one before he goes out of thisbecause hes going out right and there aint going to be no flaws in his record so whilst me and jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece jim a making hisn out of the brass and i making mine out of the spoon tom set to work to think out the coat of arms by and by he said hed struck so many good ones he didnt hardly know which to take but there was one which he reckoned hed decide on he says on the scutcheon well have a bend or in the dexter base a saltire murrey in the fess with a dog couchant for common charge and under his foot a chain embattled for slavery with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed and three invected lines on a field azure with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented crest a runaway nigger sable with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister and a couple of gules for supporters which is you and me motto maggiore fretta minore otto got it out of a bookmeans the more haste the less speed geewhillikins i says but what does the rest of it mean we aint got no time to bother over that he says we got to dig in like all gitout well anyway i says whats some of it whats a fess a fessa fess isyou dont need to know what a fess is ill show him how to make it when he gets to it shucks tom i says i think you might tell a person whats a bar sinister oh i dont know but hes got to have it all the nobility does that was just his way if it didnt suit him to explain a thing to you he wouldnt do it you might pump at him a week it wouldnt make no difference hed got all that coat of arms business fixed so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work which was to plan out a mournful inscriptionsaid jim got to have one like they all done he made up a lot and wrote them out on a paper and read them off so 1 here a captive heart busted 2 here a poor prisoner forsook by the world and friends fretted his sorrowful life 3 here a lonely heart broke and a worn spirit went to its rest after thirtyseven years of solitary captivity 4 here homeless and friendless after thirtyseven years of bitter captivity perished a noble stranger natural son of louis xiv toms voice trembled whilst he was reading them and he most broke down when he got done he couldnt no way make up his mind which one for jim to scrabble on to the wall they was all so good but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail and he didnt know how to make letters besides but tom said he would block them out for him and then he wouldnt have nothing to do but just follow the lines then pretty soon he says come to think the logs aint agoing to do they dont have log walls in a dungeon we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock well fetch a rock jim said the rock was worse than the logs he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldnt ever get out but tom said he would let me help him do it then he took a look to see how me and jim was getting along with the pens it was most pesky tedious hard work and slow and didnt give my hands no show to get well of the sores and we didnt seem to make no headway hardly so tom says i know how to fix it we got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions and we can kill two birds with that same rock theres a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill and well smouch it and carve the things on it and file out the pens and the saw on it too illustration a tough job it warnt no slouch of an idea and it warnt no slouch of a grindstone nuther but we allowed wed tackle it it warnt quite midnight yet so we cleared out for the mill leaving jim at work we smouched the grindstone and set out to roll her home but it was a most nation tough job sometimes do what we could we couldnt keep her from falling over and she come mighty near mashing us every time tom said she was going to get one of us sure before we got through we got her half way and then we was plumb played out and most drownded with sweat we see it warnt no use we got to go and fetch jim so he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bedleg and wrapt it round and round his neck and we crawled out through our hole and down there and jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing and tom superintended he could outsuperintend any boy i ever see he knowed how to do everything our hole was pretty big but it warnt big enough to get the grindstone through but jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough then tom marked out them things on it with the nail and set jim to work on them with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean to for a hammer and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him and then he could go to bed and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it then we helped him fix his chain back on the bedleg and was ready for bed ourselves but tom thought of something and says you got any spiders in here jim no sah thanks to goodness i haint mars tom all right well get you some but bless you honey i doan want none is afeard un um i jis s soon have rattlesnakes aroun tom thought a minute or two and says its a good idea and i reckon its been done it must a been done

tom she sholy will kase i doan skasely ever cry so tom was stumped but he studied it over and then said jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion he promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one private in jims coffee pot in the morning jim said he would jis s soon have tobacker in his coffee and found so much fault with it and with the work and bother of raising the mullen and jewsharping the rats and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things on top of all the other work he had to do on pens and inscriptions and journals and things which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook that tom most lost all patience with him and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself and yet he didnt know enough to appreciate them and they was just about wasted on him so jim he was sorry and said he wouldnt behave so no more and then me and tom shoved for bed illustration keeping off dull times chapter xxxix in the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rattrap and fetched it down and unstopped the best rathole and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones and then we took it and put it in a safe place under aunt sallys bed but while we was gone for spiders little thomas franklin benjamin jefferson elexander phelps found it there and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out and they did and aunt sally she come in and when we got back she was astanding on top of the bed raising cain and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her so she took and dusted us both with the hickry and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen drat that meddlesome cub and they warnt the likeliest nuther because the first haul was the pick of the flock i never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was we got a splendid stock of sorted spiders and bugs and frogs and caterpillars and one thing or another and we like to got a hornets nest but we didnt the family was at home we didnt give it right up but stayed with them as long as we could because we allowed wed tire them out or theyd got to tire us out and they done it then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places and was pretty near all right again but couldnt set down convenient and so we went for the snakes and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and housesnakes and put them in a bag and put it in our room and by that time it was suppertime and a rattling good honest days work and hungryoh no i reckon not and there warnt a blessed snake up there when we went backwe didnt half tie the sack and they worked out somehow and left but it didnt matter much because they was still on the premises somewheres so we judged we could get some of them again no there warnt no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell youd see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then and they generly landed in your plate or down the back of your neck and most of the time where you didnt want them well they was handsome and striped and there warnt no harm in a million of them but that never made no difference to aunt sally she despised snakes be the breed what they might and she couldnt stand them no way you could fix it and every time one of them flopped down on her it didnt make no difference what she was doing she would just lay that work down and light out i never see such a woman and you could hear her whoop to jericho you couldnt get her to take aholt of one of them with the tongs and if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire she disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadnt ever been no snakes created why after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week aunt sally warnt over it yet she warnt near over it when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings it was very curious but tom said all women was just so he said they was made that way for some reason or other we got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way and she allowed these lickings warnt nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them i didnt mind the lickings because they didnt amount to nothing but i minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot but we got them laid in and all the other things and you never see a cabin as blithesome as jims was when theyd all swarm out for music and go for him jim didnt like the spiders and the spiders didnt like jim and so theyd lay for him and make it mighty warm for him and he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warnt no room in bed for him skasely and when there was a body couldnt sleep it was so lively and it was always lively he said because they never all slept at one time but took turn about so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch so he always had one gang under him in his way and tother gang having a circus over him and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over he said if he ever got out this time he wouldnt ever be a prisoner again not for a salary well by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape the shirt was sent in early in a pie and every time a rat bit jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh the pens was made the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone the bedleg was sawed in two and we had et up the sawdust and it give us a most amazing stomachache we reckoned we was all going to die but didnt it was the most undigestible sawdust i ever see and tom said the same but as i was saying wed got all the work done now at last and we was all pretty much fagged out too but mainly jim the old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below orleans to come and get their runaway nigger but hadnt got no answer because there warnt no such plantation so he allowed he would advertise jim in the st louis and new orleans papers and when he mentioned the st louis ones it give me the cold shivers and i see we hadnt no time to lose so tom said now for the nonnamous letters whats them i says warnings to the people that something is up sometimes its done one way sometimes another but theres always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle when louis xvi was going to light out of the tooleries a servantgirl done it its a very good way and so is the nonnamous letters well use them both and its usual for the prisoners mother to change clothes with him and she stays in and he slides out in her clothes well do that too but looky here tom what do we want to warn anybody for that somethings up let them find it out for themselvesits their lookout yes i know but you cant depend on them its the way theyve acted from the very startleft us to do everything theyre so confiding and mulletheaded they dont take notice of nothing at all so if we dont give them notice there wont be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape ll go off perfectly flat wont amount to nothingwont be nothing to it well as for me tom thats the way id like shucks he says and looked disgusted so i says but i aint going to make no complaint any way that suits you suits me what you going to do about the servantgirl youll be her you slide in in the middle of the night and hook that yaller girls frock why tom that ll make trouble next morning because of course she probbly haint got any but that one i know but you dont want it but fifteen minutes to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door all right then ill do it but i could carry it just as handy in my own togs you wouldnt look like a servantgirl then would you no but there wont be nobody to see what i look like anyway that aint got nothing to do with it the thing for us to do is just to do our duty and not worry about whether anybody sees us do it or not haint you got no principle at all all right i aint saying nothing im the servantgirl whos jims mother im his mother ill hook a gown from aunt sally well then youll have to stay in the cabin when me and jim leaves not much ill stuff jims clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise and jim ll take the nigger womans gown off of me and wear it and well all evade together when a prisoner of style escapes its called an evasion its always called so when a king escapes frinstance and the same with a kings son it dont make no difference whether hes a natural one or an unnatural one so tom he wrote the nonnamous letter and i smouched the yaller wenchs frock that night and put it on and shoved it under the front door the way tom told me to it said beware trouble is brewing keep a sharp lookout unknown friend illustration trouble is brewing next night we stuck a picture which tom drawed in blood of a skull and crossbones on the front door and next night another one of a coffin on the back door i never see a family in such a sweat they couldnt a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air if a door banged aunt sally she jumped and said ouch if anything fell she jumped and said ouch if you happened to touch her when she warnt noticing she done the same she couldnt face noway and be satisfied because she allowed there was something behind her every timeso she was always awhirling around sudden and saying ouch and before shed got twothirds around shed whirl back again and say it again and she was afraid to go to bed but she dasnt set up so the thing was working very well tom said he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory he said it showed it was done right so he said now for the grand bulge so the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready and was wondering what we better do with it because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night tom he went down the lightningrod to spy around and the nigger at the back door was asleep and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back this letter said dont betray me i wish to be your friend there is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the indian territory going to steal your runaway nigger tonight and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them i am one of the gang but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again and will betray the helish design they will sneak down from northards along the fence at midnight exact with a false key and go in the niggers cabin to get him i am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if i see any danger but stead of that i will ba like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all then whilst they are getting his chains loose you slip there and lock them in and can kill them at your leasure dont do anything but just the way i am telling you if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoopjamboreehoo i do not wish any reward but to know i have done the right thing unknown friend illustration fishing chapter xl we was feeling pretty good after breakfast and took my canoe and went over the river afishing with a lunch and had a good time and took a look at the raft and found her all right and got home late to supper and found them in such a sweat and worry they didnt know which end they was standing on and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper and wouldnt tell us what the trouble was and never let on a word about the new letter but didnt need to because we knowed as much about it as anybody did and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed and got up about half past eleven and tom put on aunt sallys dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch but says wheres the butter i laid out a hunk of it i says on a piece of a cornpone well you left it laid out thenit aint here we can get along without it i says we can get along with it too he says just you slide down cellar and fetch it and then mosey right down the lightningrod and come along ill go and stuff the straw into jims clothes to represent his mother in disguise and be ready to ba like a sheep and shove soon as you get there so out he went and down cellar went i the hunk of butter big as a persons fist was where i had left it so i took up the slab of corn pone with it on and blowed out my light and started up stairs very stealthy and got up to the main floor all right but here comes aunt sally with a candle and i clapped the truck in my hat and clapped my hat on my head and the next second she see me and she says you been down cellar yesm what you been doing down there nothn nothn nom well then what possessed you to go down there this time of night i dont know m you dont know dont answer me that way tom i want to know what you been doing down there i haint been doing a single thing aunt sally i hope to gracious if i have i reckoned shed let me go now and as a generl thing she would but i spose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that warnt yardstick straight so she says very decided you just march into that settingroom and stay there till i come you been up to something you no business to and i lay ill find out what it is before im done with you so she went away as i opened the door and walked into the settingroom my but there was a crowd there fifteen farmers and every one of them had a gun i was most powerful sick and slunk to a chair and set down they was setting around some of them talking a little in a low voice and all of them fidgety and uneasy but trying to look like they warnt but i knowed they was because they was always taking off their hats and putting them on and scratching their heads and changing their seats and fumbling with their buttons i warnt easy myself but i didnt take my hat off all the same illustration every one had a gun i did wish aunt sally would come and get done with me and lick me if she wanted to and let me get away and tell tom how wed overdone this thing and what a thundering hornetsnest wed got ourselves into so we could stop fooling around straight off and clear out with jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us at last she come and begun to ask me questions but i couldnt answer them straight i didnt know which end of me was up because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right now and lay for them desperadoes and saying it warnt but a few minutes to midnight and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep signal and here was aunty pegging away at the questions and me a shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks i was that scared and the place getting hotter and hotter and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears and pretty soon when one of them says im for going and getting in the cabin first and right now and catching them when they come i most dropped and a streak of butter come atrickling down my forehead and aunt sally she see it and turns white as a sheet and says for the lands sake what is the matter with the child hes got the brainfever as shore as youre born and theyre oozing out and everybody runs to see and she snatches off my hat and out comes the bread and what was left of the butter and she grabbed me and hugged me and says oh what a turn you did give me and how glad and grateful i am it aint no worse for lucks against us and it never rains but it pours and when i see that truck i thought wed lost you for i knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains would be ifdear dear whydnt you tell me that was what youd been down there for i wouldnt a cared now cler out to bed and dont lemme see no more of you till morning i was up stairs in a second and down the lightningrod in another one and shinning through the dark for the leanto i couldnt hardly get my words out i was so anxious but i told tom as quick as i could we must jump for it now and not a minute to losethe house full of men yonder with guns his eyes just blazed and he says nois that so aint it bully why huck if it was to do over again i bet i could fetch two hundred if we could put it off till hurry hurry i says wheres jim right at your elbow if you reach out your arm you can touch him hes dressed and everythings ready now well slide out and give the sheep signal but then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door and heard them begin to fumble with the padlock and heard a man say i told you wed be too soon they havent comethe door is locked here ill lock some of you into the cabin and you lay for em in the dark and kill em when they come and the rest scatter around a piece and listen if you can hear em coming so in they come but couldnt see us in the dark and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed but we got under all right and out through the hole swift but softjim first me next and tom last which was according to toms orders now we was in the lean to and heard trampings close by outside so we crept to the door and tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack but couldnt make out nothing it was so dark and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further and when he nudged us jim must glide out first and him last so he set his ear to the crack and listened and listened and listened and the steps ascraping around out there all the time and at last he nudged us and we slid out and stooped down not breathing and not making the least noise and slipped stealthy towards the fence in injun file and got to it all right and me and jim over it but toms britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail and then he hear the steps coming so he had to pull loose which snapped the splinter and made a noise and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out illustration tom caught on a splinter whos that answer or ill shoot but we didnt answer we just unfurled our heels and shoved then there was a rush and a bang bang bang and the bullets fairly whizzed around us we heard them sing out here they are theyve broke for the river after em boys and turn loose the dogs so here they come full tilt we could hear them because they wore boots and yelled but we didnt wear no boots and didnt yell we was in the path to the mill and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by and then dropped in behind them theyd had all the dogs shut up so they wouldnt scare off the robbers but by this time somebody had let them loose and here they come making powwow enough for a million but they was our dogs so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up and when they see it warnt nobody but us and no excitement to offer them they only just said howdy and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering and then we upsteam again and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river but didnt make no more noise than we was obleeged to then we struck out easy and comfortable for the island where my raft was and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out and when we stepped on to the raft i says now old jim youre a free man again and i bet you wont ever be a slave no more en a mighty good job it wuz too huck it uz planned beautiful en it uz done beautiful en dey aint nobody kin git up a plan dats mo mixedup en splendid den what dat one wuz we was all glad as we could be but tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg when me and jim heard that we didnt feel so brash as what we did before it was hurting him considerable and bleeding so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the dukes shirts for to bandage him but he says gimme the rags i can do it myself dont stop now dont fool around here and the evasion booming along so handsome man the sweeps and set her loose boys we done it elegantdeed we did i wish wed a had the handling of louis xvi there wouldnt a been no son of saint louis ascend to heaven wrote down in his biography no sir wed a whooped him over the borderthats what wed a done with himand done it just as slick as nothing at all too man the sweepsman the sweeps but me and jim was consultingand thinking and after wed thought a minute i says say it jim so he says well den dis is de way it look to me huck ef it wuz him dat uz bein sot free en one er de boys wuz to git shot would he say go on en save me nemmine bout a doctor fr to save dis one is dat like mars tom sawyer would he say dat you bet he wouldnt well den is jim gywne to say it no sahi doan budge a step outn dis place dout a doctor not if its forty year illustration jim advises a doctor i knowed he was white inside and i reckoned hed say what he did sayso it was all right now and i told tom i was agoing for a doctor he raised considerable row about it but me and jim stuck to it and wouldnt budge so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself but we wouldnt let him then he give us a piece of his mind but it didnt do no good so when he sees me getting the canoe ready he says well then if youre bound to go ill tell you the way to do when you get to the village shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast and make him swear to be silent as the grave and put a purse full of gold in his hand and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark and then fetch him here in the canoe in a roundabout way amongst the islands and search him and take his chalk away from him and dont give it back to him till you get him back to the village or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again its the way they all do so i said i would and left and jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again illustration the doctor chapter xli the doctor was an old man a very nice kindlooking old man when i got him up i told him me and my brother was over on spanish island hunting yesterday afternoon and camped on a piece of a raft we found and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams for it went off and shot him in the leg and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it nor let anybody know because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks who is your folks he says the phelpses down yonder oh he says and after a minute he says howd you say he got shot he had a dream i says and it shot him singular dream he says so he lit up his lantern and got his saddlebags and we started but when he sees the canoe he didnt like the look of hersaid she was big enough for one but didnt look pretty safe for two i says oh you neednt be afeard sir she carried the three of us easy enough what three why me and sid andandand the guns thats what i mean oh he says but he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her and shook his head and said he reckoned hed look around for a bigger one but they was all locked and chained so he took my canoe and said for me to wait till he come back or i could hunt around further or maybe i better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if i wanted to but i said i didnt so i told him just how to find the raft and then he started i struck an idea pretty soon i says to myself sposn he cant fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheeps tail as the saying is sposn it takes him three or four days what are we going to dolay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag no sir i know what ill do ill wait and when he comes back if he says hes got to go any more ill get down there too if i swim and well take and tie him and keep him and shove out down the river and when toms done with him well give him what its worth or all we got and then let him get ashore so then i crept into a lumberpile to get some sleep and next time i waked up the sun was away up over my head i shot out and went for the doctors house but they told me hed gone away in the night some time or other and warnt back yet well thinks i that looks powerful bad for tom and ill dig out for the island right off so away i shoved and turned the corner and nearly rammed my head into uncle silass stomach he says why tom where you been all this time you rascal illustration uncle silas in danger i haint been nowheres i says only just hunting for the runaway niggerme and sid why where ever did you go he says your aunts been mighty uneasy she neednt i says because we was all right we followed the men and the dogs but they outrun us and we lost them but we thought we heard them on the water so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over but couldnt find nothing of them so we cruised along up shore till we got kind of tired and beat out and tied up the canoe and went to sleep and never waked up till about an hour ago then we paddled over here to hear the news and sids at the postoffice to see what he can hear and im abranching out to get something to eat for us and then were going home so then we went to the postoffice to get sid but just as i suspicioned he warnt there so the old man he got a letter out of the office and we waited awhile longer but sid didnt come so the old man said come along let sid foot it home or canoe it when he got done fooling aroundbut we would ride i couldnt get him to let me stay and wait for sid and he said there warnt no use in it and i must come along and let aunt sally see we was all right when we got home aunt sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both and hugged me and give me one of them lickings of hern that dont amount to shucks and said shed serve sid the same when he come and the place was plum full of farmers and farmers wives to dinner and such another

kind of a fluster i was in by the time midnight come last night i hope to gracious if i warnt afraid theyd steal some o the family i was just to that pass i didnt have no reasoning faculties no more it looks foolish enough now in the daytime but i says to myself theres my two poor boys asleep way up stairs in that lonesome room and i declare to goodness i was that uneasy t i crep up there and locked em in i did and anybody would because you know when you get scared that way and it keeps running on and getting worse and worse all the time and your wits gets to addling and you get to doing all sorts o wild things and by and by you think to yourself sposn i was a boy and was away up there and the door aint locked and you she stopped looking kind of wondering and then she turned her head around slow and when her eye lit on mei got up and took a walk says i to myself i can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if i go out to one side and study over it a little so i done it but i dasnt go fur or shed a sent for me and when it was late in the day the people all went and then i come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and sid and the door was locked and we wanted to see the fun so we went down the lightningrod and both of us got hurt a little and we didnt never want to try that no more and then i went on and told her all what i told uncle silas before and then she said shed forgive us and maybe it was all right enough anyway and about what a body might expect of boys for all boys was a pretty harum scarum lot as fur as she could see and so as long as no harm hadnt come of it she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still stead of fretting over what was past and done so then she kissed me and patted me on the head and dropped into a kind of a brown study and pretty soon jumps up and says why lawsamercy its most night and sid not come yet what has become of that boy i see my chance so i skips up and says ill run right up to town and get him i says no you wont she says youll stay right wher you are ones enough to be lost at a time if he aint here to supper your uncle ll go well he warnt there to supper so right after supper uncle went he come back about ten a little bit uneasy hadnt run across toms track aunt sally was a good deal uneasy but uncle silas he said there warnt no occasion to beboys will be boys he said and youll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right so she had to be satisfied but she said shed set up for him a while anyway and keep a light burning so he could see it illustration aunt sally talks to huck and then when i went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle and tucked me in and mothered me so good i felt mean and like i couldnt look her in the face and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time and said what a splendid boy sid was and didnt seem to want to ever stop talking about him and kept asking me every now and then if i reckoned he could a got lost or hurt or maybe drownded and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead and she not by him to help him and so the tears would drip down silent and i would tell her that sid was all right and would be home in the morning sure and she would squeeze my hand or maybe kiss me and tell me to say it again and keep on saying it because it done her good and she was in so much trouble and when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle and says the door aint going to be locked tom and theres the window and the rod but youll be good wont you and you wont go for my sake laws knows i wanted to go bad enough to see about tom and was all intending to go but after that i wouldnt a went not for kingdoms but she was on my mind and tom was on my mind so i slept very restless and twice i went down the rod away in the night and slipped around front and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them and i wished i could do something for her but i couldnt only to swear that i wouldnt never do nothing to grieve her any more and the third time i waked up at dawn and slid down and she was there yet and her candle was most out and her old gray head was resting on her hand and she was asleep illustration tom sawyer wounded chapter xlii the old man was uptown again before breakfast but couldnt get no track of tom and both of them set at the table thinking and not saying nothing and looking mournful and their coffee getting cold and not eating anything and by and by the old man says did i give you the letter what letter the one i got yesterday out of the postoffice no you didnt give me no letter well i must a forgot it so he rummaged his pockets and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down and fetched it and give it to her she says why its from st petersburgits from sis i allowed another walk would do me good but i couldnt stir but before she could break it open she dropped it and runfor she see something and so did i it was tom sawyer on a mattress and that old doctor and jim in her calico dress with his hands tied behind him and a lot of people i hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy and rushed she flung herself at tom crying and says oh hes dead hes dead i know hes dead and tom he turned his head a little and muttered something or other which showed he warnt in his right mind then she flung up her hands and says hes alive thank god and thats enough and she snatched a kiss of him and flew for the house to get the bed ready and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else as fast as her tongue could go every jump of the way i followed the men to see what they was going to do with jim and the old doctor and uncle silas followed after tom into the house the men was very huffy and some of them wanted to hang jim for an example to all the other niggers around there so they wouldnt be trying to run away like jim done and making such a raft of trouble and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights but the others said dont do it it wouldnt answer at all he aint our nigger and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him sure so that cooled them down a little because the people thats always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that haint done just right is always the very ones that aint the most anxious to pay for him when theyve got their satisfaction out of him they cussed jim considerble though and give him a cuff or two side the head once in a while but jim never said nothing and he never let on to know me and they took him to the same cabin and put his own clothes on him and chained him again and not to no bedleg this time but to a big staple drove into the bottom log and chained his hands too and both legs and said he warnt to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come or he was sold at auction because he didnt come in a certain length of time and filled up our hole and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl goodbye cussing and then the old doctor comes and takes a look and says dont be no rougher on him than youre obleeged to because he aint a bad nigger when i got to where i found the boy i see i couldnt cut the bullet out without some help and he warnt in no condition for me to leave to go and get help and he got a little worse and a little worse and after a long time he went out of his head and wouldnt let me come anigh him any more and said if i chalked his raft hed kill me and no end of wild foolishness like that and i see i couldnt do anything at all with him so i says i got to have help somehow and the minute i says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says hell help and he done it too and done it very well of course i judged he must be a runaway nigger and there i was and there i had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night it was a fix i tell you i had a couple of patients with the chills and of course id of liked to run up to town and see them but i dasnt because the nigger might get away and then id be to blame and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail so there i had to stick plumb until daylight this morning and i never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller and yet he was risking his freedom to do it and was all tired out too and i see plain enough hed been worked main hard lately i liked the nigger for that i tell you gentlemen a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollarsand kind treatment too i had everything i needed and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at homebetter maybe because it was so quiet but there i was with both of m on my hands and there i had to stick till about dawn this morning then some men in a skiff come by and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep so i motioned them in quiet and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about and we never had no trouble and the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep too we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on and towed her over very nice and quiet and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start he aint no bad nigger gentlemen thats what i think about him illustration the doctor speaks for jim somebody says well it sounds very good doctor im obleeged to say then the others softened up a little too and i was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing jim that good turn and i was glad it was according to my judgment of him too because i thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time i see him then they all agreed that jim had acted very well and was deserving to have some notice took of it and reward so every one of them promised right out and hearty that they wouldnt cuss him no more then they come out and locked him up i hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off because they was rotten heavy or could have meat and greens with his bread and water but they didnt think of it and i reckoned it warnt best for me to mix in but i judged id get the doctors yarn to aunt sally somehow or other as soon as id got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of meexplanations i mean of how i forgot to mention about sid being shot when i was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger but i had plenty time aunt sally she stuck to the sickroom all day and all night and every time i see uncle silas mooning around i dodged him next morning i heard tom was a good deal better and they said aunt sally was gone to get a nap so i slips to the sickroom and if i found him awake i reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash but he was sleeping and sleeping very peaceful too and pale not fire faced the way he was when he come so i set down and laid for him to wake in about half an hour aunt sally comes gliding in and there i was up a stump again she motioned me to be still and set down by me and begun to whisper and said we could all be joyful now because all the symptoms was firstrate and hed been sleeping like that for ever so long and looking better and peacefuller all the time and ten to one hed wake up in his right mind so we set there watching and by and by he stirs a bit and opened his eyes very natural and takes a look and says hellowhy im at home hows that wheres the raft its all right i says and jim the same i says but couldnt say it pretty brash but he never noticed but says good splendid now were all right and safe did you tell aunty i was going to say yes but she chipped in and says about what sid why about the way the whole thing was done what whole thing why the whole thing there aint but one how we set the runaway nigger freeme and tom good land set the runwhat is the child talking about dear dear out of his head again no i aint out of my head i know all what im talking about we did set him freeme and tom we laid out to do it and we done it and we done it elegant too hed got a start and she never checked him up just set and stared and stared and let him clip along and i see it warnt no use for me to put in why aunty it cost us a power of workweeks of ithours and hours every night whilst you was all asleep and we had to steal candles and the sheet and the shirt and your dress and spoons and tin plates and caseknives and the warmingpan and the grindstone and flour and just no end of things and you cant think what work it was to make the saws and pens and inscriptions and one thing or another and you cant think half the fun it was and we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things and nonnamous letters from the robbers and get up and down the lightning rod and dig the hole into the cabin and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket mercy sakes and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on for company for jim and then you kept tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business because the men come before we was out of the cabin and we had to rush and they heard us and let drive at us and i got my share and we dodged out of the path and let them go by and when the dogs come they warnt interested in us but went for the most noise and we got our canoe and made for the raft and was all safe and jim was a free man and we done it all by ourselves and wasnt it bully aunty well i never heard the likes of it in all my born days so it was you you little rapscallions thats been making all this trouble and turned everybodys wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death ive as good a notion as ever i had in my life to take it out o you this very minute to think here ive been night after night ayou just get well once you young scamp and i lay ill tan the old harry out o both o ye but tom he was so proud and joyful he just couldnt hold in and his tongue just went itshe achipping in and spitting fire all along and both of them going it at once like a cat convention and she says well you get all the enjoyment you can out of it now for mind i tell you if i catch you meddling with him again meddling with who tom says dropping his smile and looking surprised with who why the runaway nigger of course whod you reckon tom looks at me very grave and says tom didnt you just tell me he was all right hasnt he got away him says aunt sally the runaway nigger deed he hasnt theyve got him back safe and sound and hes in that cabin again on bread and water and loaded down with chains till hes claimed or sold illustration tom rose square up in bed tom rose square up in bed with his eye hot and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills and sings out to me they haint no right to shut him up shoveand dont you lose a minute turn him loose he aint no slave hes as free as any cretur that walks this earth what does the child mean i mean every word i say aunt sally and if somebody dont go ill go ive knowed him all his life and so has tom there old miss watson died two months ago and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river and said so and she set him free in her will then what on earth did you want to set him free for seeing he was already free well that is a question i must say and just like women why i wanted the adventure of it and id a waded neckdeep in blood togoodness alive aunt polly if she warnt standing right there just inside the door looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie i wish i may never aunt sally jumped for her and most hugged the head off of her and cried over her and i found a good enough place for me under the bed for it was getting pretty sultry for us seemed to me and i peeped out and in a little while toms aunt polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at tom over her spectacleskind of grinding him into the earth you know and then she says yes you better turn yr head awayi would if i was you tom oh deary me says aunt sally is he changed so why that aint tom its sid tomstomswhy where is tom he was here a minute ago you mean wheres huck finnthats what you mean i reckon i haint raised such a scamp as my tom all these years not to know him when i see him that would be a pretty howdydo come out from under that bed huck finn so i done it but not feeling brash aunt sally she was one of the mixedupestlooking persons i ever seeexcept one and that was uncle silas when he come in and they told it all to him it kind of made him drunk as you may say and he didnt know nothing at all the rest of the day and preached a prayermeeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation because the oldest man in the world couldnt a understood it so toms aunt polly she told all about who i was and what and i had to up and tell how i was in such a tight place that when mrs phelps took me for tom sawyershe chipped in and says oh go on and call me aunt sally im used to it now and taint no need to changethat when aunt sally took me for tom sawyer i had to stand itthere warnt no other way and i knowed he wouldnt mind because it would be nuts for him being a mystery and hed make an adventure out of it and be perfectly satisfied and so it turned out and he let on to be sid and made things as soft as he could for me and his aunt polly she said tom was right about old miss watson setting jim free in her will and so sure enough tom sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free and i couldnt ever understand before until that minute and that talk how he could help a body set a nigger free with his bringingup well aunt polly she said that when aunt sally wrote to her that tom and sid had come all right and safe she says to herself look at that now i might have expected it letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him so now i got to go and trapse all the way down the river eleven hundred mile and find out what that creeturs up to this time as long as i couldnt seem to get any answer out of you about it why i never heard nothing from you says aunt sally well i wonder why i wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by sid being here well i never got em sis aunt polly she turns around slow and severe and says you tom wellwhat he says kind of pettish dont you what me you impudent thinghand out them letters illustration hand out them letters what letters them letters i be bound if i have to take aholt of you ill theyre in the trunk there now and theyre just the same as they was when i got them out of the office i haint looked into them i haint touched them but i knowed theyd make trouble and i thought if you warnt in no hurry id well you do need skinning there aint no mistake about it and i wrote another one to tell you i was coming and i spose he no it come yesterday i haint read it yet but its all right ive got that one i wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadnt but i reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to so i never said nothing illustration out of bondage chapter the last the first time i catched tom private i asked him what was his idea time of the evasionwhat it was hed planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before and he said what he had planned in his head from the start if we got jim out all safe was for us to run him down the river on the raft and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river and then tell him about his being free and take him back up home on a steamboat in style and pay him for his lost time and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brassband and then he would be a hero and so would we but i reckoned it was about as well the way it was we had jim out of the chains in no time and when aunt polly and uncle silas and aunt sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse tom they made a heap of fuss over him and fixed him up prime and give him all he wanted to eat and a good time and nothing to do and we had him up to the sickroom and had a high talk and tom give jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient and doing it up so good and jim was pleased most to death and busted out and says illustration toms liberality dah now huck what i tell youwhat i tell you up dah on jackson islan i tole you i got a hairy breas en whats de sign un it en i tole you i ben rich wunst en gwineter to be rich agin en its come true en heah she is dah now doan talk to mesigns is signs mine i tell you en i knowed jis s well at i uz gwineter be rich agin as is astannin heah dis minute and then tom he talked along and talked along and says les all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit and go for howling adventures amongst the injuns over in the territory for a couple of weeks or two and i says all right that suits me but i aint got no money for to buy the outfit and i reckon i couldnt get none from home because its likely paps been back before now and got it all away from judge thatcher and drunk it up no he haint tom says its all there yetsix thousand dollars and more and your pap haint ever been back since hadnt when i come away anyhow jim says kind of solemn he aint acomin back no mo huck i says why jim nemmine why huckbut he aint comin back no mo but i kept at him so at last he says doan you member de house dat was floatn down de river en dey wuz a man in dah kivered up en i went in en unkivered him and didn let you come in well den you kin git yo money when you wants it kase dat wuz him toms most well now and got his bullet around his neck on a watchguard for a watch and is always seeing what time it is and so there aint nothing more to write about and i am rotten glad of it because if id a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book i wouldnt a tackled it and aint agoing to no more but i reckon i got to light out for the territory ahead of the rest because aunt sally shes going to adopt me and sivilize me and i cant stand it i been there before illustration the end yours truly

ulysses by james joyce i stately plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed a yellow dressinggown ungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air he held the bowl aloft and intoned introibo ad altare dei halted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely come up kinch come up you fearful jesuit solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and the awaking mountains then catching sight of stephen dedalus he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat and shaking his head stephen dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hair grained and hued like pale oak buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly back to barracks he said sternly he added in a preachers tone for this o dearly beloved is the genuine christine body and soul and blood and ouns slow music please shut your eyes gents one moment a little trouble about those white corpuscles silence all he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call then paused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points chrysostomos two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm thanks old chap he cried briskly that will do nicely switch off the current will you he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown the plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middle ages a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips the mockery of it he said gaily your absurd name an ancient greek he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet laughing to himself stephen dedalus stepped up followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck buck mulligans gay voice went on my name is absurd too malachi mulligan two dactyls but it has a hellenic ring hasnt it tripping and sunny like the buck himself we must go to athens will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid he laid the brush aside and laughing with delight cried will he come the jejune jesuit ceasing he began to shave with care tell me mulligan stephen said quietly yes my love how long is haines going to stay in this tower buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder god isnt he dreadful he said frankly a ponderous saxon he thinks youre not a gentleman god these bloody english bursting with money and indigestion because he comes from oxford you know dedalus you have the real oxford manner he cant make you out o my name for you is the best kinch the knifeblade he shaved warily over his chin he was raving all night about a black panther stephen said where is his guncase a woful lunatic mulligan said were you in a funk i was stephen said with energy and growing fear out here in the dark with a man i dont know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther you saved men from drowning im not a hero however if he stays on here i am off buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade he hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily scutter he cried thickly he came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into stephens upper pocket said lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly then gazing over the handkerchief he said the bards noserag a new art colour for our irish poets snotgreen you can almost taste it cant you he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly god he said quietly isnt the sea what algy calls it a grey sweet mother the snotgreen sea the scrotumtightening sea epi oinopa ponton ah dedalus the greeks i must teach you you must read them in the original thalatta thalatta she is our great sweet mother come and look stephen stood up and went over to the parapet leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of kingstown our mighty mother buck mulligan said he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephens face the aunt thinks you killed your mother he said thats why she wont let me have anything to do with you someone killed her stephen said gloomily you could have knelt down damn it kinch when your dying mother asked you buck mulligan said im hyperborean as much as you but to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her and you refused there is something sinister in you he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek a tolerant smile curled his lips but a lovely mummer he murmured to himself kinch the loveliest mummer of them all he shaved evenly and with care in silence seriously stephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coatsleeve pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heart silently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faint odour of wetted ashes across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him the ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid a bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade ah poor dogsbody he said in a kind voice i must give you a shirt and a few noserags how are the secondhand breeks they fit well enough stephen answered buck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip the mockery of it he said contentedly secondleg they should be god knows what poxy bowsy left them off i have a lovely pair with a hair stripe grey youll look spiffing in them im not joking kinch you look damn well when youre dressed thanks stephen said i cant wear them if they are grey he cant wear them buck mulligan told his face in the mirror etiquette is etiquette he kills his mother but he cant wear grey trousers he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes that fellow i was with in the ship last night said buck mulligan says you have gpi hes up in dottyville with connolly norman general paralysis of the insane he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea his curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk look at yourself he said you dreadful bard stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleft by a crooked crack hair on end as he and others see me who chose this face for me this dogsbody to rid of vermin it asks me too i pinched it out of the skivvys room buck mulligan said it does her all right the aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for malachi lead him not into temptation and her name is ursula laughing again he brought the mirror away from stephens peering eyes the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said if wilde were only alive to see you drawing back and pointing stephen said with bitterness it is a symbol of irish art the cracked lookingglass of a servant buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephens and walked with him round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them its not fair to tease you like that kinch is it he said kindly god knows you have more spirit than any of them parried again he fears the lancet of my art as i fear that of his the cold steelpen cracked lookingglass of a servant tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea hes stinking with money and thinks youre not a gentleman his old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to zulus or some bloody swindle or other god kinch if you and i could only work together we might do something for the island hellenise it cranlys arm his arm and to think of your having to beg from these swine im the only one that knows what you are why dont you trust me more what have you up your nose against me is it haines if he makes any noise here ill bring down seymour and well give him a ragging worse than they gave clive kempthorpe young shouts of moneyed voices in clive kempthorpes rooms palefaces they hold their ribs with laughter one clasping another o i shall expire break the news to her gently aubrey i shall die with slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table with trousers down at heels chased by ades of magdalen with the tailors shears a scared calfs face gilded with marmalade i dont want to be debagged dont you play the giddy ox with me shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle a deaf gardener aproned masked with matthew arnolds face pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms to ourselves new paganism omphalos let him stay stephen said theres nothing wrong with him except at night then what is it buck mulligan asked impatiently cough it up im quite frank with you what have you against me now they halted looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale stephen freed his arm quietly do you wish me to tell you he asked yes what is it buck mulligan answered i dont remember anything he looked in stephens face as he spoke a light wind passed his brow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes stephen depressed by his own voice said do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mothers death buck mulligan frowned quickly and said what where i cant remember anything i remember only ideas and sensations why what happened in the name of god you were making tea stephen said and went across the landing to get more hot water your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom she asked you who was in your room yes buck mulligan said what did i say i forget you said stephen answered o its only dedalus whose mother is beastly dead a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck mulligans cheek did i say that he asked well what harm is that he shook his constraint from him nervously and what is death he asked your mothers or yours or my own you saw only your mother die i see them pop off every day in the mater and richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom its a beastly thing and nothing else it simply doesnt matter you wouldnt kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you why because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you only its injected the wrong way to me its all a mockery and beastly her cerebral lobes are not functioning she calls the doctor sir peter teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt humour her till its over you crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because i dont whinge like some hired mute from lalouettes absurd i suppose i did say it i didnt mean to offend the memory of your mother he had spoken himself into boldness stephen shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart said very coldly i am not thinking of the offence to my mother of what then buck mulligan asked of the offence to me stephen answered buck mulligan swung round on his heel o an impossible person he exclaimed he walked off quickly round the parapet stephen stood at his post gazing over the calm sea towards the headland sea and headland now grew dim pulses were beating in his eyes veiling their sight and he felt the fever of his cheeks a voice within the tower called loudly are you up there mulligan im coming buck mulligan answered he turned towards stephen and said look at the sea what does it care about offences chuck loyola kinch and come on down the sassenach wants his morning rashers his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase level with the roof dont mope over it all day he said im inconsequent give up the moody brooding his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead and no more turn aside and brood upon loves bitter mystery for fergus rules the brazen cars woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened spurned by lightshod hurrying feet white breast of the dim sea the twining stresses two by two a hand plucking the harpstrings merging their twining chords wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide a cloud began to cover the sun slowly wholly shadowing the bay in deeper green it lay beneath him a bowl of bitter waters fergus song i sang it alone in the house holding down the long dark chords her door was open she wanted to hear my music silent with awe and pity i went to her bedside she was crying in her wretched bed for those words stephen loves bitter mystery where now her secrets old featherfans tasselled dancecards powdered with musk a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer a birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl she heard old royce sing in the pantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang i am the boy that can enjoy invisibility phantasmal mirth folded away muskperfumed and no more turn aside and brood folded away in the memory of nature with her toys memories beset his brooding brain her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament a cored apple filled with brown sugar roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the childrens shirts in a dream silently she had come to him her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath bent over him with mute secret words a faint odour of wetted ashes her glazing eyes staring out of death to shake and bend my soul on me alone the ghostcandle to light her agony ghostly light on the tortured face her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror while all prayed on their knees her eyes on me to strike me down liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat ghoul chewer of corpses no mother let me be and let me live kinch ahoy buck mulligans voice sang from within the tower it came nearer up the staircase calling again stephen still trembling at his souls cry heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words dedalus come down like a good mosey breakfast is ready haines is apologising for waking us last night its all right im coming stephen said turning do for jesus sake buck mulligan said for my sake and for all our sakes his head disappeared and reappeared i told him your symbol of irish art he says its very clever touch him for a quid will you a guinea i mean i get paid this morning stephen said the school kip buck mulligan said how much four quid lend us one if you want it stephen said four shining sovereigns buck mulligan cried with delight well have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids four omnipotent sovereigns he flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs singing out of tune with a cockney accent o wont we have a merry time drinking whisky beer and wine on coronation coronation day o wont we have a merry time on coronation day warm sunshine merrying over the sea the nickel shavingbowl shone forgotten on the parapet why should i bring it down or leave it there all day forgotten friendship he went over to it held it in his hands awhile feeling its coolness smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes i am another now and yet the same a servant too a server of a servant in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligans gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth hiding and revealing its yellow glow two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated turning well be choked buck mulligan said haines open that door will you stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker a tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors have you the key a voice asked dedalus has it buck mulligan said janey mack im choked he howled without looking up from the fire kinch its in the lock stephen said coming forward the key scraped round harshly twice and when the heavy door had been set ajar welcome light and bright air entered haines stood at the doorway looking out stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table set them down heavily and sighed with relief im melting he said as the candle remarked when but hush not a word more on that subject kinch wake up bread butter honey haines come in the grub is ready bless us o lord and these thy gifts wheres the sugar o jay theres no milk stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet what sort of a kip is this he said i told her to come after eight we can drink it black stephen said thirstily theres a lemon in the locker o damn you and your paris fads buck mulligan said i want sandycove milk haines came in from the doorway and said quietly that woman is coming up with the milk the blessings of god on you buck mulligan cried jumping up from his chair sit down pour out the tea there the sugar is in the bag here i cant go fumbling at the damned eggs he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates saying in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti haines sat down to pour out the tea im giving you two lumps each he said but i say mulligan you do make strong tea dont you buck mulligan hewing thick slices from the loaf said in an old womans wheedling voice when i makes tea i makes tea as old mother grogan said and when i makes water i makes water by jove it is tea haines said buck mulligan went on hewing and wheedling so i do mrs cahill says she begob maam says mrs cahill god send you dont make them in the one pot he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread impaled on his knife thats folk he said very earnestly for your book haines five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of dundrum printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice lifting his brows can you recall brother is mother grogans tea and water pot spoken of in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads i doubt it said stephen gravely do you now buck mulligan said in the same tone your reasons pray i fancy stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of the mabinogion mother grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of mary ann buck mulligans face smiled with delight charming he said in a finical sweet voice showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly do you think she was quite charming then suddenly overclouding all his features he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf for old mary ann she doesnt care a damn but hising up her petticoats he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned the doorway was darkened by an entering form the milk sir come in maam mulligan said kinch get the jug an old woman came forward and stood by stephens elbow thats a lovely morning sir she said glory be to god to whom mulligan said glancing at her ah to be sure stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker the islanders mulligan said to haines casually speak frequently of the collector of prepuces how much sir asked the old woman a quart stephen said he watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk not hers old shrunken paps she poured again a measureful and a tilly old and secret she had entered from a morning world maybe a messenger she praised the goodness of the milk pouring it out crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field a witch on her toadstool her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs they lowed about her whom they knew dewsilky cattle silk of the kine and poor old woman names given her in old times a wandering crone lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer their common cuckquean a messenger from the secret morning to serve or to upbraid whether he could not tell but scorned to beg her favour it is indeed maam buck mulligan said pouring milk into their cups taste it sir she said he drank at her bidding if we could live on good food like that he said to her somewhat loudly we wouldnt have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts living in a bogswamp eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust horsedung and consumptives spits are you a medical student sir the old woman asked i am maam buck mulligan answered look at that now she said stephen listened in scornful silence she bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly her bonesetter her medicineman me she slights to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her womans unclean loins of mans flesh made not in gods likeness the serpents prey and to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes do you understand what he says stephen asked her is it french you are talking sir the old woman said to haines haines spoke to her again a longer speech confidently irish buck mulligan said is there gaelic on you i thought it was irish she said by the sound of it are you from the west sir i am an englishman haines answered hes english buck mulligan said and he thinks we ought to speak irish in ireland sure we ought to the old woman said and im ashamed i dont speak the language myself im told its a grand language by them that knows grand is no name for it said buck mulligan wonderful entirely fill us out some more tea kinch would you like a cup maam no thank you sir the old woman said slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go haines said to her have you your bill we had better pay her mulligan hadnt we stephen filled again the three cups bill sir she said halting well its seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling thats a shilling and one and two is two and two sir buck mulligan sighed and having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets pay up and look pleasant haines said to him smiling stephen filled a third cup a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk buck mulligan brought up a florin twisted it round in his fingers and cried a miracle he passed it along the table towards the old woman saying ask nothing more of me sweet all i can give you i give stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand well owe twopence he said time enough sir she said taking the coin time enough good morning sir she curtseyed and went out followed by buck mulligans tender chant heart of my heart were it more more would be laid at your feet he turned to stephen and said seriously dedalus im stony hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money today the bards must drink and junket ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty that reminds me haines said rising that i have to visit your national library today our swim first buck mulligan said he turned to stephen and asked blandly is this the day for your monthly wash kinch then he said to haines the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month all ireland is washed by the gulfstream stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me speaking to me they wash and tub and scrub agenbite of inwit conscience yet heres a spot that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of irish art is deuced good buck mulligan kicked stephens foot under the table and said with warmth of tone wait till you hear him on hamlet haines well i mean it haines said still speaking to stephen i was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in would i make any money by it stephen asked haines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock said i dont know im sure he strolled out to the doorway buck mulligan bent across to stephen and said with coarse vigour you put your hoof in it now what did you say that for well stephen said the problem is to get money from whom from the milkwoman or from him its a toss up i think i blow him out about you buck mulligan said and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes i see little hope stephen said from her or from him buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephens arm from me kinch he said in a suddenly changed tone he added to tell you the gods truth i think youre right damn all else they are good for why dont you play them as i do to hell with them all let us get out of the kip he stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown saying resignedly mulligan is stripped of his garments he emptied his pockets on to the table theres your snotrag he said and putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them chiding them and to his dangling watchchain his hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief god well simply have to dress the character i want puce gloves and green boots contradiction do i contradict myself very well then i contradict myself mercurial malachi a limp black missile flew out of his talking hands and theres your latin quarter hat he said stephen picked it up and put it on haines called to them from the doorway are you coming you fellows im ready buck mulligan answered going towards the door come out kinch you have eaten all we left i suppose resigned he passed out with grave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrow and going forth he met butterly stephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them out and as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and locked it he put the huge key in his inner pocket at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked did you bring the key i have it stephen said preceding them he walked on behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses down sir how dare you sir haines asked do you pay rent for this tower twelve quid buck mulligan said to the secretary of state for war stephen added over his shoulder they halted while haines surveyed the tower and said at last rather bleak in wintertime i should say martello you call it billy pitt had them built buck mulligan said when the french were on the sea but ours is the omphalos what is your idea of hamlet haines asked stephen no no buck mulligan shouted in pain im not equal to thomas aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up wait till i have a few pints in me first he turned to stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat you couldnt manage it under three pints kinch could you it has waited so long stephen said listlessly it can wait longer you pique my curiosity haines said amiably is it some paradox pooh buck mulligan said we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes its quite simple he proves by algebra that hamlets grandson is shakespeares grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father what haines said beginning to point at stephen he himself buck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bending in loose laughter said to stephens ear o shade of kinch the elder japhet in search of a father were always tired in the morning stephen said to haines and it is rather long to tell buck mulligan walking forward again raised his hands the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus he said i mean to say haines explained to stephen as they followed this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore that beetles oer his base into the sea isnt it buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not speak in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires its a wonderful tale haines said bringing them to halt again eyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudent the seas ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the muglins i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemused the father and the son idea the son striving to be atoned with the father buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face he looked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety he moved a dolls head to and fro the brims of his panama hat quivering and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice im the queerest young fellow that ever you heard my mothers a jew my fathers a bird with joseph the joiner i cannot agree so heres to disciples and calvary he held up a forefinger of warning if anyone thinks that i amnt divine hell get no free drinks when im making the wine but have to drink water and wish it were plain that i make when the wine becomes water again he tugged swiftly at stephens ashplant in farewell and running forward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted goodbye now goodbye write down all i said and tell tom dick and harry i rose from the dead whats bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly and olivets breezy goodbye now goodbye he capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole fluttering his winglike hands leaping nimbly mercurys hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries haines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside stephen and said we oughtnt to laugh i suppose hes rather blasphemous im not a believer myself that is to say still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow doesnt it what did he call it joseph the joiner the ballad of joking jesus stephen answered o haines said you have heard it before three times a day after meals stephen said drily youre not a believer are you haines asked i mean a believer in the narrow sense of the word creation from nothing and miracles and a personal god theres only one sense of the word it seems to me stephen said haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone he sprang it open with his thumb and offered it thank you stephen said taking a cigarette haines helped himself and snapped the case to he put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang it open too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towards stephen in the shell of his hands yes of course he said as they went on again either you believe or you dont isnt it personally i couldnt stomach that idea of a personal god you dont stand for that i suppose you behold in me stephen said with grim displeasure a horrible example of free thought he walked on waiting to be spoken to trailing his ashplant by his side its ferrule followed lightly on the path squealing at his heels my familiar after me calling steeeeeeeeeeeephen a wavering line along the path they will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark he wants that key it is mine i paid the rent now i eat his salt bread give him the key too all he will ask for it that was in his eyes after all haines began stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind after all i should think you are able to free yourself you are your own master it seems to me i am a servant of two masters stephen said an english and an italian italian haines said a crazy queen old and jealous kneel down before me and a third stephen said there is who wants me for odd jobs italian haines said again what do you mean the imperial british state stephen answered his colour rising and the holy roman catholic and apostolic church haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke i can quite understand that he said calmly an irishman must think like that i daresay we feel in england that we have treated you rather unfairly it seems history is to blame the proud potent titles clanged over stephens memory the triumph of their brazen bells et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts a chemistry of stars symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope marcellus the voices blended singing alone loud in affirmation and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs a horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry photius and the brood of mockers of whom mulligan was one and arius warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the son with the father and valentine spurning christs terrene body and the subtle african heresiarch sabellius who held that the father was himself his own son words mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger idle mockery the void awaits surely all them that weave the wind a menace a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church michaels host who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields hear hear prolonged applause zut nom de dieu of course im a britisher hainess voice said and i feel as one i dont want to see my country fall into the hands of german jews either thats our national problem im afraid just now two men stood at the verge of the cliff watching businessman boatman shes making for bullock harbour the boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain theres five fathoms out there he said itll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one its nine days today the man that was drowned a sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up roll over to the sun a puffy face saltwhite here i am they followed the winding path down to the creek buck mulligan stood on a stone in shirtsleeves his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder a young man clinging to a spur of rock near him moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water is the brother with you malachi down in westmeath with the bannons still there i got a card from bannon says he found a sweet young thing down there photo girl he calls her snapshot eh brief exposure buck mulligan sat down to unlace his boots an elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face he scrambled up by the stones water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth buck mulligan made way for him to scramble past and glancing at haines and stephen crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone seymours back in town the young man said grasping again his spur of rock chucked medicine and going in for the army ah go to god buck mulligan said going over next week to stew you know that red carlisle girl lily yes spooning with him last night on the pier the father is rotto with money is she up the pole better ask seymour that seymour a bleeding officer buck mulligan said he nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up saying tritely redheaded women buck like goats he broke off in alarm feeling his side under his flapping shirt my twelfth rib is gone he cried im the uebermensch toothless kinch and i the supermen he struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay are you going in here malachi yes make room in the bed the young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes haines sat down on a stone smoking are you not coming in buck mulligan asked later on haines said not on my breakfast stephen turned away im going mulligan he said give us that key kinch buck mulligan said to keep my chemise flat stephen handed him the key buck mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes and twopence he said for a pint throw it there stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap dressing undressing buck mulligan erect with joined hands before him said solemnly he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord thus spake zarathustra his plump body plunged well see you again haines said turning as stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild irish horn of a bull hoof of a horse smile of a saxon the ship buck mulligan cried half twelve good stephen said he walked along the upwardcurving path liliata rutilantium turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum the priests grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly i will not sleep here tonight home also i cannot go a voice sweettoned and sustained called to him from the sea turning the curve he waved his hand it called again a sleek brown head a seals far out on the water round usurper you cochrane what city sent for him tarentum sir very good well there was a battle sir very good where the boys blank face asked the blank window fabled by the daughters of memory and yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it a phrase then of impatience thud of blakes wings of excess i hear the ruin of all space shattered glass and toppling masonry and time one livid final flame whats left us then i forget the place sir 279 b c asculum stephen said glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book yes sir and he said another victory like that and we are done for that phrase the world had remembered a dull ease of the mind from a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers leaned upon his spear any general to any officers they lend ear you armstrong stephen said what was the end of pyrrhus end of pyrrhus sir i know sir ask me sir comyn said wait you armstrong do you know anything about pyrrhus a bag of figrolls lay snugly in armstrongs satchel he curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips a sweetened boys breath welloff people proud that their eldest son was in the navy vico road dalkey pyrrhus sir pyrrhus a pier all laughed mirthless high malicious laughter armstrong looked round at his classmates silly glee in profile in a moment they will laugh more loudly aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay tell me now stephen said poking the boys shoulder with the book what is a pier a pier sir armstrong said a thing out in the water a kind of a bridge kingstown pier sir some laughed again mirthless but with meaning two in the back bench whispered yes they knew had never learned nor ever been innocent all with envy he watched their faces edith ethel gerty lily their likes their breaths too sweetened with tea and jam their bracelets tittering in the struggle kingstown pier stephen said yes a disappointed bridge the words troubled their gaze how sir comyn asked a bridge is across a river for hainess chapbook noone here to hear tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk to pierce the polished mail of his mind what then a jester at the court of his master indulged and disesteemed winning a clement masters praise why had they chosen all that part not wholly for the smooth caress for them too history was a tale like any other too often heard their land a pawnshop had pyrrhus not fallen by a beldams hand in argos or julius caesar not been knifed to death they are not to be thought away time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted but can those have been possible seeing that they never were or was that only possible which came to pass weave weaver of the wind tell us a story sir o do sir a ghoststory where do you begin in this stephen asked opening another book weep no more comyn said go on then talbot and the story sir after stephen said go on talbot a swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel he recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text weep no more woful shepherds weep no more for lycidas your sorrow is not dead sunk though he be beneath the watery floor it must be a movement then an actuality of the possible as possible aristotles phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of saint genevieve where he had read sheltered from the sin of paris night by night by his elbow a delicate siamese conned a handbook of strategy fed and feeding brains about me under glowlamps impaled with faintly beating feelers and in my minds darkness a sloth of the underworld reluctant shy of brightness shifting her dragon scaly folds thought is the thought of thought tranquil brightness the soul is in a manner all that is the soul is the form of forms tranquility sudden vast candescent form of forms talbot repeated through the dear might of him that walked the waves through the dear might turn over stephen said quietly i dont see anything what sir talbot asked simply bending forward his hand turned the page over he leaned back and went on again having just remembered of him that walked the waves here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffers heart and lips and on mine it lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute to caesar what is caesars to god what is gods a long look from dark eyes a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the churchs looms ay riddle me riddle me randy ro my father gave me seeds to sow talbot slid his closed book into his satchel have i heard all stephen asked yes sir hockey at ten sir half day sir thursday who can answer a riddle stephen asked they bundled their books away pencils clacking pages rustling crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels all gabbling gaily a riddle sir ask me sir o ask me sir a hard one sir this is the riddle stephen said the cock crew the sky was blue the bells in heaven were striking eleven tis time for this poor soul to go to heaven what is that what sir again sir we didnt hear their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated after a silence cochrane said what is it sir we give it up stephen his throat itching answered the fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush he stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay a stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called hockey they broke asunder sidling out of their benches leaping them quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly showing an open copybook his thick hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading on his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshaped recent and damp as a snails bed he held out his copybook the word sums was written on the headline beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot cyril sargent his name and seal mr deasy told me to write them out all again he said and show them to you sir stephen touched the edges of the book futility do you understand how to do them now he asked numbers eleven to fifteen sargent answered mr deasy said i was to copy them off the board sir can you do them yourself stephen asked no sir ugly and futile lean neck and thick hair and a stain of ink a snails bed yet someone had loved him borne him in her arms and in her heart but for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot a squashed boneless snail she had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own was that then real the only true thing in life his mothers prostrate body the fiery columbanus in holy zeal bestrode she was no more the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes she had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone scarcely having been a poor soul gone to heaven and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox red reek of rapine in his fur with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth listened scraped up the earth listened scraped and scraped sitting at his side stephen solved out the problem he proves by algebra that shakespeares ghost is hamlets grandfather sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice in the mummery of their letters wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes give hands traverse bow to partner so imps of fancy of the moors gone too from the world averroes and moses maimonides dark men in mien and movement flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend do you understand now can you work the second for yourself yes sir in long shaky strokes sargent copied the data waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin amor matris subjective and objective genitive with her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands like him was i these sloping shoulders this gracelessness my childhood bends beside me too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly mine is far and his secret as our eyes secrets silent stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of their tyranny tyrants willing to be dethroned the sum was done it is very simple stephen said as he stood up yes sir thanks sargent answered he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench you had better get your stick and go out to the others stephen said as he followed towards the door the boys graceless form yes sir in the corridor his name was heard called from the playfield sargent run on stephen said mr deasy is calling you he stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife they were sorted in teams and mr deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet when he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him he turned his angry white moustache what is it now he cried continually without listening cochrane and halliday are on the same side sir stephen said will you wait in my study for a moment mr deasy said till i restore order here and as he stepped fussily back across the field his old mans voice cried sternly what is the matter what is it now their sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many forms closed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs as on the first day he bargained with me here as it was in the beginning is now on the sideboard the tray of stuart coins base treasure of a bog and ever shall be and snug in their spooncase of purple plush faded the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles world without end a hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor blowing out his rare moustache mr deasy halted at the table first our little financial settlement he said he brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong it slapped open and he took from it two notes one of joined halves and laid them carefully on the table two he said strapping and stowing his pocketbook away and now his strongroom for the gold stephens embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar whelks and money cowries and leopard shells and this whorled as an emirs turban and this the scallop of saint james an old pilgrims hoard dead treasure hollow shells a sovereign fell bright and new on the soft pile of the tablecloth three mr deasy said turning his little savingsbox about in his hand these are handy things to have see this is for sovereigns this is for shillings sixpences halfcrowns and here crowns see he shot from it two crowns and two shillings three twelve he said i think youll find thats right thank you sir stephen said gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers no thanks at all mr deasy said you have earned it stephens hand free again went back to the hollow shells symbols too of beauty and of power a lump in my pocket symbols soiled by greed and misery dont carry it like that mr deasy said youll pull it out somewhere and lose it you just buy one of these

his savingsbox i knew you couldnt he said joyously but one day you must feel it we are a generous people but we must also be just i fear those big words stephen said which make us so unhappy mr deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan filibegs albert edward prince of wales you think me an old fogey and an old tory his thoughtful voice said i saw three generations since oconnells time i remember the famine in 46 do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before oconnell did or before the prelates of

and armed the planters covenant the black north and true blue bible croppies lie down stephen sketched a brief gesture i have rebel blood in me too mr deasy said on the spindle side but i am descended

dangling on to dublin lal the ral the ra lal the ral the raddy that reminds me mr deasy said you can do me a favour mr dedalus with some of your literary friends i have a letter here for the press sit down a moment i have just to copy the end he went to the desk near the window pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter sit down excuse me he said over his shoulder the dictates of common sense just a moment he peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and muttering began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage their meek heads poised in air lord hastings repulse the duke of westminsters shotover the duke of beauforts ceylon prix de paris 1866 elfin riders sat them watchful of a sign he saw their speeds backing kings colours and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds full stop mr deasy bade his keys but prompt ventilation of this allimportant question where cranly led me to get rich quick hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen over the motley slush fair rebel fair rebel even money the favourite ten to one the field dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman a butchers dame nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange shouts rang shrill from the boys

jousts time shocked rebounds shock by shock jousts slush and uproar of battles the frozen deathspew of the slain a shout of spearspikes baited with mens bloodied guts now then mr deasy said rising he came to the table pinning together his sheets stephen stood up i have put the matter into a nutshell mr deasy said its about the foot and mouth disease just look through it there can be no two opinions on the matter may i trespass on your valuable space that doctrine of laissez faire which so often in our history our cattle trade the way of all our old industries liverpool ring which jockeyed the galway harbour scheme european conflagration grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel the pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of agriculture pardoned a classical allusion cassandra by a woman who was no better than she should be to come to the point at issue i dont mince words do i mr deasy asked as stephen read on foot and mouth disease known as kochs preparation serum and virus percentage of salted horses rinderpest emperors horses at murzsteg lower austria veterinary surgeons mr henry blackwood price courteous offer a fair trial dictates of common sense allimportant question in every sense of the word take the bull by the horns thanking you for the hospitality of your columns i want that to be printed and read mr deasy said you will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on irish cattle and it can be cured it is cured my cousin blackwood price writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in austria by cattledoctors there they offer to come over here i am trying to work up influence with the department now im going to try publicity i am surrounded by difficulties by intrigues by backstairs influence by he raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke mark my words mr dedalus he said england is in the hands of the jews in all the highest places her finance her press and they are the signs of a nations decay wherever they gather they eat up the nations vital strength i have seen it coming these years as sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction old england is dying he stepped swiftly off his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam he faced about and back again dying he said again if not dead by now the harlots cry from street to street shall weave old englands windingsheet his eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted a merchant stephen said is one who buys cheap and sells dear jew or gentile is he not they sinned against the light mr deasy said gravely and you can see the darkness in their eyes and that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day on the steps of the paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers gabble of geese they swarmed loud uncouth about the temple their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats not theirs these clothes this speech these gestures their full slow eyes belied the words the gestures eager and unoffending but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain vain patience to heap and hoard time surely would scatter all a hoard heaped by the roadside plundered and passing on their eyes knew their years of wandering and patient knew the dishonours of their flesh who has not stephen said what do you mean mr deasy asked he came forward a pace and stood by the table his underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly is this old wisdom he waits to hear from me history stephen said is a nightmare from which i am trying to awake from the playfield the boys raised a shout a whirring whistle goal what if that nightmare gave you a back kick the ways of the creator are not our ways mr deasy said all human history moves towards one great goal the manifestation of god stephen jerked his thumb towards the window saying that is god hooray ay whrrwhee what mr deasy asked a shout in the street stephen answered shrugging his shoulders mr deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers looking up again he set them free i am happier than you are he said we have committed many errors and many sins a woman brought sin into the world for a woman who was no better than she should be helen the runaway wife of menelaus ten years the greeks made war on troy a faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here macmurroughs wife and her leman orourke prince of breffni a woman too brought parnell low many errors many failures but not the one sin i am a struggler now at the end of my days but i will fight for the right till the end for ulster will fight and ulster will be right stephen raised the sheets in his hand well sir he began i foresee mr deasy said that you will not remain here very long at this work you were not born to be a teacher i think perhaps i am wrong a learner rather stephen said and here what will you learn more mr deasy shook his head who knows he said to learn one must be humble but life is the great teacher stephen rustled the sheets again as regards these he began yes mr deasy said you have two copies there if you can have them published at once telegraph irish homestead i will try stephen said and let you know tomorrow i know two editors slightly that will do mr deasy said briskly i wrote last night to mr field mp there is a meeting of the cattletraders association today at the city arms hotel i asked him to lay my letter before the meeting you see if you can get it into your two papers what are they the evening telegraph that will do mr deasy said there is no time to lose now i have to answer that letter from my cousin good morning sir stephen said putting the sheets in his pocket thank you not at all mr deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk i like to break a lance with you old as i am good morning sir stephen said again bowing to his bent back he went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield the lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate toothless terrors still i will help him in his fight mulligan will dub me a new name the bullockbefriending bard mr dedalus running after me no more letters i hope just one moment yes sir stephen said turning back at the gate mr deasy halted breathing hard and swallowing his breath i just wanted to say he said ireland they say has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews do you know that no and do you know why he frowned sternly on the bright air why sir stephen asked beginning to smile because she never let them in mr deasy said solemnly a coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm he turned back quickly coughing laughing his lifted arms waving to the air she never let them in he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path thats why on his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles dancing coins ineluctable modality of the visible at least

cunningham said decisively we must take a charitable view of it they say a man who does it is a coward mr dedalus said it is not for us to judge martin cunningham said mr bloom about to speak closed his lips again martin cunninghams large eyes looking away now sympathetic human man he is intelligent like shakespeares face always a good word to say they have no mercy on that here or infanticide

dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at clonsilla the carriage moved on through the drove i cant make out why the corporation doesnt run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays mr bloom said all those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats instead of blocking up the thoroughfare martin cunningham said quite right they ought to yes mr bloom said and another thing i often thought is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in milan you know run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams hearse and carriage and all dont you see what i mean o that be damned for a story mr dedalus said pullman car and saloon diningroom a poor lookout for corny mr power added why mr bloom asked turning to mr dedalus wouldnt it be more decent than galloping two

asked liquor what many a good mans fault mr dedalus said with a sigh they halted about the door of the mortuary chapel mr bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar poor boy was he there when the father both unconscious lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time all he might have done i owe three shillings to ogrady would he understand the mutes bore the coffin into the chapel which end is his head after a moment he followed the others in blinking in the screened light the coffin lay on its bier before the chancel four tall yellow candles at its corners always in front of us corny kelleher laying a wreath at each fore corner beckoned to the boy to kneel the mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks mr bloom stood behind near the font and when all had knelt dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it he fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and holding its brim bent over piously a server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door the whitesmocked priest came after him tidying his stole with one hand balancing with the other a little book against his toads belly wholl read the book i said the rook they halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak father coffey i knew his name was like a coffin dominenamine bully about the muzzle he looks bosses the show muscular christian woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him priest thou art peter burst sideways like a sheep in clover dedalus says he will with a belly on him like a poisoned pup most amusing expressions that man finds hhhn burst sideways non intres in judicium cum servo

priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boys bucket and shook it over the coffin then he walked to the other end and shook it again then he came back and put it back in the bucket as you were before you rested its all written down he has to do it et ne nos inducas in tentationem the server piped the answers in the treble i often thought it would be better to have boy servants up to fifteen or so after that of course holy water that was i expect shaking sleep out of it he must be fed up with that job shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up what harm if he could see what he was shaking it over every mortal day a fresh batch middleaged men old women children women dead in childbirth men with beards baldheaded businessmen consumptive girls with little sparrows breasts all the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them sleep on dignam now in paradisum said he was going to paradise or is in paradise says that over everybody tiresome kind of a job but he has to say something the priest closed his book and went off followed by the server corny kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in hoisted the coffin again carried it out and shoved it on their cart corny kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brotherinlaw all followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air mr bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket he gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left the metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres the ree the ra the ree the ra the roo lord i mustnt lilt here the oconnell circle mr dedalus said about him mr powers soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone hes at rest he said in the middle of his people old dan o but his heart is buried in rome how many broken hearts are buried here simon her grave is over there jack mr dedalus said ill soon be stretched beside her let him take me whenever he likes breaking down he began to weep to himself quietly stumbling a little in his walk mr power took his arm shes better where she is he said kindly i suppose so mr dedalus said with a weak gasp i suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven corny kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by sad occasions mr kernan began politely mr bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head the others are putting on their hats mr kernan said i suppose we can do so too we are the last this cemetery is a treacherous place they covered their heads the reverend gentleman read the service too quickly dont you think mr kernan said with reproof mr bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes secret eyes secretsearching mason i think not sure beside him again we are the last in the same boat hope hell say something else mr kernan added the service of the irish church used in mount jerome is simpler more impressive i must say mr bloom gave prudent assent the language of course was another thing mr kernan said with solemnity i am the resurrection and the life that touches a mans inmost heart it does mr bloom said your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies no touching that seat of the affections broken heart a pump after all pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day one fine day it gets bunged up and there you are lots of them lying around here lungs hearts livers old rusty pumps damn the thing else the

ned lambert said he does some canvassing for ads john henry mentons large eyes stared ahead the barrow turned into a side lane a portly man ambushed among the grasses raised his hat in homage the gravediggers touched their caps john oconnell mr power said pleased he never forgets a friend mr oconnell shook all their hands in silence mr dedalus said i am come to pay you another visit my dear simon the caretaker answered in a low voice i dont want your custom at all saluting ned lambert and john henry menton he walked on at martin cunninghams side puzzling two long keys at his back did you hear that one he asked them about mulcahy from the coombe i did not martin cunningham said they bent their silk hats in concert and hynes inclined his ear the caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles they tell the story he said that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs they asked for mulcahy from the coombe and were told where he was buried after traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough one of the drunks spelt out the name terence mulcahy the other drunk was blinking up at a statue of our saviour the widow had got put up the caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed he resumed and after blinking up at the sacred figure not a bloody bit like the man says he thats not mulcahy says he whoever done it rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with corny kelleher accepting the dockets given him turning them over and scanning them as he walked thats all done with a purpose martin cunningham explained to hynes i know hynes said i know that to cheer a fellow up martin cunningham said its pure goodheartedness damn the thing

summer just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure theres no the clay fell softer begin to be forgotten out of sight out of mind the caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat had enough of it the mourners took heart of grace one by one covering themselves without show mr bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves quietly sure of his ground he traversed the dismal fields hynes jotting down something in his notebook ah the names but he knows them all no coming to me i am just taking the names hynes said below his breath

clods rose more rose and the gravediggers rested their spades all uncovered again for a few instants the boy propped his wreath against a corner the brotherinlaw his on a lump the gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow then knocked the blades lightly on the turf clean one bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass one leaving his mates walked slowly on with shouldered weapon its blade blueglancing silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband his navelcord the brotherinlaw turning away placed something in his free hand thanks in silence

said he made a comic face and whined rubbing his knee the accumulation of the anno domini sorry mr bloom said he went to the door and holding it ajar paused j j omolloy slapped the heavy pages over

round to bachelors walk mr bloom said about this ad of keyess want to fix it up they tell me hes round there in dillons he looked indecisively for a moment at their faces the editor who leaning against the mantelshelf had propped his head on his hand suddenly stretched forth an arm amply begone he said the world is before you back in no time mr bloom said hurrying out j j omolloy took the tissues from lenehans hand and read them blowing them apart gently without comment hell get that advertisement the professor said staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind look at the young scamps after him show where lenehan cried running to the window a street cortege both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in mr blooms wake the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite a tail of white bowknots look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry lenehan said and youll kick o my rib risible taking off his flat spaugs and the walk small

locked his desk drawer hes pretty well on professor machugh said in a low voice seems to be j j omolloy said taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation but it is not always as it seems who has the most matches the calumet of peace he offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn j j omolloy opened his case again and offered it thanky vous lenehan said helping himself the editor came from the inner office a straw hat awry on his brow he declaimed in song pointing sternly at professor machugh twas rank and fame that tempted thee twas empire charmed thy heart the professor grinned locking his long lips eh you bloody old roman empire myles crawford said he took a cigarette from the open case lenehan lighting it for him with quick grace said silence for my brandnew riddle imperium romanum j j omolloy said gently it sounds nobler than british or brixton the word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire myles crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling thats it he said we are the fat you and i are the fat in the fire we havent got the chance of a snowball in hell the grandeur that was rome wait a moment professor machugh said raising two quiet claws we mustnt be led away by words by sounds of words we think of rome imperial imperious imperative he extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs pausing what was their civilisation vast i allow but vile cloacae sewers the jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said it is meet to be here let us build an altar to jehovah the roman like the englishman who follows in his footsteps brought to every new shore on which he set his foot on our shore he never set it only his cloacal obsession he gazed about him in his toga and he said it is meet to be here let us construct a watercloset which they accordingly did do lenehan said our old ancient ancestors as we read in the first chapter of guinnesss were partial to the running stream they were natures gentlemen j j omolloy murmured but we have also roman law and pontius pilate is its prophet professor machugh responded do you know that story about chief baron palles j j omolloy asked it was at the royal university dinner everything was going swimmingly first my riddle lenehan said are you ready mr omadden burke tall in copious grey of donegal

going to be trouble there one day wild geese o yes every time dont you forget that the moot point is did he forget it j j omolloy said quietly turning a horseshoe paperweight saving princes is a thank you job professor machugh turned on him and if not he said ill tell you how it was myles crawford began a hungarian it was one day lost causes noble marquess mentioned we were always loyal to lost causes the professor said success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination we were never loyal to the successful we serve them i teach the blatant latin language i speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim time is money material domination dominus lord where is the spirituality lord jesus lord salisbury a sofa in a westend club but the greek kyrie eleison a smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes lengthened his long lips the greek he said again kyrios shining word the vowels the semite and the saxon know not kyrie the radiance of the intellect i ought to profess greek the language of the mind kyrie eleison the closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit we are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of europe that foundered at trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit not an imperium that went under with the athenian fleets at aegospotami yes yes they went under pyrrhus misled by an oracle made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of greece loyal to a lost cause he strode away from them towards the window they went forth to battle mr omadden burke said greyly but they always fell boohoo lenehan wept with a little noise owing to a brick received in the latter half of the matine poor poor poor pyrrhus he whispered then near stephens ear lenehans limerick theres a ponderous pundit machugh who

the sheets into a sidepocket thatll be all right he said ill read the rest after thatll be all right lenehan extended his hands in protest but my riddle he said what opera is like a railwayline opera mr omadden burkes sphinx face reriddled lenehan announced gladly the rose of castile see the wheeze rows of cast steel gee he poked mr omadden burke mildly in the spleen mr omadden burke fell back with grace on his umbrella feigning a gasp help he sighed i feel a strong weakness lenehan rising to tiptoe fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues the professor returning by way of the files swept his hand across stephens and mr omadden burkes loose ties paris past and present he said you look like communards like fellows who had blown up the bastile j j omolloy said in quiet mockery or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of finland between you you look as though you had done the deed general bobrikoff omnium gatherum we were only thinking about it stephen said all the talents myles crawford said law the classics the turf lenehan put in literature the press if bloom were here the professor said the gentle art of advertisement and madam bloom mr omadden burke added

myles crawford said psha press and the bar where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows like whiteside like isaac butt like silvertongued ohagan eh ah bloody nonsense psha only in the

seymour bushe he would have been on the bench long ago the professor said only for but no matter j j omolloy turned to stephen and said quietly and slowly one of the most polished periods i think i ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of seymour bushe it was in that case of fratricide the childs murder case bushe defended him and in the porches of mine ear did pour by the way how did he find that out he died in his sleep or the other story beast with two backs what was that the professor asked italia magistra artium he spoke on the law of evidence j j omolloy said of roman justice as contrasted with the earlier mosaic code the lex talionis and he cited the moses of michelangelo in the vatican ha a few wellchosen words lenehan prefaced silence pause j j omolloy took out his cigarettecase false lull something quite ordinary messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar i have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act trivial in itself that striking of that match that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives a polished period j j omolloy resumed moulding his words he said of it that stony effigy in frozen music horned and terrible of the human form divine that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live deserves to live his slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall fine myles crawford said at once the divine afflatus mr omadden burke said you like it j j omolloy asked stephen stephen his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture blushed he took a cigarette from the case j j omolloy offered his case to myles crawford lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy saying muchibus thankibus a man of high morale professor magennis was speaking to me about you j j omolloy said to stephen what do you think really of that hermetic crowd the opal hush poets a e the mastermystic that blavatsky woman started it she was a nice old bag of tricks a e has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness magennis thinks you must have been pulling a es leg he is a man of the very highest morale magennis speaking about me what did he say what did he say what did he say about me dont ask no thanks professor machugh said waving the cigarettecase aside wait a moment let me say one thing the finest display of oratory i ever heard was a speech made by john f taylor at the college historical society mr justice fitzgibbon the present lord justice of appeal had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay new for those days advocating the revival of the irish tongue he turned towards myles crawford and said you know gerald fitzgibbon then you can imagine the style of his discourse he is sitting with tim healy j j omolloy said rumour has it on the trinity college estates commission he is sitting with a sweet thing myles crawford said in a childs frock go on well it was the speech mark you the professor said of a finished orator full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction i will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud mans contumely upon the new movement it was then a new movement we were weak therefore worthless he closed his long thin lips an instant but eager to be on raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims steadied them to a new focus impromptu in ferial tone he addressed j j omolloy taylor had come there you must know from a sickbed that he had prepared his speech i do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall his dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it he wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked though he was not a dying man his gaze turned at once but slowly from j j omolloys towards stephens face and then bent at once to the ground seeking his unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head soiled by his withering hair still seeking he said when fitzgibbons speech had ended john f taylor rose to reply briefly as well as i can bring them to mind his words were these he raised his head firmly his eyes bethought themselves once more witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro seeking outlet he began mr chairman ladies and gentlemen great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of ireland a moment since by my learned friend it seemed to me that i had been transported into a country far away from this country into an age remote from this age that i stood in ancient egypt and that i was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful moses his listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech and let our crooked smokes noble words coming look out could you try your hand at it yourself and it seemed to me that i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride i heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me from the fathers it was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted ah curse you thats saint augustine why will you jews not accept our culture our religion and our language you are a tribe of nomad herdsmen we are a mighty people you have no cities nor no wealth our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys trireme and quadrireme laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe you have but emerged from primitive conditions we have a literature a priesthood an agelong history and a polity nile child man effigy by the nilebank the babemaries kneel cradle of bulrushes a man supple in combat stonehorned stonebearded heart of stone you pray to a local and obscure idol our temples majestic and mysterious are the abodes of isis and osiris of horus and ammon ra yours serfdom awe and humbleness ours thunder and the seas israel is weak and few are her children egypt is an host and terrible are her arms vagrants and daylabourers are you called the world trembles at our name a dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech he lifted his voice above it boldly but ladies and gentlemen had the youthful moses listened to and accepted that view of life had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day he would never have spoken with the eternal amid lightnings on sinais mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law graven in the language of the outlaw he ceased and looked at them enjoying a silence ominousfor him j j omolloy said not without regret and yet he died without having entered the land of promise a suddenatthemomentthoughfromlingeringillnessoften previouslyexpectorateddemise lenehan added and with a great future behind him the troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase that is oratory the professor said uncontradicted gone with the wind hosts at mullaghmast and tara of the kings miles of ears of porches the tribunes words howled and scattered to the four winds a people sheltered within his voice dead noise akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was love and laud him me no more i have money gentlemen stephen said as the next motion on the agenda paper may i suggest that the house do now adjourn you take my breath away it is not perchance a french compliment mr omadden burke asked tis the hour methinks when the winejug metaphorically speaking is most grateful in ye ancient hostelry that it be and hereby is resolutely resolved all that are in favour say ay lenehan announced the contrary no i declare it carried to which particular boosing shed my casting vote is mooneys he led the way admonishing we will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters will we not yes we will not by no manner of means mr omadden burke following close said with an allys lunge of his umbrella lay on macduff chip of the old block the editor cried clapping stephen on the shoulder let us go where are those blasted keys he fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets foot and mouth i know thatll be all right thatll go in where are they thats all right he thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office let us hope j j omolloy about to follow him in said quietly to stephen i hope you will live to see it published myles one moment he went into the inner office closing the door behind him come along stephen the professor said that is fine isnt it it has the prophetic vision fuit ilium the sack of windy troy kingdoms of this world the masters of the mediterranean are fellaheen today the first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street yelling racing special dublin i have much much to learn they turned to the left along abbey street i have a vision too stephen said yes the professor said skipping to get into step crawford will follow another newsboy shot past them yelling as he ran racing special dear dirty dublin dubliners two dublin vestals stephen said elderly and pious have lived fifty and fiftythree years in fumballys lane where is that the professor asked off blackpitts stephen said damp night reeking of

the top of nelsons pillar they save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox they shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers they put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain wise virgins professor machugh said life on the raw they buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in marlborough street from miss kate collins proprietress they purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of nelsons pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn they give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase grunting encouraging each other afraid of the dark panting one asking the other have you the brawn praising god and the blessed virgin threatening to come down peeping at the airslits glory be to god they had no idea it was that high their names are anne kearns and florence maccabe anne kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on lourdes water given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father florence maccabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double x for supper every saturday antithesis the professor said nodding twice vestal virgins i can see them whats keeping our friend he turned a bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps scattering in all directions yelling their white papers fluttering hard after them myles crawford appeared on the steps his hat aureoling his scarlet face talking with j j omolloy come along the professor cried waving his arm he set off again to walk by stephens side return of bloom yes he said i see them mr bloom breathless caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the irish catholic and dublin penny journal called mr crawford a moment telegraph racing special what is it myles crawford said falling back a pace a newsboy

hoop myself i was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week sorry jack you must take the will for the deed with a heart and a half if i could raise the wind anyhow j j omolloy pulled a long face and walked on silently they caught up on the others and walked abreast when they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings something for you the professor explained to myles crawford two old dublin women on the top of nelsons pillar some columnthats what waddler one said thats new myles crawford said thats copy out for the waxies dargle two old trickies what but they are afraid the pillar will fall stephen went on they see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are

of plums between them and eat the plums out of it one after another wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings he gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close lenehan and mr omadden burke hearing turned beckoned and led on across towards mooneys finished myles crawford said so long as they do no worse sophist wallops haughty helen square on proboscis spartans gnash molars ithacans vow pen is champ you remind me of antisthenes the professor said a disciple of gorgias the sophist it is said of

loyola make haste to help me the play begins a player comes on under the shadow made up in the castoff mail of a court buck a wellset man with a bass voice it is the ghost the king a king and no king and the player is shakespeare who has studied hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre he speaks the words to burbage the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth calling him by a name hamlet i am thy fathers spirit bidding him list to a son he speaks the son of his soul the prince young hamlet and to the son of his body hamnet shakespeare who has died in stratford that his namesake may live for ever is it possible that that player shakespeare a ghost by absence and in the vesture of buried denmark a ghost by death speaking his own words to his own sons name had hamnet shakespeare lived he would have been prince hamlets twin is it possible i want to know or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises you are the dispossessed son i am the murdered father your mother is the guilty queen ann shakespeare born hathaway but this prying into the family life of a great man russell began impatiently art thou there truepenny interesting only to the parish clerk i mean we have the plays i mean when we read the poetry of king lear what is it to us how the poet lived as for

voice asked her ghost at least has been laid for ever she died for literature at least before she was born she died stephen retorted sixtyseven years after she was born she saw him into and out of the world she took his first embraces she bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed mothers deathbed candle the sheeted mirror who brought me into this world lies there bronzelidded under few cheap flowers liliata rutilantium i wept alone john eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp the world believes that shakespeare made a mistake he said and got out of it as quickly and as best he could bosh stephen said rudely a man of genius makes no mistakes his errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian softcreakfooted bald eared and assiduous a shrew john eglinton said shrewdly is not a useful portal of discovery one should imagine what useful discovery did socrates learn from xanthippe dialectic stephen answered and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world what he learnt from his other wife myrto absit nomen socratididions epipsychidion no man not a woman will ever know but neither the midwifes lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of sinn fein and their naggin of hemlock but ann hathaway mr bests quiet voice said forgetfully yes we seem to be forgetting her as shakespeare himself forgot her his look went from brooders beard to carpers skull to remind to chide them not unkindly then to the baldpink lollard costard guiltless though maligned he had a good groatsworth of wit stephen said and no truant memory he carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to romeville whistling the girl i left

bedchamber of every lightoflove in london is katharine the shrew illfavoured hortensio calls her young and beautiful do you think the writer of antony and cleopatra a passionate pilgrim had his eyes

together a sheaf of our younger poets verses we are all looking forward anxiously anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces lighted shone see this remember stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen hung on his ashplanthandle over his knee my casque and sword touch lightly with two index fingers aristotles experiment one or two necessity is that in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise argal one hat is one hat listen young colum and starkey george roberts is doing the commercial part longworth will give it a good puff in the express o will he i

malachi mulligan is coming too moore asked him to bring haines did you hear miss mitchells joke about moore and martyn that moore is martyns wild oats awfully clever isnt it they remind one of don

correspondence i understand stephen said thanks god ild you the pigs paper bullockbefriending synge has promised me an article for dana too are we going to be read i feel we are the gaelic league wants something in irish i hope you will come round tonight bring starkey stephen sat down the quaker librarian came from the leavetakers blushing his mask said mr dedalus your views are most illuminating he creaked to and fro tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine and covered by the noise of outgoing said low is it your view then that she was not faithful to the poet alarmed face asks me why did he come courtesy or an inward light where there is a reconciliation stephen said there must have been first a sundering yes christfox in leather trews hiding a runaway in blighted treeforks from hue and cry knowing no vixen walking lonely in the chase women he won to him tender people a whore of babylon ladies of justices bully tapsters wives fox and geese and in new place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely once as sweet as fresh as cinnamon now her leaves falling all bare frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven yes so you think the door closed behind the outgoer rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell rest of warm and brooding air a vestals lamp here he ponders things that were not what caesar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer what might have been possibilities of the possible as possible things not known what name achilles bore when he lived among women coffined thoughts around me in mummycases embalmed in spice of words thoth god of libraries a birdgod moonycrowned and i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest in painted chambers loaded with tilebooks they are still once quick in the brains of men still but an itch of death is in them to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale urge me to wreak their will certainly john eglinton mused of all great men he is the most enigmatic we know nothing but that he lived and suffered not even so much others abide our question a shadow hangs over all the rest but hamlet is so personal isnt it mr best pleaded i mean a kind of private paper dont you know of his private life i mean i dont care a button dont you know who is killed or who is guilty he rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk smiling his defiance his private papers in the original ta an bad ar an tir taim in mo shagart put beurla on it littlejohn quoth littlejohn eglinton i was prepared for paradoxes from what malachi mulligan told us but i may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that shakespeare is hamlet you have a stern task before you bear with me stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows a basilisk e quando vede luomo lattosca messer brunetto i thank thee for the word as we or mother dana weave and unweave our bodies stephen said from day to day their molecules shuttled to and fro so does the artist weave and unweave his image and as the mole on my right breast is where it was when i was born though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth in the intense instant of imagination when the mind shelley says is a fading coal that which i was is that which i am and that which in possibility i may come to be so in the future the sister of the past i may see myself as i sit here now but by reflection from that which then i shall be drummond of hawthornden helped you at that stile yes mr best said youngly i feel hamlet quite young the bitterness might be from the father but the passages with ophelia are surely from the son has the wrong sow by the lug he is in my father i am in his son that mole is the last to go stephen said laughing john eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow if that were the birthmark of genius he said genius would be a drug in the market the plays of shakespeares later years which renan admired so much breathe another spirit the spirit of reconciliation the quaker librarian breathed there can be no reconciliation stephen said if there has not been a sundering said that if you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of king lear othello hamlet troilus and cressida look to see when and how the shadow lifts what softens the heart of a man shipwrecked in storms dire tried like another ulysses pericles prince of tyre head redconecapped buffeted brineblinded a child a girl placed in his arms marina the leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity john eglinton detected the highroads are dreary but they lead to the town good bacon gone musty shakespeare bacons wild oats cypherjugglers going the highroads seekers on the great quest what town good masters mummed in names a e eon magee john eglinton east of the sun west of the moon tir na nog booted the twain and staved how many miles to dublin three score and ten sir will we be there by candlelight mr brandes accepts it stephen said as the first play of the closing period does he what does mr sidney lee or mr simon lazarus as some aver his name is say of it marina stephen said a child of storm miranda a wonder perdita that which was lost what was lost is given back to him his daughters child my dearest wife pericles says was like this maid will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother the art of being a grandfather mr best gan murmur lart dtre grand will he not see reborn in her with the memory of his own youth added another image do you know what you are talking about love yes word known to all men amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus his own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of all experience material and moral such an appeal will touch him the images of other males of his blood will repel him he will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself the benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope i hope mr dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public and we ought to mention another irish commentator mr george bernard shaw nor should we forget mr frank harris his articles on shakespeare in the saturday review were surely brilliant oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets the favoured rival is william herbert earl of pembroke i own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony withwhat shall i sayour notions of what ought not to have been felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them auks egg prize of their fray he thous and thees her with grave husbandwords dost love miriam dost love thy man that may be too stephen said theres a saying of goethes which mr magee likes to quote beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life why does he send to one who is a buonaroba a bay where all men ride a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood a lordling to woo for him he was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written romeo and juliet why belief in himself has been untimely killed he was overborne in a cornfield first ryefield i should say and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down assumed dongiovannism will not save him no later undoing will undo the first undoing the tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding if the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her womans invisible weapon there is i feel in the words some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion a darker shadow of the first darkening even his own understanding of himself a like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool they list and in the porches of their ears i pour the soul has been before stricken mortally a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear but those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come the poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it king hamlets ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator that is why the speech his lean unlovely english is always turned elsewhere backward ravisher and ravished what he would but would not go with him from lucreces bluecircled ivory globes to imogens breast bare with its mole cinquespotted he goes back weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself an old dog licking an old sore but because loss is his gain he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed his beaver is up he is a ghost a shadow now the wind by elsinores rocks or what you will the seas voice a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow the son consubstantial with the father amen was responded from the doorway hast thou found me o mine enemy entracte a ribald face sullen as a deans buck mulligan came forward then blithe in motley towards the greeting of their smiles my telegram you were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate if i mistake not he asked of stephen primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed panama as with a bauble they make him welcome was du verlachst wirst du noch dienen brood of mockers photius pseudomalachi johann most he who

dead when all the quick shall be dead already glooria in excelsis deo he lifts his hands veils fall o flowers bells with bells with bells aquiring yes indeed the quaker librarian said a most instructive discussion mr mulligan ill be bound has his theory too of the play and of shakespeare all sides of life should be represented he smiled on all sides equally buck mulligan thought puzzled shakespeare he said i seem to know the name a flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features to be sure he said remembering brightly the chap that writes like synge mr best turned to him haines missed you he said did you meet him hell see you after at the d b c hes gone to gills to buy hydes lovesongs of connacht i came through the museum buck mulligan said was he here the bards fellowcountrymen john eglinton answered are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising i hear that an actress played hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in dublin vining held that the prince was a woman has noone made him out to be an irishman judge barton i believe is searching for some clues he swears his highness not his lordship by saint patrick the most brilliant of all is that story of wildes mr best said lifting his brilliant notebook that portrait of mr w h where he proves that the sonnets were written by a willie hughes a man all hues for willie hughes is it not the quaker librarian asked or hughie wills mr william himself w h who am i i mean for willie hughes mr best said amending his gloss easily of course its all paradox dont you know hughes and hews and hues the colour but its so typical the way he works it out its the very essence of wilde dont you know the light touch his glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled a blond ephebe tame essence of wilde youre darned witty three drams of usquebaugh you drank with dan deasys ducats how much did i spend o a few shillings for a plump of pressmen humour wet and dry wit you would give your five wits

coils her fang ins kiss do you think it is only a paradox the quaker librarian was asking the mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious they talked seriously of mockers seriousness buck mulligans again heavy face eyed stephen awhile then his head wagging he came near drew a folded telegram from his pocket his mobile lips read smiling with new delight telegram he said wonderful inspiration telegram a papal bull he sat on a corner of the unlit desk reading aloud joyfully the sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done signed dedalus where did you launch it from the kips no college green have you drunk the four quid the aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father telegram malachi mulligan the ship lower abbey street o you peerless mummer o you priestified kinchite joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue its what im telling you mister honey its queer and sick we were haines and myself the time himself brought it in twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar im thinking and he limp with leching and we one hour and two hours and three hours in

in glasthule hes out in pampooties to murder you me stephen exclaimed that was your contribution to literature buck mulligan gleefully bent back laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling murder you

over in the museum where i went to hail the foamborn aphrodite the greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer every day we must do homage to her life of life thy lips enkindle suddenly he turned to stephen he knows you he knows your old fellow o i fear me he is greeker than the greeks his pale galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove venus kallipyge o the thunder of those loins the god pursuing the maiden hid we want to hear more john eglinton decided with mr bests approval we begin to be interested in mrs s till now we had thought of her if at all as a patient griselda a penelope stayathome antisthenes pupil of gorgias stephen said took the palm of beauty from kyrios menelaus brooddam argive helen the wooden mare of troy in whom a score of heroes slept and handed it to poor penelope twenty years he lived in london and during part of that time he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of ireland his life was rich his art more than the art of feudalism

its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures you know manninghams story of the burghers wife who bade dick burbage to her bed after she had seen him in richard iii and how

twenty years what do you suppose poor penelope in stratford was doing behind the diamond panes do and do thing done in a rosery of fetter lane of gerard herbalist he walks greyedauburn an azured harebell like her veins lids of junos eyes violets he walks one life is all one body do but do afar in a reek of lust and squalor hands are laid on whiteness buck mulligan rapped john eglintons desk sharply whom do you suspect he challenged say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets once spurned twice spurned but the court wanton spurned him for a lord his dearmylove love that dare not speak its name as an englishman you mean john sturdy eglinton put in he loved a lord old wall where sudden lizards flash at charenton i watched them it seems so stephen said when he wants to do for him and for all other and singular uneared wombs the holy office an ostler does for the stallion maybe like socrates he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife but she the giglot wanton did not break a bedvow two deeds are rank in that ghosts mind a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined deceased husbands brother sweet ann i take it was hot in the blood once a wooer twice a wooer stephen turned boldly in his chair the burden of proof is with you not with me he said frowning if you deny that in the fifth scene of hamlet he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him all those women saw their men down and under mary her goodman john ann her poor dear willun when he went and died on her raging that he was the first to go joan her four brothers judith her husband and all her sons susan her husband too while susans daughter elizabeth to use granddaddys words wed her second having killed her first o yes mention there is in the years when he was living richly in royal london to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her fathers shepherd explain you then explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity he faced their silence to whom thus eglinton you mean the will but that has been explained i believe by jurists she was entitled to her widows dower at common law his legal knowledge was great our judges tell us him satan fleers mocker and therefore he left out her name from the first draft but he did not leave out the presents for his granddaughter for his daughters for his sister for his old cronies in stratford and in london and therefore when he was urged as i believe to name her he left her his secondbest bed punkt leftherhis secondbest leftherhis bestabed secabest leftabed woa pretty countryfolk had few chattels then john eglinton observed as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type he was a rich country gentleman stephen said with a coat of arms and landed estate at stratford and a house in ireland yard a capitalist shareholder a bill promoter a tithefarmer why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace it is clear that there were two beds a best and a secondbest mr secondbest best said finely separatio a mensa et a thalamo bettered buck mulligan and was smiled on antiquity mentions famous beds second eglinton puckered bedsmiling let me think antiquity mentions that stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage stephen said who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves pays tribute to his elders wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress dont forget nell gwynn herpyllis and let her live in his villa do you mean he died so mr best asked with slight concern i mean he died dead drunk buck mulligan capped a quart of ale is a dish for a king o i must tell you what dowden said what asked besteglinton william shakespeare and company limited the peoples william for terms apply e dowden highfield house lovely buck mulligan suspired amorously i asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard he lifted his hands and said all we can say is that life ran very high in those days lovely catamite the sense of beauty leads us astray said beautifulinsadness best to ugling eglinton steadfast john replied severe the doctor can tell us what those words mean you cannot eat your cake and have it sayest thou so will they wrest from us from me the palm of beauty and the sense of property stephen said he drew shylock out of his own long pocket the son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots his borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by chettle falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing he sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent how else could aubreys ostler and callboy get rich quick all events

and curious way to an avarice of the emotions he means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who it may be hungers for it jews whom christians tax with avarice are of all races the most given to intermarriage accusations are made in anger the christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews for whom as for the lollards storm was shelter bound

philosophised for poor ann wills widow is the will to die requiescat stephen prayed what of all the will to do it has vanished long ago she lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed the mobled queen even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes in old age she takes up with gospellers one stayed with her at new place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask and heard she had a soul she read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring

daughters with thirtyfive years of life nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita with fifty of experience is the beardless undergraduate from wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother

meredith que voulezvous moore would say he puts bohemia on the seacoast and makes ulysses quote aristotle why stephen answered himself because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to shakespeare what the poor are not always with him the note of banishment banishment from the heart banishment from home sounds uninterruptedly from the two gentlemen

mulberrytree in the earth then dies the motion is ended gravediggers bury hamlet pre and hamlet fils a king and a prince at last in death with incidental music and what though murdered and betrayed

what was that boys name again dignam yes vere dignum et iustum est brother swan was the person to see mr cunninghams letter yes oblige him if possible good practical catholic useful at mission time a onelegged sailor swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches growled some notes he jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend john conmee s j father conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held he knew one silver crown father conmee crossed to mountjoy square he thought but not for long of soldiers and sailors whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs ending their days in some pauper ward and of cardinal wolseys words if i had served my god as i have served my king he would not have abandoned me in my old days he walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves and towards him came the wife of mr david sheehy mp very well indeed father and you father father conmee was wonderfully well indeed he would go to buxton probably for the waters and her boys were they getting on well at belvedere was that so father conmee was very glad indeed to hear that and mr sheehy himself still in london the house was still sitting to be sure it was beautiful weather it was delightful indeed yes it was very probable that father bernard vaughan would come again to preach o yes a very great success a wonderful man really father conmee was very glad to see the wife of mr david sheehy mp iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to mr david sheehy mp yes he would certainly call good afternoon mrs sheehy father conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled as he took leave at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun and smiled yet again in going he had cleaned his teeth he knew with arecanut paste father conmee walked and walking smiled for he thought on father bernard vaughans droll eyes and cockney voice pilate wy dont you old back that owlin mob a zealous man however really he was and really did great good in his way beyond a doubt he loved ireland he said and he loved the irish of good family too would one think it welsh were they not o lest he forget that letter to father provincial father conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of mountjoy square yes they were from belvedere the little house aha and were they good boys at school o that was very good now and what was his name jack sohan and his name ger gallaher and the other little man his name was brunny lynam o that was a very nice name to have father conmee gave a letter from his breast to master brunny lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of fitzgibbon street but mind you dont post yourself into the box little man he said the boys sixeyed father conmee and laughed o sir well let me see if you can post a letter father conmee said master brunny lynam ran across the road and put father conmees letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox father conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along mountjoy square east mr denis j maginni professor of dancing c in silk hat slate frockcoat with silk facings white kerchief tie tight lavender trousers canary gloves and pointed patent boots walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady maxwell at the corner of dignams court was that not mrs mguinness mrs mguinness stately silverhaired bowed to father conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed and father conmee smiled and saluted how did she do a fine carriage she had like mary queen of scots something and to think that she was a pawnbroker well now such a what should he say such a queenly mien father conmee walked down great charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left the reverend t r greene ba will dv speak the incumbent they called him he felt it incumbent on him to say a few words but one should be charitable invincible ignorance they acted according to their lights father conmee turned the corner and walked along the north circular road it was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare surely there ought to be a band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from richmond street all raised untidy caps father conmee greeted them more than once benignly christian brother boys father conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked saint josephs church portland row for aged and virtuous females father conmee raised his hat to the blessed sacrament virtuous but occasionally they were also badtempered near aldborough house father conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman and now it was an office or something father conmee began to walk along the north strand road and was saluted by mr william gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop father conmee saluted mr william gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter he passed grogans the tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in new york in america those things were continually happening unfortunate people to die like that unprepared still an act of perfect contrition father conmee went by daniel bergins publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged they saluted him and were saluted father conmee passed h j oneills funeral establishment where corny kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay a constable on his beat saluted father conmee and father conmee saluted the constable in youkstetters the porkbutchers father conmee observed pigs puddings white and black and red lie neatly curled in tubes moored under the trees of charleville mall father conmee saw a turfbarge a towhorse with pendent head a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him it was idyllic and father conmee reflected on the providence of the creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people on newcomen bridge the very reverend john conmee sj of saint francis xaviers church upper gardiner street stepped on to an outward bound tram off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend nicholas dudley c c of saint agathas church north william street on to newcomen bridge at newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island father conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove while four shillings a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket the solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to father conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap father conmee liked cheerful decorum it was a peaceful day the gentleman with the glasses opposite father conmee had finished explaining and looked down his wife father conmee supposed a tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses she raised her small gloved fist yawned ever so gently tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily sweetly father conmee perceived her perfume in the car he perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat father conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head at annesley bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight the conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her she passed out with her basket and a marketnet and father conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down and father conmee thought that as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you my child that they have been absolved pray for me but they had so many worries in life so many cares poor creatures from the hoardings mr eugene stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at father conmee father conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint peter claver sj and the african mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night that book by the belgian jesuit le nombre des lus seemed to father conmee a reasonable plea those were millions of human souls created by god in his own likeness to whom the faith had not dv been brought but they were gods souls created by god it seemed to father conmee a pity that they should all be lost a waste if one might say at the howth road stop father conmee alighted was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn the malahide road was quiet it pleased father conmee road and name the joybells were ringing in gay malahide lord talbot de malahide immediate hereditary lord admiral of malahide and the seas adjoining then came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one day those were old worldish days loyal times in joyous townlands old times in the barony father conmee walking thought of his little book old times in the barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of mary rochfort daughter of lord molesworth first countess of belvedere a listless lady no more young walked alone the shore of lough ennel mary first countess of belvedere listlessly walking in the evening not startled when an otter plunged who could know the truth not the jealous lord belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris with her husbands brother she would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did only god knew and she and he her husbands brother father conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence needed however for mans race on earth and of the ways of god which were not our ways don john conmee walked and moved in times of yore he was humane and honoured there he bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom ceiled with full fruit clusters and the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom noble to noble were impalmed by don john conmee it was a charming day the lychgate of a field showed father conmee breadths of cabbages curtseying to him with ample underleaves the sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind moutonner the french said a just and homely word father conmee reading his office watched a flock of muttoning clouds over rathcoffey his thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of clongowes field he walked there reading in the evening and heard the cries of the boys lines at their play young cries in the quiet evening he was their rector his reign was mild father conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out an ivory bookmark told him the page nones he should have read that before lunch but lady maxwell had come father conmee read in secret pater and ave and crossed his breast deus in adiutorium he walked calmly and read mutely the nones walking and reading till he came to res in beati immaculati principium verborum tuorum veritas in eternum omnia indicia iustitiae tuae a flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand the young man raised his cap abruptly the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig father conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary sin principes persecuti sunt me gratis et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum corny kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner he pulled himself erect went to it and spinning it on its axle viewed its shape and brass furnishings chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway there he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase looking idly out father john conmee stepped into the dollymount tram on newcomen bridge corny kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed his hat downtilted chewing his blade of hay constable 57c on his beat stood to pass the time of day thats a fine day mr kelleher ay corny kelleher said its very close the constable said corny kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in eccles street flung forth a coin whats the best news he asked i seen that particular party last evening the constable said with bated breath a onelegged sailor crutched himself round macconnells corner skirting rabaiottis icecream car and jerked himself up eccles street towards larry orourke in shirtsleeves in his doorway he growled unamiably for england he swung himself violently forward past katey and boody dedalus halted and growled home and beauty j j omolloys white careworn face was told that mr lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor a stout lady stopped took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her the sailor grumbled thanks glanced sourly at the unheeding windows sank his head and swung himself forward four strides he halted and growled angrily for england two barefoot urchins sucking long liquorice laces halted near him gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths he swung himself forward in vigorous jerks halted lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply home and beauty the gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two ceased the blind of the window was drawn aside a card unfurnished apartments slipped from the sash and fell a plump bare generous arm shone was seen held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps a womans hand flung forth a coin over the area railings it fell on the path one of the urchins ran to it picked it up and dropped it into the minstrels cap saying there sir katey and boody dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen did you put in the books boody asked maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow they wouldnt give anything on them she said father conmee walked through clongowes

gurnard the plaice the roach the halibut the gibbed haddock the grilse the dab the brill the flounder the pollock the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated in the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage the wafty sycamore the lebanonian cedar the exalted planetree the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots silvery fishes crans of herrings drafts of eels codlings creels of fingerlings purple seagems and playful insects and heroes voyage from afar to woo them from eblana to slievemargy the peerless princes of unfettered munster and of connacht the just and of smooth sleek leinster and of cruahans land and of armagh the splendid and of the noble district of boyle princes the sons of kings and there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for oconnell fitzsimon takes toll of them a chieftain descended from chieftains thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields flaskets of cauliflowers floats of spinach pineapple chunks rangoon beans strikes of tomatoes drums of figs drills of swedes spherical potatoes and

geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and cuffes prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves and there is ever heard a trampling cackling roaring lowing bleating bellowing rumbling grunting champing chewing of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of lusk and rush and carrickmines and from the streamy vales of thomond from the mgillicuddys reeks the inaccessible and lordly shannon the unfathomable and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of kiar their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmers firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds various in size the agate with this dun so we turned into barney kiernans and there sure enough was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel garryowen and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink there he is says i in his gloryhole with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers working for the cause the bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps be a corporal work of mercy if someone

deliver says he thats all right citizen says joe friends here pass friends says he then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he whats your opinion of the times doing the rapparee and rory of the hill but begob joe was equal to the occasion i think the markets are on a rise says he sliding his hand down his fork so begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says foreign wars is the cause of

citizen says joe wine of the country says he whats yours says joe ditto macanaspey says i three pints terry says joe and hows the old heart citizen says he never better a chara says he what garry are we going to win eh and with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and by jesus he near throttled him the figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero from shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse ulex europeus the widewinged nostrils from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest the eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower a powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble he wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes beneath this he wore trews of deerskin roughly stitched with gut his nether extremities were encased in high balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast from his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many irish heroes and heroines of antiquity cuchulin conn of hundred battles niall of nine hostages brian of kincora the

fairest of her race little alf bergan popped in round the door and hid behind barneys snug squeezed up with the laughing and who was sitting up there in the corner that i hadnt seen snoring drunk blind to the world only bob doran i didnt know what was up and alf kept making signs out of the door and begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon denis breen in his bathslippers with two

doran is that bergan hurry up terry boy says alf terence oryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers bungiveagh and bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats cunning as the sons of deathless leda for they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil those cunning brothers lords of the vat then did you chivalrous terence hand forth as to the manner born that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted the soul of chivalry in beauty akin to the immortals but he the young chief of the obergans could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port scion of the house of brunswick victoria her name her most excellent majesty by grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and of the british dominions beyond the sea queen defender of the faith empress of india even she

christ says alf begob he was what you might call flabbergasted in the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels in reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana alavatar hatakalda wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that mars and jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power it was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was we greet you friends of earth who are still in the body mind c k doesnt pile it on it was ascertained that the reference was to mr cornelius kelleher manager of messrs h j oneills popular funeral establishment a personal friend of the defunct who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to cullens to be soled only as the heels were still good he stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction he is gone from mortal haunts odignam sun of our morning fleet was his foot on the bracken patrick of the beamy brow wail banba with your wind and wail o ocean with your whirlwind there he is again says the citizen staring out who says i bloom says he hes on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes and begob i saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again little alf was knocked bawways faith he was good christ says he i could have sworn it was him and says bob doran with the hat on the back of his poll lowest blackguard in dublin when hes under the influence who said christ is good i beg your parsnips says alf is that a good christ says bob doran to take away poor little willy dignam ah well says alf trying to pass it off hes over all his troubles but bob doran shouts out of him hes a bloody ruffian i say to take away poor little willy dignam terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet that they didnt want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises and bob doran starts doing the weeps about paddy dignam true as youre there the finest man says he snivelling the finest purest character the tear is bloody near your eye talking through his bloody hat fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married mooney the bumbailiffs daughter mother kept a kip in hardwicke street that used to be stravaging about the landings bantam lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her exposing her person open to all comers fair field and no favour the noblest the truest says he and hes gone poor little willy poor little paddy dignam and mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven old garryowen started growling again at bloom that was skeezing round the door come in come on he wont eat you says the citizen so bloom slopes in with his cods eye on the dog and he asks terry was martin cunningham there o christ mkeown says joe reading one of the letters listen to this will you and he starts reading out one 7 hunter street liverpool to the high sheriff of dublin dublin honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged joe gann in bootle jail on the 12 of febuary 1900 and i hanged show us joe says i private arthur chace for fowl murder of jessie tilsit in pentonville prison and i was assistant when jesus says i billington executed the awful murderer toad smith the citizen made a grab at the letter hold hard says joe i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he cant get out hoping to be favoured i remain honoured sir my terms is five ginnees h rumbold master barber and a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too says the citizen and the dirty scrawl of the wretch says joe here says he take them to hell out of my sight alf hello bloom says he what will you have so they started arguing about the point bloom saying he wouldnt and he couldnt and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well hed just take a cigar gob hes a prudent member and no mistake give us one of your prime stinkers terry says joe and alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it theyre all barbers says he from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses and he was telling us theres two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull in the dark land they bide the vengeful knights of the razor their deadly coil they grasp yea and therein they lead to erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for i will on nowise suffer it even so saith the lord so they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time im told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about i dont know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on theres one thing it hasnt a deterrent effect on says alf whats that says joe the poor buggers tool thats being hanged says alf that so says joe gods truth says alf i heard that from the head warder that was in kilmainham when they hanged joe brady the invincible he told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker ruling passion strong in death says joe as someone said that can be explained by science says bloom its only a natural phenomenon dont you see because on account of the and then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would according to the best approved tradition of medical science be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new ireland and new this that and the other talking about new ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs and round he goes to bob doran that was standing alf a half one sucking up for what he could get so of course bob doran starts doing the bloody fool with him give us the paw give the paw doggy good old doggy give the paw here give us the paw arrah bloody end to the paw hed paw and alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred

precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance the deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle a torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons a posse of dublin metropolitan police superintended by the chief commissioner in

endeared to us from the cradle by speranzas plaintive muse special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents considerable amusement was caused by the favourite dublin streetsingers lnhn and mllgn who sang the night before larry was stretched in their usual mirthprovoking fashion our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies the children of the male and female foundling hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the days entertainment and a word of praise is due to the little sisters of the poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat the viceregal houseparty which

rashers and eggs fried steak and onions done to a nicety delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he with an abnegation rare in these our times rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish immediately acceded to that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers association as a token of his regard and esteem the nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake the hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly sheila my own encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach she swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in clonturk park she brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of anna liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and oblivious of the dreadful present they both laughed heartily all the spectators including the venerable pastor joining in the general merriment that monster audience simply rocked with delight but anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time a fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people touched to the inmost core broke into heartrending sobs not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself big strong men officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal irish constabulary were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage a most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young oxford graduate noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex stepped forward and presenting his visiting card bankbook and genealogical tree solicited the hand of the hapless young lady requesting her to name the day and was accepted on the spot every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion and when the gallant young oxonian the bearer by the way of one of the most timehonoured names in albions history placed on the finger of his blushing fiance an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds nay even the ster provostmarshal lieutenantcolonel tomkinmaxwell ffrenchmullan tomlinson who presided on the sad occasion he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching could not now restrain his natural emotion with his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone god blimey if she aint a clinker that there bleeding tart blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry straight it does when i sees her cause i thinks of my old mashtub whats waiting for me down limehouse way so then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that cant speak their own language and joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of joe and talking about the gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink the curse of ireland antitreating is about the size of it gob hed let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the lord would call him before youd ever see the froth of his pint and one night i went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my maureen lay and there was a fellow with a ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns gob flahoolagh entertainment dont be talking ireland sober is ireland free and then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of and one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females hitting below the belt so howandever as i was saying the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by joe and me id train him by kindness so i would if he was my dog give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldnt blind him afraid hell bite you says the citizen jeering no says i but he might take my leg for a lamppost so he calls the old dog over whats on you garry says he then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in irish and the old towser growling letting on to answer like a duet in the opera such growling you never heard as they let off between them someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws all those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals and their name is legion should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances owen garry the exhibition which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system comprises among other achievements the recitation of verse our greatest living phonetic expert wild horses shall not drag it from us has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance the italics are ours to the ranns of ancient celtic bards we are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the little sweet branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather as a contributor d o c points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous raftery and of donal macconsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye we subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into english by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication the metrical system of the canine original which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the welsh englyn is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if owens verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour the curse of my curses seven days every day and seven dry thursdays on you barney kiernan has no sup of water to cool my courage and my guts red roaring after lowrys lights so he told terry to bring some water for the dog and gob you could hear him lapping it up a mile off and joe asked him would he have another i will says he a chara to show theres no ill feeling gob hes not as green as hes cabbagelooking arsing around from one pub to another leaving it to your own honour with old giltraps dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators entertainment for man and beast and says joe could you make a hole in another pint could a swim duck says i same again terry says joe are you sure you wont have anything in the way of liquid refreshment says he thank you no says bloom as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet martin cunningham dont you see about this insurance of poor dignams martin asked me to go to the house you see he dignam i mean didnt serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee cant recover on the policy holy wars says joe laughing thats a good one if old shylock is landed so the wife comes out top dog what well thats a point says bloom for the wifes admirers whose admirers says joe the wifes advisers i mean says bloom then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that dignam owed bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagees right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act he was bloody safe he wasnt run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal hungarian privileged lottery true as youre there o commend me to an israelite royal and privileged hungarian robbery so bob doran comes lurching around asking bloom to tell mrs dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer a finer than poor little willy thats dead to tell her choking with bloody foolery and shaking blooms hand doing the tragic to tell her that shake hands brother youre a rogue and im another let me said he so far presume upon our acquaintance which however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time is founded as i hope and believe on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour but should i have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness no rejoined the other i appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and i shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that though the errand be one of sorrow this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup then suffer me to take your hand said he the goodness of your heart i feel sure will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy were i to give vent to my feelings would deprive me even of speech and off with him and out trying to walk straight boosed at five oclock night he was near being lagged only paddy leonard knew the bobby 14a blind to the world up in a shebeen in bride street after closing time fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard drinking porter out of teacups and calling himself a frenchy

hugging and smugging and the two shawls killed with the laughing picking his pockets the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another how is your testament have you got an old testament only paddy was passing there i tell you what then see him of a sunday with his little concubine of a wife and she wagging her tail up the aisle of

exercise was bad i declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to bloom look at bloom do you see that straw thats a straw declare to my aunt hed talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady a most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of brian ociarnains in sraid na bretaine bheag under the auspices of sluagh na heireann on the revival of ancient gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture as understood in ancient greece and ancient rome and ancient ireland for the development of the race the venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions after an instructive discourse by the chairman a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient panceltic forefathers the wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue mr joseph mcarthy hynes made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient gaelic sports and pastimes practised morning and evening by finn maccool as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages l bloom who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal thomas osborne davis evergreen verses happily too familiar to need recalling here a nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself the irish carusogaribaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it his superb highclass vocalism which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions the proceedings then terminated amongst the clergy present were

hefty battle when myler and percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns handicapped as he was by lack of poundage dublins pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft the final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions the welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pets nose and myler came on looking groggy the soldier got to business leading off with a powerful left jab to which the irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of bennetts jaw the redcoat ducked but the dubliner lifted him with a left hook the body punch being a fine one the men came to handigrips myler quickly became busy and got his man under the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes myler punishing him the englishman whose right eye was nearly closed took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck confident of knocking out the fistic eblanite in jigtime it was a fight to a finish and the best man for it the two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high the referee twice cautioned pucking percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch after a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponents mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to battling bennetts stomach flooring him flat it was a knockout clean and clever amid tense expectation the portobello bruiser was being counted out when bennetts second ole pfotts wettstein threw in the towel and the santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight he knows which side his bread is buttered says alf i hear hes

them god and kiss the book and they rose in their seats those twelve of iar and they swore by the name of him who is from everlasting that they would do his rightwiseness and straightway the minions

john wyse and a hands up terry are you asleep yes sir says terry small whisky and bottle of allsop right sir hanging over the bloody paper with alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public picture of a butting match trying to crack their bloody skulls one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate and another one black beast burned in omaha ga a lot of deadwood dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him gob they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job but what about the fighting navy says ned that keeps our foes at bay ill tell you what about it says the citizen hell upon earth it is read the revelations thats going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at portsmouth a fellow writes that calls himself disgusted one so he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out howling for his ma and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun a rump and dozen says the citizen was what that old ruffian sir john beresford called it but the modern gods englishman calls it caning on the breech and says john wyse tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder thats your glorious british navy says the citizen that bosses the earth the fellows that never will be slaves with the only hereditary chamber on the face of gods earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons thats the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs on which the sun never rises says joe and the tragedy of it is says the citizen they believe it the unfortunate yahoos believe it they believe in rod the scourger almighty creator of hell upon earth and in jacky tar the son of a gun who was conceived of unholy boast born of the fighting navy suffered under rump and dozen was scarified flayed and curried yelled like bloody hell the third day he arose again from the bed steered into haven sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid but says bloom isnt discipline the same everywhere i mean wouldnt it be the same here if you put force against force didnt i tell you as true as im drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp hed try to downface you that dying was living well put force against force says the citizen we have our greater ireland beyond the sea they were driven out of house and home in the black 47 their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered saxons there would soon be as few irish in ireland as redskins in america even the grand turk sent us his piastres but the sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the british hyenas bought and sold in rio de janeiro ay they drove out the peasants in hordes twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships but those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage and they will come again and with a vengeance no cravens the sons of granuaile the champions of kathleen ni houlihan perfectly true says bloom but my point was we are a long time waiting for that day citizen says ned since the poor old woman told us that the french were on the sea and landed at killala ay says john wyse we fought for the royal stuarts that reneged us against the williamites and they betrayed us remember limerick and the broken treatystone we gave our best blood to france and spain the wild geese fontenoy eh and sarsfield and odonnell duke of tetuan in spain and ulysses browne of camus that was fieldmarshal to maria teresa but what did we ever get for it the french says the citizen set of dancing masters do you know what it is they were never worth a roasted fart to ireland arent they trying to make an entente cordiale now at tay pays dinnerparty with perfidious albion firebrands of europe and they always were conspuez les franais says lenehan nobbling his beer and as for the prooshians and the hanoverians says joe havent we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from george the elector down to the german lad and the flatulent old bitch thats dead jesus i had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her blind drunk in her royal palace every night of god old vic with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about ehren on the rhine and come where the boose is cheaper well says j j we have edward the peacemaker now tell that to a fool says the citizen theres a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo edward guelphwettin and what do you think says joe of the holy boys the priests and bishops of ireland doing up his room in maynooth in his satanic majestys racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode the earl of dublin no less they ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself says little alf and says j j considerations of space influenced their lordships decision will you try another citizen says joe yes sir says he i will you says joe beholden to you joe says i may your shadow never grow less repeat that dose says joe bloom was talking and talking with john wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about persecution says he all the history of the world is full of it perpetuating national hatred among nations but do you know what a nation means says john wyse yes says bloom what is it says john wyse a nation says bloom a nation is the same people living in the same place by god then says ned laughing if thats so im a nation for im living in the same place for the past five years so of course everyone had the laugh at bloom and says he trying to muck out of it or also living in different places that covers my case says joe what is your nation if i may ask says the citizen ireland says bloom i was born here ireland the citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and gob he spat a red bank oyster out of him right in the corner after you with the push joe says he taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry here you are citizen says joe take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words the muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient irish facecloth attributed to solomon of droma and manus tomaltach og macdonogh authors of the book of ballymote was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration no need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces the acme of art wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol a bogoak sceptre a north american puma a far nobler king of beasts than the british article be it said in passing a kerry calf and a golden eagle from carrantuohill the scenes depicted on the emunctory field showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones are as wonderfully beautiful and

shovel the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand on the proud promontory of dear old howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay on the weedgrown rocks along sandymount shore and last but not least on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man mary star of the sea the three girl friends were seated on the rocks enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine cissy caffrey and edy boardman with the baby in the pushcar and tommy and jacky caffrey two little curlyheaded boys dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name hms belleisle printed on both for tommy and jacky caffrey were twins scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them they were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets building castles as children do or playing with their big coloured ball happy as the day was long and edy boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight he was but eleven months and nine days old and though still a tiny toddler was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words cissy caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin now baby cissy caffrey said say out big big i want a drink of water and baby prattled after her a jink a jink a jawbo cissy caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children so patient with little sufferers and tommy caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was cissy caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on what a persuasive power that girl had but to be sure baby boardman was as good as gold a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib none of your spoilt beauties flora macflimsy sort was cissy caffrey a truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips a girl lovable in the extreme and edy boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother but just then there was a slight altercation between master tommy and master jacky boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the martello tower had but if master tommy was headstrong master jacky was selfwilled too and true to the maxim that every little irishmans house is his castle he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and alas to relate the coveted castle too needless to say the cries of discomfited master tommy drew the attention of the girl friends come here tommy his sister called imperatively at once and you jacky for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand wait till i catch you for that his eyes misty with unshed tears master tommy came at her call for their big sisters word was law with the twins and in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure his little manowar top and unmentionables were full of sand but cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over lifes tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at master jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldnt be far from him her eyes dancing in admonition nasty bold jacky she cried she put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly whats your name butter and cream tell us who is your sweetheart spoke edy boardman is cissy your sweetheart nao tearful tommy said is edy boardman your sweetheart cissy queried nao tommy said i know edy boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes i know who is tommys sweetheart gerty is tommys sweetheart nao tommy said on the verge of tears cissys quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to edy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldnt see and to mind he didnt wet his new tan shoes but who was gerty gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions lost in thought gazing far away into the distance was in very truth as fair a specimen of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see she was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though as folks often said she was more a giltrap than a macdowell her figure was slight and graceful inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the widow welchs female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling the waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine cupids bow greekly perfect her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either bertha supple told that once to edy boardman a deliberate lie when she was black out at daggers drawn with gerty the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or shed never speak to her again no honour where honour is due there was an innate refinement a languid queenly hauteur about gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education gerty macdowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her mayhap it was this the love that might have been that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look tense with suppressed meaning that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes a charm few could resist why have women such eyes of witchery gertys were of the bluest irish blue set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive it was madame vera verity directress of the woman beautiful page of the princess novelette who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes so becoming in leaders of fashion and she had never regretted it then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose that would suit mrs dignam because she had a button one but gertys crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair it was dark brown with a natural wave in it she had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too thursday for wealth and just now at edys words as a telltale flush delicate as the faintest rosebloom crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety gods fair land of ireland did not hold her equal for an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes she was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue inclination prompted her to speak out dignity told her to be silent the pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young may morning she knew right well noone better what made squinty edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers quarrel as per usual somebodys nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother w e wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in trinity college university little recked he perhaps for what she felt that dull aching void in her heart sometimes piercing to the core yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time they were protestants in his family and of course gerty knew who came first and after him the blessed virgin and then saint joseph but he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked every inch a gentleman the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why edy boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didnt go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of dame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out a neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes because it was expected in the ladys pictorial that electric blue would be worn with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection she wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone all tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at clerys summer sales the very it slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice seven fingers two and a penny she did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her and when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew her shoes were the newest thing in footwear edy boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot like gerty macdowell a five and never would ash oak or elm with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops as for undies they were gertys chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen though gerty would never see seventeen again can find it in his heart to blame her she had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery three garments and nighties extra and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons rosepink pale blue mauve and peagreen and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldnt trust those washerwomen as far as shed see them scorching the things she was wearing the blue for luck hoping against hope her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasnt of a friday and yet and yet that strained look on her face a gnawing sorrow is there all the time her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where giving way to tears she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelingsthough not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror you are lovely gerty it said the paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful gerty macdowell yearns in vain yes she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for mrs reggy wylie t c d because the one who married the elder brother would be mrs wylie and in the fashionable intelligence mrs gertrude wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be he was too young to understand he would not believe in love a womans birthright the night of the party long ago in stoers he was still in short trousers when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips he called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss the first but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments impetuous fellow strength of character had never been reggy wylies strong point and he who would woo and win gerty macdowell must be a man among men but waiting always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over no prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey and who would understand take her in his sheltering arms strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss it would be like heaven for such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve with all the heart of her she longs to be his only his affianced bride for riches for poor in sickness in health till death us two part from this to this day forward and while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face bertha supple too and edy little spitfire because she would be twentytwo in november she would care for him with creature comforts too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen anns pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didnt like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldnt eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa giltraps lovely dog garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in clerys summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses he would be tall with broad shoulders she had always admired tall men for a husband with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon three wonderful weeks and then when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house every morning they would both have brekky simple but perfectly served for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight but tommy said he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it thered be wigs on the green but tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground if you please the temper of him o he was a man already was little tommy caffrey since he was out of pinnies edy told him no no and to be off now with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him youre not my sister naughty tommy said its my ball but cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and tommy after it in full career having won the day anything for a quiet life laughed ciss and she tickled tiny tots two cheeks to make him forget and played heres the lord mayor heres his two horses heres his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in chinchopper chinchopper chinchopper chin but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him id like to give him something she said so i would where i wont say on the beeoteetom laughed cissy merrily gerty macdowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud shed be ashamed of her life to say flushing a deep rosy red and edy boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said but not a pin cared ciss let him she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose give it to him too on the same place as quick as id look at him madcap ciss with her golliwog curls you had to laugh at her sometimes for instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the mens faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white that was just like cissycums o and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her fathers suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down tritonville road smoking a cigarette there was none to come up to her for fun but she was sincerity itself one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made not one of your twofaced things too sweet to be wholesome and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ it was the mens temperance retreat conducted by the missioner the reverend john hughes s j rosary sermon and benediction of the most blessed sacrament they were there gathered together without distinction of social class and a most edifying spectacle it was to see in that simple fane beside the waves after the storms of this weary world kneeling before the feet of the immaculate reciting the litany of our lady of loreto beseeching her to intercede for them the old familiar words holy mary holy virgin of virgins how sad to poor gertys ears had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in pearsons weekly she might now be rolling in her carriage second to none over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket thinking but that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cist its shadow over her childhood days nay she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father a prey to the fumes of intoxication forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low and still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful virgin most merciful and gerty rapt in thought scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off sandymount green that cissy caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk you never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face it was a palpable case of doctor fell or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose poor father with all his faults she loved him still when he sang tell me mary how to woo thee or my love and cottage near rochelle and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with lazenbys salad dressing for supper and when he sang the moon hath raised with mr dignam that died suddenly and was buried god have mercy on him from a stroke her mothers birthday that was and charley was home on his holidays and tom and mr dignam and mrs and patsy and freddy dignam and they were to have had a group taken noone would have thought the end was so near now he was laid to rest and her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldnt even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about catesbys cork lino artistic standard designs fit for a palace gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home a sterling good daughter was gerty just like a second mother in the house a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold and when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but gerty though she didnt like her mothers taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about taking snuff everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways it was gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime mr tunney the grocers christmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window you could see there was a story behind it the colours were done something lovely she was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat she often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in walkers pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant the twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last master jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks needless to say poor tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under gertys skirt near the little pool by the rock the twins clamoured again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadnt come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and edy and cissy laughed if you fail try again edy boardman said gerty smiled assent and bit her lip a delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking she felt the warm flush a danger signal always with gerty macdowell surging and flaming into her cheeks till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight wan and strangely drawn seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin spiritual vessel pray for us honourable vessel pray for us vessel of singular devotion pray for us mystical rose and careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told them what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary the most pious virgins intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her the twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers cissy caffrey played with baby boardman till he crowed with glee clapping baby hands in air peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was cissy gone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah and my word didnt the little chap enjoy that and then she told him to say papa say papa baby say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health a perfect little bunch of love and he would certainly turn out to be something great they said haja ja ja haja cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out holy saint denis that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa and two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks it was all no use soothering him with no nono baby no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but ciss always readywitted gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves no hour to be out and the little brats of twins she gazed out towards the distant sea it was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out the evening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft and while she gazed her heart went pitapat yes it was her he was looking at and there was meaning in his look his eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through read her very soul wonderful eyes they were superbly expressive but could you trust them people were so queer she could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner the image of the photo she had of martin harvey the matinee idol only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasnt stagestruck like winny rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly retrouss from where he was sitting he was in deep mourning she could see that and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face she would have given worlds to know what it was he was looking up so intently so still and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down she was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking reggy wylie might be out but that was far away here was that of which she had so often dreamed it was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like noone else the very heart of the girlwoman went out to him her dreamhusband because she knew on the instant it was him if he had suffered more sinned against than sinning or even even if he had been himself a sinner a wicked man she cared not even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her there were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm she was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known those cyclists showing off what they hadnt got and she just yearned to know all to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her make him forget the memory of the past then mayhap he would embrace her gently like a real man crushing her soft body to him and love her his ownest girlie for herself alone refuge of sinners comfortress of the afflicted ora pro nobis well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart gerty could picture the whole scene in the church the stained glass windows lighted up the candles the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed virgins sodality and father conroy was helping canon ohanlon at the altar carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of saint dominic he told her that time when she told him about that in confession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to natures laws he said in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by god he said and that our blessed lady herself said to the archangel gabriel be it done unto me according to thy word he was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or some place the exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it little monkeys common as ditchwater someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places the both of them and cissy and edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned jacky tommy not they what a great notion they had so cissy said it was the very last time shed ever bring them out she jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldnt get it to grow long because it wasnt natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didnt rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible it would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked french heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble tableau that would have been a very charming expose for a gentleman like that to witness queen of angels queen of patriarchs queen of prophets of all saints they prayed queen of the most holy rosary and then father conroy handed the thurible to canon ohanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed sacrament and cissy caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didnt because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then canon ohanlon handed the thurible back to father conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing the tantum ergo and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the tantumer gosa cramen tum three and eleven she paid for those stockings in sparrows of georges street on the tuesday no the monday before easter and there wasnt a brack on them and that was what he was looking at transparent and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form the cheek of her because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girls shouldersa radiant little vision in sooth almost maddening in its sweetness you would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that she could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve she put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes he was eying her as a snake eyes its prey her womans instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose edy boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at gerty half smiling with her specs like an old maid pretending to nurse the baby irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why noone could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers and she said to gerty a penny for your thoughts what replied gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth i was only wondering was it late because she wished to goodness theyd take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late and when cissy came up edy asked her the time and miss cissy as glib as you like said it was half past kissing time time to kiss again but edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early wait said cissy ill run ask my uncle peter over there whats the time by his conundrum so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket getting nervous and beginning to play with his watchchain looking up at the church passionate nature though he was gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself one moment he had been there fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order then they sang the second verse of the tantum ergo and canon ohanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told father conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and father conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time it was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets she felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon his dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour literally worshipping at her shrine if ever there was undisguised admiration in a mans passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that mans face it is for you gertrude macdowell and you know it edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon ohanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out panem de coelo praestitisti eis and edy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over gerty winced sharply a brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable it hurto yes it cut deep because edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was gertys lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat so slim so flawless so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of she had loved him better than he knew lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see o responded gerty quick as lightning laughing and the proud head flashed up i can throw my cap at who i like because its leap year her words rang out crystalclear more musical than the cooing of the ringdove but they cut the silence icily there was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with as for mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot miss puny little edys countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it the little kinnatt because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof apart in another sphere that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it edy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for master boardman junior and cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky laughing up out of his gleeful eyes and cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby without as much as by your leave sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib o my puddeny pie protested ciss he has his bib destroyed the slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because canon ohanlon was up on the altar with the veil that father conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands how moving the scene there in the gathering twilight the last glimpse of erin the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk hither thither with a tiny lost cry and she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where reggy wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book the lamplighter by miss cummins author of mabel vaughan and other tales for gerty had her dreams that noone knew of she loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from bertha supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which though it did not err on the side of luxury was scrupulously neat and clean it was there she kept her girlish treasure trove the tortoiseshell combs her child of mary badge the whiterose scent the eyebrowleine her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in helys of dame street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs art thou real my ideal it was called by louis j walsh magherafelt and after there was something about twilight wilt thou ever and ofttimes the beauty of poetry so sad in its transient loveliness had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her one by one and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it but it must end she felt if she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her love laughs at locksmiths she would make the great sacrifice her every effort would be to share his thoughts dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness there was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse cruel only to be kind but even ifwhat then would it make a very great difference from everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled she loathed that sort of person the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girls honour degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station no no not that they would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of society with a big ess perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall she thought she understood she would try to understand him because men were so different the old love was waiting waiting with little white hands stretched out with blue appealing eyes heart of mine she would follow her dream of love the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide nothing else mattered come what might she would be wild untrammelled free canon ohanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang laudate dominum omnes gentes and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and father conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat edy asked wasnt she coming but jacky caffrey called out o look cissy and they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church blue and then green and purple its fireworks cissy caffrey said and they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church helterskelter edy with the pushcar with baby boardman in it and cissy holding tommy and jacky by the hand so they wouldnt fall running come on gerty cissy called its the bazaar fireworks but gerty was adamant she had no intention of being at their beck and call if they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was the eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling she looked at him a moment meeting his glance and a light broke in upon her whitehot passion was in that face passion silent as the grave and it had made her his at last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death steadfast a sterling man a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips his hands and face were working and a tremour went over her she leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was noone to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that supply soft and delicately rounded and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart his hoarse breathing because she knew too about the passion of men like that hotblooded because bertha supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear shed never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the congested districts board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed but this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips besides there was absolution so long as you didnt do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and cissy caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too my dear and winny rippingham so mad about actors photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did and jacky caffrey shouted to look there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look look there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air a soft thing to and fro dark and she saw a long roman candle going up over the trees up up and in the tense hush they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it high high almost out of sight and her face was suffused with a divine an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too nainsook knickers the fabric that caresses the skin better than those other pettiwidth the green four and eleven on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where noone ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasnt ashamed and he wasnt either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldnt resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking looking she would fain have cried to him chokingly held out her snowy slender arms to him to come to feel his lips laid on her white brow the cry of a young girls love a little strangled cry wrung from her that cry that has rung through the ages and then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and o then the roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of o and everyone cried o o in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden o so lovely o soft sweet soft then all melted away dewily in the grey air all was silent ah she glanced at him as she bent forward quickly a pathetic little glance of piteous protest of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl he was leaning back against the rock behind leopold bloom for it is he stands silent with bowed head before those young guileless eyes what a brute he had been at it again a fair unsullied soul had called to him and wretch that he was how had he answered an utter cad he had been he of all men but there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered should a girl tell no a thousand times no that was their secret only theirs alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats dont tell cissy caffrey whistled imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was and then she cried gerty gerty were going come on we can see from farther up gerty had an idea one of loves little ruses she slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back wonder if hes too far to she rose was it goodbye no she had to go but they would meet again there and she would dream of that till then tomorrow of her dream of yester eve she drew herself up to her full height their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart full of a strange shining hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face she half smiled at him wanly a sweet forgiving smile a smile that verged on tears and then they parted slowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand to cissy to edy to jacky and tommy caffrey to little baby boardman it was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed she walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly becausebecause gerty macdowell was tight boots no shes lame o mr bloom watched her as she limped away poor girl thats why shes left on the shelf and the others did a sprint thought something was wrong by the cut of

both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other therefore everyman look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mothers womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came the man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed the nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be she said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that womans birth then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house the man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder womens woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless and whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat and there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept dixon and the traveller leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there and the traveller leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery and in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously and there were vessels that are wrought by magic of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer and there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so and these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain and they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each and childe leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile and he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile thanked be almighty god this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child a gentle dame whose time hied fast sir leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel said he that it be not come or now meseems it dureth overlong and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently but said he or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long and the franklin that had drunken said expecting each moment to be her next also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and now drink said he fully delectably and he quaffed as far as he might to their boths health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup womans woe with wonder pondering now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might there was a sort of scholars along either side the board that is to wit dixon yclept junior of saint mary merciables with other his fellows lynch and madden scholars of medicine and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa one crotthers and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested and of all them reserved young stephen he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead and beside the meek sir leopold but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner ruth red him love led on with will to wander loth to leave for they were right witty scholars and he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in hornes house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case and they said farther she should live because in the beginning they said the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy a redress god grant this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay by our virgin mother the wife should live and the babe to die in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved to whom young stephen had these words following murmur sirs is eke oft among lay folk both babe and parent now glorify their maker the one in limbo gloom the other in purgefire but gramercy what of those godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise which is the sin against the holy ghost very god lord and giver of life for sirs he said our lust is brief we are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we then said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what ends but he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachis praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever then spake young stephen orgulous of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom of law of canons of lilith patron of abortions of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or as virgilius saith by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with effectu secuto or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for gods greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fishermans seal even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life a wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and laying hand to jaw he said dissembling as his wont was that as it was informed him who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions that is truth pardy said dixon and or i err a pregnant word which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons but sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lambs wool the flower of the flock lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled for it was then about the midst of the winter and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friends son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for all accounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff he gave them for a pledge the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray now drink we quod he of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my souls bodiment leave ye

he heard hereof counted he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too waxing merry and toasting to his fathership but he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the

thunderhead look you having taken place and all of the order of a natural phenomenon but was young boasthards fear vanquished by calmers words no for he had in his bosom a spike named bitterness which could not by words be done away and was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either but could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle holiness that then he lived withal indeed no for grace was not there to find that bottle heard he then in that clap the voice of the god bringforth or what calmer said a hubbub of phenomenon heard why he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube understanding which he had not done for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show and would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away by no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law then wotted he nought of that other land which is called believeonme that is the land of

beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as ho you pretty man turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named twointhebush or by some learned carnal concupiscence this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in manse of mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore birdinthehand which was within all foul plagues monsters and a wicked devil they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her for regarding believeonme they

the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that nights gazette and he made a show to find it about him for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it but on stephens persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk he was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat to tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps ostlers bookies pauls men runners flatcaps waistcoateers ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip he took his ordinary at a boilingcooks and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with

says frank that was his name tis all about kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague but they can go hang says he with a wink for me with their bully beef a pox on it theres as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset mort aux vaches says frank then in the french language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in bordeaux and he spoke french like a gentleman too from a child this frank had been a donought that his father a headborough who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes one time he would be a playactor then a sutler or a welsher then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk kidnapping a squires heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids linen or choking chicken behind a hedge he had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him what says mr leopold with his hands across that was earnest to know the drift of it will they slaughter all i protest i saw them but this day morning going to the liverpool boats says he i can scarce believe tis so bad says he and he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers greasy hoggets and wether wool having been some years before actuary for mr joseph cuffe a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by mr gavin lows yard in prussia street i question with you there says he more like tis the hoose or the timber tongue mr stephen a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperors chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality that was sending over doctor rinderpest the bestquoted cowcatcher in all muscovy with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns come come says mr vincent plain dealing hell find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull thats irish says he irish by name and irish by nature says mr stephen and he sent the ale purling about an irish bull in an english chinashop i conceive you says mr dixon it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas the bravest cattlebreeder of them all with an emerald ring in his nose true for you says mr vincent cross the table and a bullseye into the bargain says he and a plumper and a portlier bull says he never shit on shamrock he had horns galore a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island leaving doughballs and rollingpins followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains what for that says mr dixon but before he came over farmer nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself so be off now says he and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmers blessing and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly but the slap and the blessing stood him friend says mr vincent for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid wife abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all ireland another then put in his word and they dressed him says he in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his hearts content by this time the father of the faithful for so they called him was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture to remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls language and they all after him ay says another and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice saying by the lord harry green is the grass that grows on the ground and says mr dixon if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or the wilds of connemara or a husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out hed run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord harrys orders there was bad blood between them at first says mr vincent and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and ill meddle in his matters says he ill make that animal smell hell says he with the help of that good pizzle my father left me but one evening says mr dixon when the lord harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the romans bos bovum which is good bog latin for boss of the show after that says mr vincent the lord harry put his head into a cows drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name then with the water running off him he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat in short he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt they were says mr stephen and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward as the ungrate women were all of one mind made a wherry raft loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard set all masts erect manned the yards sprang their luff heaved to spread three sheets in the wind put her head between wind and water weighed anchor ported her helm ran up the jolly roger gave three times three let the bullgine run pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of america which was the occasion says mr vincent of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty pope peters but a pissabed a mans a man for a that our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered a young gentleman his name alec bannon who had late come to town it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at mr quinnells bearing a legend printed in fair italics mr malachi mulligan fertiliser and incubator lambay island his project as he went on to expound was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir fopling popinjay and sir milksop quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed well let us hear of it good my friend said mr dixon i make no doubt it smacks of wenching come be seated both tis as cheap sitting as standing mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and expatiating upon his design told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility both the inhibitory and the prohibitory whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired it grieved him plaguily he said to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures a prey to the vilest bonzes who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress this he assured them made his heart weep to curb this inconvenient which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of lambay island from its holder lord talbot de malahide a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party he proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named omphalos with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural money was no object he said nor would he take a penny for his pains the poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions would find in him their man for his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it they both it seems had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water as might be observed by mr mulligans smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of marys excepted to it asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle mr mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which as it dwelt upon his memory seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi o quirites ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum romanorum magnopere anteponunt while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach the buck and doe of the forest glade the farmyard drake and duck valuing himself not a little upon his elegance being indeed a proper man of person this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced the young gentleman his friend overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour mr mulligan now perceiving the table asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and seeing the stranger he made him a civil bow and said pray sir was you in need of any professional assistance we could give who upon his offer thanked him very heartily though preserving his proper distance and replied that he was come there about a lady now an inmate of hornes house that was in an interesting condition poor body from womans woe and here he fetched a deep sigh to know if her happiness had yet taken place mr dixon to turn the table took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence upon which he rallied him betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due as with the noted physician mr austin meldon to a wolf in the stomach for answer mr mulligan in a gale of laughter at his smalls smote himself bravely below the diaphragm exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of mother grogan the most excellent creature of her sex though tis pity shes a trollop theres a belly that never bore a bastard this was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight the spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber here the listener who was none other than the scotch student a little fume of a fellow blond as tow congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and interrupting the narrative at a salient point having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it mais bien sr noble stranger said he cheerily et mille compliments that you may and very opportunely there wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity but gracious heaven was i left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well my god i would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the giver of good things with these words he approached the goblet to his lips took a complacent draught of the cordial slicked his hair and opening his bosom out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness ah monsieur he said had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily in such an artless disorder of so melting a tenderness pon my conscience even you monsieur had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever i declare i was never so touched in all my life god i thank thee as the author of my days thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and having replaced the locket in his bosom he wiped his eye and sighed again beneficent disseminator of blessings to all thy creatures how great and universal must be that sweetest of thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond the simple swain and the polished coxcomb the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years but indeed sir i wander from the point how mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys maledicity he exclaimed in anguish would to god that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along i could weep to think of it then though it had poured seven showers we were neither of us a penny the worse but beshrew me he cried clapping hand to his forehead tomorrow will be a new day and thousand thunders i know of a marchand de capotes monsieur poyntz from whom i can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the french fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting tut tut cries le fecondateur tripping in my friend monsieur moore that most accomplished traveller i have just cracked a half bottle avec lui in a circle of the best wits of the town is my authority that in cape horn ventre biche they have a rain that will wet through any even the stoutest cloak a drenching of that violence he tells me sans blague has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world pooh a livre cries monsieur lynch the clumsy things are dear at a sou one umbrella were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom is worth ten such stopgaps no woman of any wit would wear one my dear kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for as she reminded me blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies dame nature by the divine blessing has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that il y a deux choses for which the innocence of our original garb in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties is the fittest nay the only garment the first said she and here my pretty philosopher as i handed her to her tilbury to fix my attention gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear the first is a bath but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and while all were conjecturing what might be the cause miss callan entered and having spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr dixon retired with a profound bow to the company the presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry strike me silly said costello a low fellow who was fuddled a monstrous fine bit of cowflesh ill be sworn she has rendezvoused you what you dog have you a way with them gads bud immensely so said mr lynch the bedside manner it is that they use in the mater hospice demme does not doctor ogargle chuck the nuns there under the chin as i look to be saved i had it from my kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months lawksamercy doctor cried the young blood in the primrose vest feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body how you do tease a body drat the man bless me im all of a wibbly wobbly why youre as bad as dear little father cantekissem that you are may this pot of four half choke me cried costello if she aint in the family way i knows a lady whats got a white swelling quick as i claps eyes on her the young surgeon however rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy i want patience said he with those who without wit to enliven or learning to instruct revile an ennobling profession which saving the reverence due to the deity is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth i am positive when i say that if need were i could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which so far from being a byword should be a glorious incentive in the human breast i cannot away with them what malign such an one the amiable miss callan who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours and at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay perish the thought i shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of horne having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door a murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation for he swore a round hand that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath stap my vitals said he them was always the sentiments of honest frank costello which i was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what i always looks back on with a loving heart to revert to mr bloom who after his first entry had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity the young sparks it is true were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice their testiness and outrageous mots were such that his intellects resiled from nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf but the word of mr costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world which the dint of the surgeons pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creations chain desiderated by the late ingenious mr darwin it was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and by intercepting them with the readiest precaution foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable to those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy a habit of mind which he never did hold with to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding while for such that having lost all forbearance can lose no more there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe is ever as the chaste fancy of the holy writer expresses it for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions to conclude while from the sisters words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was however it must be owned not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the supreme being accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour saying that to express his notion of the thing his opinion who ought not perchance to express one was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers the dressy young blade said it was her husbands that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another ephesian matron i must acquaint you said mr crotthers clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis old glory allelujurum was round again today an elderly man with dundrearies preferring through his nose a request to have word of wilhelmina my life as he calls her i bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon slife ill be round with you i cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her all fell to praising of it each after his own fashion though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap a clerk in orders a linkboy virtuous or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household singular communed the guest with himself the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest but he further added it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for i have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together but with what fitness let it be asked of the noble lord his patron has this alien whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled during the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is if report belie him not his own and his only enjoyer far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady the daughter of a gallant major or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done then be it so unhappy woman she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate he says this a censor of morals a very pelican in his piety who did not scruple oblivious of the ties of nature to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society nay had the hussys scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel it had gone with her as hard as with hagar the egyptian in the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in mr cuffes hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic it ill becomes him to preach that gospel has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare a habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life if he must dispense his balm of gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him his marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce the lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which when rooted in its native orient throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but transplanted to a clime more temperate its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant acid and inoperative the news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the sublime porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born when he had betaken himself to the womens apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier broke out at once into a strife of tongues in vain the voice of mr canvasser bloom was heard endeavouring to urge to mollify to refrain the moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers the caesarean section posthumity with respect to the father and that rarer form with respect to the

brutes his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the minotaur which the genius of the elegant latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his metamorphoses the impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived it was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from mr candidate mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man contemporaneously a heated argument having arisen between mr delegate madden and mr candidate lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one siamese twin predeceasing the other the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to mr canvasser bloom for instant submittal to mr

school together in conmees time he asked about glaucon alcibiades pisistratus where were they now neither knew you have spoken of the past and its phantoms stephen said why think of them if i call

gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves smiling at vincent that answer and those leaves vincent said to him will adorn you more fitly when something more and greatly more than a capful of light odes

vincent lenehan said laying a hand on the shoulder near him have no fear he could not leave his mother an orphan the young mans face grew dark all could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss he would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart madden had lost five drachmas on sceptre for a whim of the riders name lenehan as much more he told them of the race the flag fell and huuh off scamper the mare ran out freshly with 0 madden up she was leading the field all hearts were beating even phyllis could not contain

gad sir a queen of them do you remember her vincent i wish you could have seen my queen today vincent said how young she was and radiant lalage were scarce fair beside her in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin i do not know the right name of it the chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us in the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with corinth fruit in them that periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge but she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which i held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when i pressed too close a week ago she lay ill four days on the couch but today she was free blithe mocked at peril she is more taking then her posies tool mad romp that she is she had pulled her fill as we reclined together and in your ear my friend you will not think who met us as we left the field conmee himself he was walking by the hedge reading i think a brevier book with i doubt not a witty letter in it from glycera or chloe to keep the page the sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her when conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries but he had been kind in going by he had blessed us the gods too are ever kind lenehan said if i had poor luck with basss mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely he was laying his hand upon a winejar malachi saw it and withheld his act pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label warily malachi whispered preserve a druid silence his soul is far away it is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born any object intensely regarded may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods do you not think it stephen theosophos told me so stephen answered whom in a previous existence egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law the lords of the moon theosophos told me an orangefiery shipload from planet alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation however as a matter of fact though the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character was not the case at all the individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop during the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass bottled by messrs bass and co at burtonontrent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyones remark on account of its scarlet appearance he was simply and solely as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings after the moment befores observations about boyhood days and the turf recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn eventually however both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with also at the same time however a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place the debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life neither place nor council was lacking in dignity the debaters were the keenest in the land the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital the high hall of hornes house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic a gallant scene in truth it made crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking highland garb his face glowing from the briny airs of the mull of galloway there too opposite to him was lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom next the scotchman was the place assigned to costello the eccentric while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of madden the chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of bannon in explorers kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of malachi roland st john mulligan lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of socratic discussion while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator fresh from the hippodrome and that vigilant wanderer soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has limned for ages yet to come it had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which mr s dedalus div scep contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods science it cannot be too often repeated deals with tangible phenomena the man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can there may be it is true some questions which science cannot answerat presentsuch as the first problem submitted by mr l bloom pubb canv regarding the future determination of sex must we accept the view of empedocles of trinacria that the right ovary the postmenstrual period assert others is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it as most embryologists incline to opine such as culpepper spallanzani blumenbach lusk hertwig leopold and valenti a mixture of both this would be tantamount to a cooperation one of natures favourite devices between the nisus formativus of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position succubitus felix of the passive element the other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital infant mortality it is interesting because as he pertinently remarks we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways mr m mulligan hyg et eug

these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect private or official culminating in the exposure of newborn infants the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide although the former we are thinking of neglect is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative in fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions an ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by mr v

workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood though other children of the same marriage do not must certainly in the poets words give us pause nature we may rest assured has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development an arrangement which though productive of pain to some of our feelings notably the maternal is nevertheless some of us think in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest mr s dedalus div scep remark or should it be called an interruption that an omnivorous being which can masticate

shakes his head in mute mirthful reply with thumb and palm corny kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done with a slow nod bloom conveys his

kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay the tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay bloom holding in his hand stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant stands irresolute then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder bloom eh ho there is no answer he bends again mr dedalus there is no answer the name if you call somnambulist he bends again and hesitating brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form stephen there is no answer he calls again stephen stephen groans who black panther vampire he sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels who drive fergus now and pierce woods woven shade he turns on his left side sighing doubling himself together bloom poetry well educated pity he bends again and undoes the buttons of stephens waistcoat to breathe he brushes the woodshavings from stephens clothes with light hand and fingers one pound seven not hurt anyhow he listens what stephen murmurs shadows the woods white breast dim sea he stretches out his arms sighs again and curls his body bloom holding the hat and ashplant stands erect a dog barks in the distance bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant he looks down on stephens face and form bloom communes with the night face reminds me of his poor mother in the shady wood the deep white breast ferguson i think i caught a girl some girl best thing could happen him he murmurs swear that i will always hail ever conceal never reveal any part or parts art or arts he murmurs in the rough sands of the sea a cabletows length from the shore where the tide ebbs and flows silent thoughtful alert he stands on guard his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master against the dark wall a figure appears slowly a fairy boy of eleven a changeling kidnapped dressed in an eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet holding a book in his hand he reads from right to left inaudibly smiling kissing the page bloom wonderstruck calls inaudibly rudy rudy gazes unseeing into blooms eyes and goes on reading kissing smiling he has a delicate mauve face on his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons in his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot a white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket iii preparatory to anything else mr bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox samaritan fashion which he very badly needed his stephens mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting off the reel the propriety of the cabmans shelter as it was called hardly a stonesthrow away near butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral but how to get there was the rub for the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which stephen repeatedly yawned so far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition both of them being eded particularly stephen always assuming that there was such a thing to be found accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line they both walked together along beaver street or more properly lane as far as the farriers and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergins but as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree outside the north star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when mr bloom who was anything but a professional whistler endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle holding his arms arched over his head twice this was a quandary but bringing common sense to bear on it evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did so bevelling around by mulletts and the signal house which they shortly reached they proceeded perforce in the direction of amiens street railway terminus mr bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had to vary the timehonoured adage gone the way of all buttons though entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing he heroically made light of the mischance so as neither of them were particularly pressed for time as it happened and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of jupiter pluvius they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey as it so happened a dublin united tramways companys sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway station the starting point for belfast where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue a not very enticing locality not to say gruesome to a degree more especially at night ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course turned into store street famous for its c division police station between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of beresford place stephen thought to think of ibsen associated with bairds the stonecutters in his mind somehow in talbot place first turning on the right while the other who was acting as his fidus achates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of james rourkes city bakery situated quite close to where they were the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable bread the staff of life earn your bread o tell me where is fancy bread at rourkes the bakers it is said en route to his taciturn and not to put too fine a point on it not yet perfectly sober companion mr bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties never more so in fact disgustingly sober spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown women of ill fame and swell mobsmen which barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didnt look out highly providential was the appearance on the scene of corny kelleher when stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or failing that the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before mr tobias or he being the solicitor rather old wall he meant to say or mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about the reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen whom he cordially disliked were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the crown and as mr bloom put it recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil street prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city pembroke road for example the guardians of the law were well in evidence the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything you frittered away your time he very sensibly maintained and health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing fast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of l s d into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though touching the much vexed question of stimulants he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of stephen by all his pubhunting confreres but one a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs and that one was judas stephen said who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox he began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his fathers gumley to avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge someone saluted you mr bloom said a figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again calling night stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment mr bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least though unusual in the dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper famished loiterers of the thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moments notice your money or your life leaving you there to point a moral gagged and garrotted stephen that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised corleys breath redolent of rotten cornjuice lord john corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise he was the eldest son of inspector corley of the g division lately deceased who had married a certain katherine brophy the daughter of a louth farmer his grandfather patrick michael corley of new ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine also talbot rumour had it though not proved that she descended from the house of the lords talbot de malahide in whose mansion really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing her mother or aunt or some relative a woman as the tale went of extreme beauty had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen this therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as lord john corley taking stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell not as much as a farthing to purchase a nights lodgings his friends had all deserted him furthermore he had a row with lenehan and called him to stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions he was out of a job and implored of stephen to tell him where on gods earth he could get something anything at all to do no it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasnt a complete fabrication from start to finish anyhow he was all in i wouldnt ask you only pursued he on my solemn oath and god knows im on the rocks therell be a job tomorrow or next day stephen told him in a boys school at dalkey for a gentleman usher mr garrett deasy try it you may mention my name ah god corley replied sure i couldnt teach in a school man i was never one of your bright ones he added with a half laugh i got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers i have no place to sleep myself stephen informed him corley at the first gooff was inclined to suspect it was something to do with stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street there was a dosshouse in marlborough street mrs maloneys but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but mconachie told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over in winetavern street which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar bacon for a bob he was starving too though he hadnt said a word about it though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still stephens feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that corleys brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence however haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera as the latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished but the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of corleys head that he was living in affluence and hadnt a thing to do but hand out the needful whereas he put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for to his chagrin he found his cash missing a few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation he tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout very much the reverse in fact he was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect about biscuits he dimly remembered who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy however in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies erroneously however as it turned out those are halfcrowns man corley corrected him and so in point of fact they turned out to be stephen anyhow lent him one of them thanks corley answered youre a gentleman ill pay you back one time whos that with you i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse in camden street with boylan the billsticker you might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there id carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me theyre full up for the next three weeks man god youve to book ahead man youd think it was for the carl rosa i dont give a shite anyway so long as i get a job even as a crossing sweeper subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags comisky that he said stephen knew well out of fullams the shipchandlers bookkeeper there that used to be often round in nagles back with omara and a little chap with a stutter the name of tighe anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable 210 mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchmans sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work it struck him was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while dublin slept he threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at stephens anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round in every deep so to put it a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very rara avis altogether in any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning pretty thick that was certainly the pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom who with his practised eye was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite alluding to the encounter he said laughingly stephen that is he is down on his luck he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named boylan a billsticker to give him a job as a sandwichman at this intelligence in which he seemingly evinced little interest mr bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana moored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair whereupon he observed evasively everybody gets their own ration of luck they say now you mention it his face was familiar to me but leaving that for the moment how much did you part with he queried if i am not too inquisitive half a crown stephen responded i daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere needs mr bloom ejaculated professing not the least surprise at the intelligence i can quite credit the assertion and i guarantee he invariably does everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds but talking about things in general where added he with a smile will you sleep yourself walking to sandycove is out of the question and even supposing you did you wont get in after what occurred at westland row station simply fag out there for nothing i dont mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your fathers house to seek misfortune was stephens answer i met your respected father on a recent occasion mr bloom diplomatically returned today in fact or to be strictly accurate on yesterday where does he live at present i gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved i believe he is in dublin somewhere stephen answered unconcernedly why a gifted man mr bloom said of mr dedalus senior in more respects than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one he takes great pride quite legitimate out of you you could go back perhaps he hasarded still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at westland row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two mulligan that is and that english tourist friend of his who eventually euchred their third companion were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion which they did there was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however such as it was stephens minds eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by the ingle her hair hanging down waiting for some weak trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy boody and katey the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded it being quarter tense or if not ember days or something like that no mr bloom repeated again i wouldnt personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element dr mulligan as a guide philosopher and friend if i were in your shoes he knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals of course you didnt notice as much as i did but it wouldnt occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object he understood however from all he heard that dr mulligan was a versatile allround man by no means confined to medicine only who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and if the report was verified bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at skerries or malahide was it was he was bound to admit an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy pure and simple except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains he ventured to throw out the guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at stephens at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that high educational abilities though he possessed he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet adjacent to the mens public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way there being some little differences between the parties puttana madonna che ci dia i quattrini ho ragione culo rotto intendiamoci mezzo sovrano piu dice lui pero mezzo farabutto mortacci sui ma ascolta cinque la testa piu mr bloom and stephen entered the cabmans shelter an unpretentious wooden structure where prior to then he had rarely if ever been before the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous skinthegoat fitzharris the invincible though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in a few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity now touching a cup of coffee mr bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food say a roll of some description accordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly the hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied away though one redbearded bibulous individual portion of whose hair was greyish a sailor probably still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor mr bloom availing himself of the right of free speech he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though to be sure rather in a quandary over voglio remarked to his protg in an audible tone of voice a propos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious a beautiful language i mean for singing purposes why do you not write your poetry in that language bella poetria it is so melodious and full belladonna voglio stephen who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could suffering from lassitude generally replied to fill the ear of a cow elephant they were haggling over money is that so mr bloom asked of course he subjoined pensively at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it the keeper of the shelter in the middle of this ttette put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun or so it seemed after which he beat a retreat to his counter mr bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to for which reason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him sounds are impostures stephen said after a pause of some little time like names cicero podmore napoleon mr goodbody jesus mr doyle shakespeares were as common as murphies whats in a name yes to be sure mr bloom unaffectedly concurred of course our name was changed too he added pushing the socalled roll across the redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded stephen whom he had singled out for attention in particular squarely by asking and what might your name be just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companions boot but stephen apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter answered dedalus the sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes rather bunged up from excessive use of boose preferably good old hollands and water you know simon dedalus he asked at length ive heard of him stephen said mr bloom was all at sea for a moment seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too hes irish the seaman bold affirmed staring still in much the same way and nodding all irish all too irish stephen rejoined as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder the lefthand dead shot though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain bottles out there say fifty yards measured eggs on the bottles cocks his gun over his shoulder aims he turned his body half round shut up his right eye completely then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance pom he then shouted once the entire audience waited anticipating an additional detonation there being still a further egg pom he shouted twice egg two evidently demolished he nodded and winked adding bloodthirstily buffalo bill shoots to kill never missed nor he never will a silence ensued till mr bloom for agreeableness sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the bisley beg pardon the sailor said long ago mr bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth why the sailor replied relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond it might be a matter of ten years he toured the wide world with henglers royal circus i seen him do that in stockholm curious coincidence mr bloom confided to stephen unobtrusively murphys my name the sailor continued d b murphy of carrigaloe know where that is queenstown harbour stephen replied thats right the sailor said fort camden and fort carlisle thats where i hails from i belongs there thats where i hails from my little womans down there shes waiting for me i know for england home and beauty shes my own true wife i havent seen for seven years now sailing about mr bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene the homecoming to the mariners roadside shieling after having diddled davy jones a rainy night with a blind moon across the world for a wife quite a number of stories there were on that particular alice ben bolt topic enoch arden and rip van winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember caoc oleary a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor john casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own

her brandnew arrival is on her knee post mortem child with a high ro and a randy ro and my galloping tearing tandy o bow to the inevitable grin and bear it i remain with much love your brokenhearted husband d b murphy the sailor who scarcely seemed to be a dublin resident turned to one of the jarvies with the request you dont happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you the jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand thank you the sailor said he deposited the quid in his gob and chewing and with some slow stammers proceeded we come up this morning eleven oclock the threemaster rosevean from bridgwater with bricks i shipped to get over paid off this afternoon theres my discharge see d b murphy a b s in confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document you must have seen a fair share of the world the keeper remarked leaning on the counter why the sailor answered upon reflection upon it ive circumnavigated a bit since i first joined on i was in the red sea i was in china and north america and south america we was chased by pirates one voyage i seen icebergs plenty growlers i was in stockholm and the black sea the dardanelles under captain dalton the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship i seen russia gospodi pomilyou thats how the russians prays you seen queer sights dont be talking put in a jarvey why the sailor said shifting his partially chewed plug i seen queer things too ups and downs i seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as i chew that quid he took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and lodging it between his teeth bit ferociously khaan like that and i seen maneaters in peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses look here here they are a friend of mine sent me he fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table the printed matter on it stated choza de indios beni bolivia all focussed their attention at the scene

dead horses liver raw his postcard proved a centre of attraction for messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more know how to keep them off he inquired generally nobody volunteering a statement he winked saying glass that boggles em glass mr bloom without evincing surprise unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark it ran as follows tarjeta postal seor a boudin galeria becche santiago chile there was no message evidently as he took particular notice though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite william tell and the lazarillodon cesar de bazan incident depicted in maritana on which occasion the formers ball passed through the latters hat having detected a discrepancy between his name assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict qt somewhere and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friends bona fides nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some wednesday or saturday of travelling to london via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to holyhead which was his longest martin cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through but even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking boyds heart it was not so dear purse permitting a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to mullingar where he figured on going was five and six there and back the trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable especially for a chap whose liver was out of order seeing the different places along the route plymouth falmouth southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis the spectacle of our modern babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower abbey wealth of park lane to renew acquaintance with another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas eastbourne scarborough margate and so on beautiful bournemouth the channel islands and similar bijou spots which might prove highly remunerative not of course with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job witness mrs c p mcoy type lend me your valise and ill post you the ticket no something top notch an all star irish caste the tweedyflower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the elster grimes and moodymanners perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure but who that was the rub also without being actually positive it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the fishguardrosslare route which it was mooted was once more on the tapis in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally a great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large the average man ie brown robinson and co it was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street when the system really needed toning up for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stickinthemud took me for a wife after all hang it they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of venue after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life there were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around dublin and its picturesque environs even poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram but also farther away from the madding crowd in wicklow rightly termed the garden of ireland an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didnt come down and in the wilds of donegal where if report spoke true the coup doeil was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while howth with its historic associations and otherwise silken thomas grace omalley george iv rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young mens fancy though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally usually by the way on their left leg it being only about three quarters of an hours run from the pillar because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy so to speak and the accommodation left much to be desired interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity pure and simple was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact he turned back the other side of the card picture and passed it along to stephen i seen a chinese one time related the doughty narrator that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different one was a ship another was a house another was a flower cooks rats in your soup he appetisingly added the chinks does possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on adhering to his adventures and i seen a man killed in trieste by an italian chap knife in his back knife like that whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position in a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers fellow hid behind a door come up behind him like that prepare to meet your god says he chuk it went into his back up to the butt his heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to thats a good bit of steel repeated he examining his formidable stiletto after which harrowing denouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors otherwise pocket theyre great for the cold steel somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all that was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives at this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is bliss mr b and stephen each in his own particular way both instinctively exchanged meaning glances in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however towards where skinthegoat alias the keeper not turning a hair was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair his inscrutable face which was really a work of art a perfect study in itself beggaring description conveyed the impression that he didnt understand one jot of what was going on funny very there ensued a somewhat lengthy pause one man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal another the card with the natives choza de another the seamans discharge mr bloom so far as he was personally concerned was just pondering in pensive mood he vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles when it took the civilised world by storm figuratively speaking early in the eighties eightyone to be correct when he was just turned fifteen ay boss the sailor broke in give us back them papers the request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape have you seen the rock of gibraltar mr bloom inquired the sailor grimaced chewing in a way that might be read as yes ay or no ah youve touched there too mr bloom said europa point thinking he had in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn what year would that be about mr b interrogated can you recall the boats our soidisant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering im tired of all them rocks in the sea he said and boats and ships salt junk all the time tired seemingly he ceased his questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe suffice it to say that as a casual glance at the map revealed it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves on more than one occasion a dozen at the lowest near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt evidently derelict seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall staring quite obliviously at it and it at him dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings and it left him wondering why possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under well not exactly under tempting the fates and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all nevertheless without going into the minutiae of the business the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large no matter where living inland or seaside as the case might be having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called ireland expects that every man and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the irish lights kish and others liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy not to say stormy weather there was a fellow sailed with me in the rover the old seadog himself a rover proceeded went ashore and took up a soft job as gentlemans valet at six quid a month them are his trousers ive on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife im game for that job shaving and brushup i hate roaming about theres my son now danny run off to sea and his mother got him took in a drapers in cork where he could be drawing easy money what age is he queried one hearer who by the way seen from the side bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell the townclerk away from the carking cares of office unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage why the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance my son danny hed be about eighteen now way i figure it the skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue chinese ink intended to represent an anchor there was lice in that bunk in bridgwater he remarked sure as nuts i must get a wash tomorrow or next day its them black lads i objects to i hate those buggers suck your blood dry they does seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariners hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young mans sideface looking frowningly rather tattoo the exhibitor explained that was done when we were iying becalmed off odessa in the black sea under captain dalton fellow the name of antonio done that there he is himself a greek did it hurt much doing it one asked the sailor that worthy however was busily engaged in collecting round the someway in his squeezing or see here he said showing antonio there he is cursing the mate and there he is now he added the same fellow pulling the skin with his fingers some special knack evidently and he laughing at a yarn and in point of fact the young man named antonios livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including skinthegoat who this time stretched over ay ay sighed the sailor looking down on his manly chest hes gone too ate by sharks after ay ay he let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before neat bit of work one longshoreman said and whats the number for loafer number two queried eaten alive a third asked the sailor ay ay sighed again the latter personage more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number ate a greek he was and then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end as bad as old antonio for he left me on my ownio the face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill mr bloom scarcely knowing which way to look turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey if such he was had laid aside he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on ormond quay the partially idiotic female namely of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you mrs b and begged the chance of his washing also why washing which seemed rather vague than not your washing still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wifes undergarments when soiled in holles street and women would and did too a mans similar garments initialled with bewley and drapers marking ink hers were that is if they really loved him that is to say love me love my dirty shirt still just then being on tenterhooks he desired the females room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off round the side of the evening telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper murphys nautical chest and then there was no more of her the gunboat the keeper said it beats me mr bloom confided to stephen medically i am speaking how a wretched creature like that from the lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses if he values his health in the least unfortunate creature of course i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition still no matter what the cause is from stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders merely remarking in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul she is a bad merchant she buys dear and sells cheap the elder man though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject a necessary evil w ere not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities a thing he could truthfully state he as a paterfamilias was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start whoever embarked on a policy of the sort he said and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned you as a good catholic he observed talking of body and soul believe in the soul or do you mean the intelligence the brainpower as such as distinct from any outside object the table let us say that cup i believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter otherwise we would never have such inventions as x rays for instance do you thus cornered stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible it would be immortal i understand but for the possibility of its annihilation by its first cause who from all i can hear is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other practical jokes corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquette mr bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple promptly rejoining simple i shouldnt think that is the proper word of course i grant you to concede a point you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon but what i am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays rontgen did or the telescope like edison though i believe it was before his time galileo was the man i mean and the same applies to the laws for example of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but its a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god o that stephen expostulated has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in holy writ apart from circumstantial evidence on this knotty point however the views of the pair poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages clashed has been the more experienced of the two objected sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief im not so sure about that thats a matter for everymans opinion and without dragging in the sectarian side of the business i beg to differ with you in toto there my belief is to tell you the candid truth that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or its the big question of our national poet over again who precisely wrote them like hamlet and bacon as you who know your shakespeare infinitely better than i of course i neednt tell you cant you drink that coffee by the way let me stir it and take a piece of that bun its like one of our skippers bricks disguised still noone can give what he hasnt got try a bit couldnt stephen contrived to get out his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat mr bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the coffee palace and its temperance and lucrative work to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night concerts dramatic evenings and useful lectures admittance free by qualified men for the lower orders on the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife madam marion tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying the idea he was strongly inclined to believe was to do good and net a profit there being no competition to speak of sulphate of copper poison so4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldnt remember when it was or where anyhow inspection medical inspection of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of dr tibbles vicocoa on account of the medical analysis involved have a shot at it now he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage still its solid food his good genius urged im a stickler for solid food his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work mental or manual you ought to eat more solid food you would feel a different man liquids i can eat stephen said but o oblige me by taking away that knife i cant look at the point of it it reminds me of roman history mr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or antique about it to the lay eye observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it our mutual friends stories are like himself mr bloom apropos of knives remarked to his confidante sotto voce do you think they are genuine he could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots look at him yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel he had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina if a trifle prone to baldness there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity he might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told as people often did about others namely that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the antonio personage no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described on the other hand he might be only bluffing a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs dublin residents like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner hesperus and etcetera and when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldnt probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him mind you im not saying that its all a pure invention he resumed analogous scenes are occasionally if not often met with giants though that is rather a far cry you see once in a way marcella the midget queen in those waxworks in henry street i myself saw some aztecs as they are called sitting bowlegged they couldnt straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here you see he proceeded indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up being adored as gods theres an example again of simple souls however reverting to friend sinbad and his horrifying adventures who reminded him a bit of ludwig alias ledwidge when he occupied the boards of the gaiety when michael gunn was identified with the management in the flying dutchman a stupendous success and his host of admirers came in large numbers everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort phantom or the reverse on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it he conceded on the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little italy there near the coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on the quiet and he added on the cheap spaniards for instance he continued passionate temperaments like that impetuous as old nick are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen it comes from the great heat climate generally my wife is so to speak spanish half that is point of fact she could actually claim spanish nationality if she wanted having been born in technically spain ie gibraltar she has the spanish type quite dark regular brunette black i for one certainly believe climate accounts for character thats why i asked you if you wrote your poetry in italian the temperaments at the door stephen interposed with were very passionate about ten shillings roberto ruba roba sua quite so mr bloom dittoed then stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere we have the impetuosity of dante and the isosceles triangle miss portinari he fell in love with and leonardo and san tommaso mastino its in the blood mr bloom acceded at once all are washed in the blood of the sun coincidence i just happened to be in the kildare street museum 890 today shortly prior to our meeting if i can so call it and i was just looking at those antique statues there the splendid proportions of hips bosom you simply dont knock against those kind of women here an exception here and there handsome yes pretty in a way you find but what im talking about is the female form besides they have so little taste in dress most of them which greatly enhances a womans natural beauty no matter what you say rumpled stockings it may be possibly is a foible of mine but still its a thing i simply hate to see interest however was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea ships lost in a fog goo collisions with icebergs all that sort of thing shipahoy of course had his own say to say he had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon a kind of wind in the china seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing he declared stood to him or words to that effect a pious medal he had that saved him so then after that they drifted on to the wreck off daunts rock wreck of that illfated norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of henry campbell remembered it palme on booterstown strand that was the talk of the town that year albert william quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of 910 distinctive merit on the topic for the irish times breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror then someone said something about the case of the s s lady cairns of swansea run into by the mona which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck no aid was given her master the monas said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way she had no water it appears in her hold at this stage an incident happened it having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat let me cross your bows mate he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze he made tracks heavily slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left while he was in the act of getting his bearings mr bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ships rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and applying its nozz1e to his lips take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise the irrepressible bloom who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes could by straining just perceive him when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit gaping up at the piers and girders of the loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor evidently giving it a wide berth eased himself closer at hand the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank a hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who though now broken down and fast breaking up was none other in stern reality than the gumley aforesaid now practically on the parish rates given the temporary job by pat tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of morpheus a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool 100 pounds a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of and there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver he drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business ifa big if howeverhe had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality all meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in irish shipping coastwise and foreign as well which was all part and parcel of the same thing a palgrave murphy boat was put off the ways at alexandra basin the only launch that year right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called there were wrecks and wreckers the keeper said who was evidently au fait what he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in galway bay when the galway harbour scheme was mooted by a mr worthington or some name like that eh ask the then captain he advised them how much palmoil the british government gave him for that days work captain john lever of the lever line am i right skipper he queried of the sailor now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions that worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds mr blooms sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably which it was so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question anyhow in he rolled after his successful libationcumpotation introducing an atmosphere of drink into the soire boisterously trolling like a veritable son of a seacook the biscuits was as hard as brass and the beef as salt as lots wifes arse o johnny lever johnny lever o after which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided skinthegoat assuming he was he evidently with an axe to grind was airing his grievances in a forciblefeeble philippic anent the natural resources of ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of gods earth far and away superior to england with coal in large quantities six million pounds worth of pork exported every year ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by england levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact you could grow any mortal thing in irish soil he stated and there was that colonel everard down there in navan growing tobacco where would you find anywhere the like of irish bacon but a day of reckoning he stated crescendo with no uncertain voice thoroughly monopolising all the conversation was in store for mighty england despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes there would be a fall and the greatest fall in history the germans and the japs were going to have their little lookin he affirmed the boers were the beginning of the end brummagem england was toppling already and her downfall would be ireland her achilles heel which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of achilles the greek hero a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot his advice to every irishman was stay in the land of your birth and work for ireland and live for ireland ireland parnell said could not spare a single one of her sons silence all round marked the termination of his finale the impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed take a bit of doing boss retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism to which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view whos the best troops in the army the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated and the best jumpers and racers and the best admirals and generals weve got tell me that the irish for choice retorted the cabby like campbell facial blemishes apart thats right the old tarpaulin corroborated the irish catholic peasant hes the backbone of our empire you know jem mullins while allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire ours or his and considered no irishman worthy of his salt that served it then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter both needless to say appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didnt indulge in recriminations and come to blows from inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for rather concealed their strength than the opposite it was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if as time went on that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies equally relevant to the issue might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart another little interesting point the amours of whores and chummies to put it in common parlance reminded him irish soldiers had as often fought for england as against her more so in fact and now why so the scene between the pair of them the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been fitzharris the famous invincible and the other obviously bogus reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick supposing that is it was prearranged as the lookeron a student of the human soul if anything the others seeing least of the game and as for the lessee or keeper who probably wasnt the other person at all he b couldnt help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting there always being the offchance of a dannyman coming forward and turning queens evidence or kings now like denis or peter carey an idea he utterly repudiated quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle yet though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form he certainly did feel and no denying it while inwardly remaining what he was a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife cold steel with the courage of his political convictions though personally he would never be a party to any such thing off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south have her or swing for her when the husband frequently after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal he having had the pair watched inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that fitz nicknamed skinthegoat merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not if he was reliably informed actually party to the ambush which in point of fact was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on in any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend the pseudo skintheetcetera he had transparently outlived his welcome he ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high like actresses always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again generous to a fault of course temperamental no economising or any idea of the sort always snapping at the bone for the shadow so similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that mr johnny lever got rid of some l s d in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the old ireland tavern come back to erin and so on then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender he took umbrage at something or other that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared i let slip he called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively so i without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his god i mean christ was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality im not that was one for him a soft answer turns away wrath he hadnt a word to say for himself as everyone saw am i not right he turned a long you are wrong gaze on stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasnt all exactly ex quibus stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent their two or four eyes conversing christus or bloom his name is or after all any other secundum carnem of course mr b proceeded to stipulate you must look at both sides of the question it is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country they say our own distressful included has the government it deserves but with a little goodwill all round its all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality i resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form it never reaches anything or stops anything a revolution must come on the due instalments plan its a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular in the next house so to speak memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes war stephen assented between skinners alley and ormond market yes mr bloom thoroughly agreed entirely endorsing the remark that was overwhelmingly right and the whole world was full of that sort of thing you just took the words out of my mouth he said a hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldnt remotely all those wretched quarrels in his humble opinion stirring up bad blood from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything greed and jealousy people never knowing when to stop they accuse remarked he audibly he turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer to so as the others in case they jews he softly imparted in an aside in stephens ear are accused of ruining not a vestige of truth in it i can safely say history would you be surprised to learn proves up to the hilt spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and england prospered when cromwell an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for imported them why because they are imbued with the proper spirit they are practical and are proved to be so i dont want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are but in the economic not touching religion domain the priest spells poverty spain again you saw in the war compared with goahead america turks its in the dogma because if they didnt believe theyd go straight to heaven when they die theyd try to live better at least so i think thats the juggle on which the pps raise the wind on false pretences im he resumed with dramatic force as good an irishman as that rude person i told you about at the outset and i want to see everyone concluded he all creeds and classes pro rata having a comfortable tidysized income in no niggard fashion either something in the neighbourhood of 300 pounds per annum thats the vital issue at stake and its feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man at least thats my idea for what its worth i call that patriotism ubi patria as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in alma mater vita bene where you can live well the sense is if you work over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee listening to this synopsis of things in general stephen stared at nothing in particular he could hear of course all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didnt say the words the voice he heard said if you work count me out he managed to remark meaning work the eyes were surprised at this observation because as he the person who owned them pro tem observed or rather his voice speaking did all must work have to together i mean of course the other hastened to affirm work in the widest possible sense also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays thats work too important work after all from the little i know of you after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price you have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has what you both belong to ireland the brain and the brawn each is equally important you suspect stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh that i may be important because i belong to the faubourg saint patrice called ireland for short i would go a step farther mr bloom insinuated but i suspect stephen interrupted that ireland must be important because it belongs to me what belongs queried mr bloom bending fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension excuse me unfortunately i didnt catch the latter portion what was it you stephen patently crosstempered repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely adding 1170 we cant change the country let us change the subject at this pertinent suggestion mr bloom to change the subject looked down but in a quandary as he couldnt tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry the rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state probably the homelife to which mr b attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadnt been familiarised with the right sort of people with a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from paris the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister failing to throw much light on the subject however he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves for instance there was the case of ocallaghan for one the halfcrazy faddist respectably connected though of inadequate means with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper a fact and then the usual denouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got 1190 landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends after a strong hint to a blind horse from john mallon of lower castle yard so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act certain

heads running counter to morality such as the cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature a thing good mrs grundy as the law stands was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it ladies who like distinctive underclothing should and every welltailored man must trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two she unbuttoned his and then he untied her mind the pin whereas savages in the cannibal islands say at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental however reverting to the original there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps sheer force of natural genius that with brains sir for which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small intellectual stimulation as such was he felt from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind added to which was the coincidence of meeting discussion dance row old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type night loafers the whole galaxy of events all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth viz coalminers divers scavengers etc were very

lent itself to that sort of thing though as the event turned out the poor fool hadnt much reason to congratulate himself on his pick the forlorn hope guesswork it reduced itself to eventually there was every indication they would arrive at that he bloom said who the other whose hand by the way was hurt said one morning you would open the paper the cabman affirmed and read return of parnell he bet them what they liked a dublin fusilier was in that shelter one night and said he saw him in south africa pride it was killed him he ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after committee room no 15 until he was his old self again with noone to point a finger at him then they would all to a man have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his senses dead he wasnt simply absconded somewhere the coffin they brought over was full of stones he changed his name to de wet the boer general he made a mistake to fight the priests and so forth and so on all the same bloom properly so dubbed was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and even supposing he thought a return highly inadvisable all things considered something evidently riled them in his death either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothesafter a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the alice where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as fox and stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet whereas messrs so and so who though they werent even a patch on the former man ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between it certainly pointed a moral the idol with feet of clay and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging and the identical same with murderers you had to come back that haunting sense kind of drew you to show the understudy in the title rle how to he saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the insuppressible or was it united ireland a privilege he keenly appreciated and in point of fact handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said thank you excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip whats bred in the bone still as regards return you were a lucky dog if they didnt set the terrier at you directly you got back then a lot of shillyshally usually followed tom for and dick and harry against and then number one you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the tichborne case roger charles tichborne bella was the boats name to the best of his recollection he the heir went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in indian ink lord bellew was it as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then when got up to tally with the description given introduce himself with excuse me my name is so and so or some such commonplace remark a more prudent course as bloom said to the not over effusive in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him would have been to sound the lie of the land first that bitch that english whore did for him the shebeen proprietor commented she put the first nail in his coffin fine lump of a woman all the same the soidisant townclerk henry campbell remarked and plenty of her she loosened many a mans thighs i seen her picture in a barbers the husband was a captain or an officer ay skinthegoat amusingly added he was and a cottonball one this gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his entourage as regards bloom he without the faintest suspicion of a smile merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts to make matters worse were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings first it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into since their names were coupled though since he was her declared favourite where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops the fact namely that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel having gained admittance in the same fashion a fact the weeklies addicted to the lubric a little simply coined shoals of money out of whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man arriving on the scene strong to the verge of weakness falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties the usual sequel to bask in the loved ones smiles the eternal question of the life connubial needless to say cropped up can real love supposing there happens to be another chap in the case exist between married folk poser though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection carried away by a wave of folly a magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order as compared with the other military supernumerary that is who was just the usual everyday farewell my gallant captain kind of an individual in the light dragoons the 18th hussars to be accurate and inflammable doubtless the fallen leader that is not the other in his own peculiar way which she of course woman quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole his erstwhile staunch adherents and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled asss kick looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream and then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times why as he reflected irishtown strand a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since as it happened he went to reside on the north side north or south however it was just the wellknown case of hot passion pure and simple upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was spanish or half so types that wouldnt do things by halves passionate abandon of the south casting every shred of decency to the winds just bears out what i was saying he with glowing bosom said to stephen about blood and the sun and if i dont greatly mistake she was spanish too the king of spains daughter stephen answered adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you spanish onions and the first land called the deadman and from ramhead to scilly was so and so many was she bloom ejaculated surprised though not astonished by any means i never heard that rumour before possible especially there it was as she lived there so spain carefully avoiding a book in his pocket sweets of which reminded him by the by of that cap l street library book out of date he took out his pocketbook and turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he do you consider by the by he said thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table that a spanish type stephen obviously addressed looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom with more than vision of breasts her full lips parted and some perfect teeth standing near ostensibly with gravity a piano on the rest of which was in old madrid a ballad pretty in its way which was then all the vogue her the ladys eyes dark large looked at stephen about to smile about something to be admired lafayette of westmoreland street dublins premier photographic artist being responsible for the esthetic execution mrs bloom my wife the prima donna madam marion tweedy bloom indicated taken a few years since in or about ninety six very like her then beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his 1440 legal wife who he intimated was the accomplished daughter of major brian tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen as for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup she could without difficulty he said have posed for the ensemble not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the he dwelt being a bit of an artist in his spare time on the female form in general developmentally because as it so happened no later than that afternoon he had seen those grecian statues 1450 perfectly developed as works of art in the national museum marble could give the original shoulders back all the symmetry all the rest yes puritanisme it does though saint josephs sovereign thievery alors bandez figne toi trop whereas no photo could because it simply wasnt art in a word the spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow jack tars good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself her stage presence being frankly a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to but it was scarcely professional etiquette so though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering for sunshine after storm and he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves none the worse for wear however and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the others possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint in fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled good as new much better in fact with the starch out suppose she was gone when he i looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about ruby with met him pike hoses sic in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to lindley murray the vicinity of the young man he certainly relished educated distingu and impulsive into the bargain far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldnt think he had it in him yet you would besides he said the picture was handsome which say what you like it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter and why not an awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business how they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations when the thing ran its normal course became in due course intimate then the decree nisi and the kings proctor tries to show cause why and he failing to quash it nisi was made absolute but as for that the two misdemeanants wrapped up as they largely were in one another could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course he b enjoyed the distinction of being close to erins uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic fracas when the fallen leaders who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery leaders trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the insuppressible or no it was united ireland a by no means by the by appropriate appellative and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the obrienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribunes private morals though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she however was the first to perceive as those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chaps elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach fortunately not of a grave character his hat parnells a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and as a matter of strict history bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he as a matter of fact having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else whats bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mothers knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb saying thank you sir though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day history repeating itself with a difference after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave on the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest laughing 1530 immoderately pretending to understand everything the why and the wherefore and in reality not knowing their own minds it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy jones who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one anothers arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others he personally being of a sceptical bias believed and didnt make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument when neglecting her duties she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent the upshot being that her affections centred on another the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt it was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime in the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the interim ladies society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts not that he wanted in the smallest to pump stephen about miss ferguson who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to irishtown so early in the morning as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ways and flowers and chocs to think of him house and homeless rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother was really too bad at his age the queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the others senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or failing that the homely humpty dumpty boiled at what oclock did you dine he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face some time yesterday stephen said yesterday exclaimed bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow friday ah you mean its after twelve the day before yesterday stephen said improving on himself literally astounded at this piece of intelligence bloom reflected though they didnt see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling so to speak in the one train of thought at his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentary honours in the buckshot foster days he too recollected in retrospect which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas for instance when the evicted tenants question then at its first inception bulked largely in peoples mind though it goes without saying not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums some of which wouldnt exactly hold water he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion a partiality however which realising his mistake he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernans so that he though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals be it repeated departed from his customary habit to give him metaphorically one in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows chiefly destruction of the fittest in a word anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons getting on for one as it was it was high time to be retiring for the night the crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue somebody having a temper of her own sometimes and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog breed unknown with a lame paw not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too to ontario terrace as he very distinctly remembered having been there so to speak on the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the sandymount or sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity all things considered his initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway for one thing he mightnt what you call jump at the idea if approached and what mostly worried him was he didnt know how to lead up to it or word it exactly supposing he did entertain the proposal as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe if found suitable at all events he wound up by concluding eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent a cup of eppss cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up a move had to be made because that merry old soul the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot didnt appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved queenstown and it was highly likely some spongers bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal characters whereabouts for a few days to come alternately racking their feelings the mermaids with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybodys bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address as mr algebra remarks passim at the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew people could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep the most vulnerable point too of tender achilles your god was a jew because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from carrickonshannon or

things over my diggings are quite close in the vicinity you cant drink that stuff do you like cocoa wait ill just pay this lot the best plan clearly being to clear out the remainder being plain sailing he beckoned while prudently pocketing the photo to the keeper of the shanty who didnt seem to yes thats the best he assured stephen to whom for the matter of that brazen head or him or anywhere else was all more or less all kinds of utopian plans were flashing through his bs busy brain education the genuine article literature journalism prize titbits up to date billing concert tours in english watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres turning money away duets in italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it and a slice of luck an opening was all was wanted because he more than suspected he had his fathers voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well by the way no harm to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to the cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy earl cadogan had presided at the cabdrivers association dinner in london somewhere silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir anthony macdonnell had left euston for the chief secretarys lodge or words to that effect to which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why give us a squint at that literature grandfather the ancient mariner put in manifesting some natural impatience and welcome answered the elderly party thus addressed the sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears are you bad in the eyes the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried why answered the seafarer with the tartan beard who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as i uses goggles reading sand in the red sea done that one time i could read a book in the dark manner of speaking the arabian nights entertainment was my favourite and red as a rose is she hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon lord only knows what found drowned or the exploits of king willow iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for notts during which time completely regardless of ire the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions that is to say either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark to cut a long story short bloom grasping the situation was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming making a grand total of fourpence the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers literally the last of the mohicans he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures coffee 2d confectionery do and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way as wetherup used to remark come he counselled to close the sance seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the lite society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente stephen who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out paused at the for a moment the door one thing i never understood he said to be original on the spur of the moment why they put tables upside down at night i mean chairs upside down on the tables in cafes to which impromptu the neverfailing bloom replied without a moments hesitation saying straight off to sweep the floor in the morning so saying he skipped around nimbly considering frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companions right a habit of his by the bye his right side being in classical idiom his tender achilles the night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though stephen was a bit weak on his pins it will the air do you good bloom said meaning also the walk in a moment the only thing is to walk then youll feel a different man come its not far lean on me accordingly he passed his left arm in stephens right and led him on accordingly yes stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him sinewless and wobbly and all that anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones brazier etc where the municipal supernumerary ex gumley was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of murphy as the adage has it dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new and apropos of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings so they turned on to chatting about music a form of art for which bloom as a pure amateur possessed the greatest love as they made tracks arm in arm across beresford place wagnerian music though confessedly grand in its way was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to follow at the first gooff but the music of mercadantes huguenots meyerbeers seven last words on the cross and mozarts twelfth mass he simply revelled in the gloria in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as such literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat he infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those moody and sankey hymns or bid me to live and i will live thy protestant to be he also yielded to none in his admiration of rossinis stabat mater a work simply abounding in immortal numbers in which his wife madam marion tweedy made a hit a veritable sensation he might safely say greatly adding to her other laureis and putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers church in upper gardiner street the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos or virtuosi rather there was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore on the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the don giovanni description and martha a gem in its line he had a penchant though with only a surface knowledge for the severe classical school such as mendelssohn and talking of that taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites he mentioned par excellence lionels air in martha mappari which curiously enough he had heard or overheard to be more accurate on yesterday a privilege he keenly appreciated from the lips of stephens respected father sung to perfection a study of the number in fact which made all the others take a back seat stephen in reply to a politely put query said he didnt sing it but launched out into praises of shakespeares songs at least of in or about that period the lutenist dowland who lived in fetter lane near gerard the herbalist who anno ludendo hausi doulandus an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from mr arnold dolmetsch whom b did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar for sixtyfive guineas and farnaby and son with their dux and comes conceits and byrd william who played the virginals he said in the queens chapel or anywhere else he found them and one tomkins who made toys or airs and john bull on the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse dragging a sweeper paced on the paven ground brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and john bull he inquired if it was john bull the political celebrity of that ilk as it struck him the two identical names as a striking coincidence by the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn which perceiving bloom who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the others sleeve gently jocosely remarking our lives are in peril tonight beware of the steamroller they thereupon stopped bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker a hipshaker a blackbuttocker a taildangler a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch busy with his thoughts but such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadnt a lump of sugar but as he wisely reflected you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up he was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse without a second care in the world but even a dog he reflected take that mongrel in barney kiernans of the same size would be a holy horror to face but it was no animals fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel ship of the desert distilling grapes into potheen in his hump nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees whale with a harpoon hairpin alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke chalk a circle for a rooster tiger my eagle eye these timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from stephens words while the ship of the street was manoeuvring and stephen went on about the highly interesting old whats this i was saying ah yes my wife he intimated plunging in medias res would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind he looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of stephen image of his mother which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built still supposing he had his fathers gift as he more than suspected it opened up new vistas in his mind such as lady fingalls irish industries concert on the preceding monday and aristocracy in general exquisite variations he was now describing on an air youth here has end by jans pieter sweelinck a dutchman of amsterdam where the frows come from even more he liked an old german song of johannes jeep about the clear sea and the voices of sirens sweet murderers of men which boggled bloom a bit von der sirenen listigkeit tun die poeten dichten these opening bars he sang and translated extempore bloom nodding said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did a phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that the rarest of boons which bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out could easily if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an entre into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of b a a huge ad in its way and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he a youthful tyro insocietys sartorial niceties hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you it was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the christmas season for choice causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation cases of which as he happened to know were on recordin fact without giving the show away he himself once upon a time if he cared to could easily have added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at going hand in hand with his tuition fees not he parenthesised that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time but a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped besides though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree original music like that different from the conventional rut would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for dublins musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by ivan st austell and hilton st just and their genus omne yes beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the citys esteem where he could command a stiff figure and booking ahead give a grand concert for the patrons of the king street house given a backerup if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs so to speak a big if however with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often trippedup a too much fted prince of good fellows and it need not detract from the other by one iota as being his own master he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone in fact he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort hung on to him at all the horse was just then and later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed bloom did without anyway prying into his private affairs on the fools step in where angels principle advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who he noticed was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present deprecate him or whatever you like to call it which in blooms humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a persons character no pun intended the horse having reached the end of his tether so to speak halted and rearing high a proud feathering tail added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish three smoking globes of turds slowly three times one after another from a full crupper he mired and humanely his driver waited till he or she had ended patient in his scythed car side by side bloom profiting by the contretemps with stephen passed through the gap of the chains divided by the upright and stepping over a strand of mire went across towards gardiner street lower stephen singing more boldly but not loudly the end of the ballad und alle schiffe brcken the driver never said a word good bad or indifferent but merely watched the two figures as he sat on his lowbacked car both black one full one lean walk towards the railway bridge to be married by father maher as they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their ttette which of course he was utterly out of about sirens enemies of mans reason mingled with a number of other topics of the same category usurpers historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldnt possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower gardiner street and looked after their lowbacked car what parallel courses did bloom and stephen follow returning starting united both at normal walking pace from beresford place they followed in the order named lower and middle gardiner streets and mountjoy square west then at reduced pace each bearing left gardiners place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of temple street then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt bearing right temple street north as far as hardwicke place approaching disparate at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before georges church diametrically the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary music literature

dustbuckets the roman catholic church ecclesiastical celibacy the irish nation jesuit education careers the study of medicine the past day the maleficent influence of the presabbath stephens collapse did bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious national social and ethical doctrines both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism were their views on some points divergent stephen dissented openly from blooms views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while bloom dissented tacitly from stephens views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature bloom assented covertly to stephens rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the irish nation to christianity from druidism by patrick son of calpornus son of potitus son of odyssus sent by pope celestine i in the year 432 in the reign of leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of cormac macart died 266 ad suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at sletty and interred at rossnaree the collapse which bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud perceived by both from two different points of observation sandycove and dublin at first no bigger than a womans hand was there one point on which their views were equal and negative the influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees had bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past in 1884 with owen goldberg and cecil turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between longwood avenue and leonards corner and leonards corner and synge street and synge street and bloomfield avenue in 1885 with percy apjohn in the evenings reclined against the wall between gibraltar villa and bloomfield house in crumlin barony of uppercross in 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps in front parlours in third class railway carriages of suburban lines in 1888 frequently with major brian tweedy and his daughter miss marion tweedy together and separately on the lounge in matthew dillons house in roundtown once in 1892 and once in 1893 with julius juda mastiansky on both occasions in the parlour of his blooms house in lombard street west what reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884 1885 1886 1888 1892 1893 1904 did bloom make before their arrival at their destination he reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations as in what ways from inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received existence with existence he was with any as any with any from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived what act did bloom make on their arrival at their destination at the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers number 7 eccles street he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey was it there it was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding why was he doubly irritated because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget what were then the alternatives before the premeditatedly respectively and inadvertently keyless couple to enter or not to enter to knock or not to knock blooms decision a stratagem resting his feet on the dwarf wall he climbed over the area railings compressed his hat on his head grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and

ignited a lucifer match by friction set free inflammable coal gas by turningon the ventcock lit a high flame which by regulating he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle what discrete succession of images did stephen meanwhile perceive reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 cp a man lighting a candle of 1 cp a man removing in turn each of his two boots a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle did the man reappear elsewhere after a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor the halldoor turned gradually on its hinges in the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat with his candle did stephen obey his sign yes entering softly he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the mans back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of blooms house what did bloom do he extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone one for stephen with its back to the area window the other for himself when necessary knelt on one knee composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of messrs flower and mdonald of 14 dolier street kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air of what similar apparitions did stephen think of others elsewhere in other times who kneeling on one knee or on two had kindled fires for him of

raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies grey hose with lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction what did bloom see on the range on the right smaller hob a blue enamelled saucepan on the left larger hob a black iron kettle what did bloom do at the range he removed the saucepan to the left hob rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow did it flow yes from roundwood reservoir in county wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2400 million gallons percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of

lemonflavoured soap to which paper still adhered bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them face and hands in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller what reason did stephen give for declining blooms offer that he was hydrophobe hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water his last bath having taken place in the month of october of the preceding year disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal distrusting aquacities of thought and language what impeded bloom from giving stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape stomach and thenar or sole of foot the incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius what additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress dietary concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon salt ling and butter the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest confidence in himself an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation what concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire the phenomenon of ebullition fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous

temperature of the water from normal to boiling point a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50 degrees to 212 degrees fahrenheit what announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature a double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously for what personal purpose could bloom have applied the water so boiled to shave himself what advantages attended shaving by night a softer beard a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours quiet reflections upon the course of the day a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises premonitions and perturbations a clattered milkcan a postmans double knock a paper read reread while lathering relathering the same spot a shock a shoot with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be done why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand what quality did it his

heliotherapy psychophysicotherapeutics osteopathic surgery what lay under exposure on the lower middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser opened by bloom on the lower shelf five vertical

corrugated his brow reminiscences of coincidences truth stranger than fiction preindicative of the result of the gold cup flat handicap the official and definitive result of which he had read in the evening telegraph late pink edition in the cabmans shelter at butt bridge where had previous intimations of the result effected or projected been received by him in bernard kiernans licensed premises

towards the oriental edifice of the turkish and warm baths 11 leinster street with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race graven in the language of prediction what qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations the difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation his mood he had not risked he did not expect he had not been disappointed he was satisfied what satisfied him to have sustained no positive loss to have brought a positive gain to others light to the gentiles how did bloom prepare a collation for a gentile he poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls four in all of eppss soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed what supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation crown derby presented to him by his only daughter millicent milly he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and in reduced measure to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife marion molly was

condition who drank more quickly bloom having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted three sips to his opponents one six to two nine to three what cerebration accompanied his frequentative act concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of william shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life had he found their solution in spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages aided by a glossary he had derived imperfect conviction from the text the answers not bearing in all points what lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him potential poet at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the

so condescend then please place at the end the name of yours truly l bloom did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him name age race creed what anagrams had he made on his

february 1888 poets oft have sung in rhyme of music sweet their praise divine let them hymn it nine times nine dearer far than song or wine you are mine the world is mine what had prevented him from completing a topical song music by r g johnston on the events of the past or fixtures for the actual years entitled if brian boru could but come back and see old dublin now commissioned by michael

supervision of mrs michael gunn ballets by jessie noir harlequinade by thomas otto and sung by nelly bouverist principal girl firstly oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest the anticipated diamond jubilee of queen victoria born 1820 acceded 1837 and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market secondly apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of york real and of his majesty king brian boru imaginary thirdly a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the grand lyric hall on burgh quay and the theatre royal in hawkins street fourthly distraction resultant from compassion for nelly bouverists nonintellectual nonpolitical nontopical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by nelly bouverists revelations of white articles of nonintellectual nonpolitical nontopical underclothing while she nelly bouverist was in the articles fifthly the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from everybodys book of jokes 1000 pages and a laugh in every one sixthly the rhymes homophonous and cacophonous associated with the names of the new lord mayor daniel tallon the new high sheriff thomas pile and the new solicitorgeneral dunbar plunket barton what relation existed between their ages 16 years before in 1888 when bloom was of stephens present age stephen was 6 16 years after in 1920 when stephen would be of blooms present age bloom would be 54 in 1936 when bloom would be 70 and stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 12 to 13 12 the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable conceiving that to be possible till then 1904 when stephen was 22 bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when stephen would be 38 as bloom then was bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 bloom being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714 would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age that of methusalah 969 years while if stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 ad bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83300 years having been obliged to have been born in the year 81396 bc what events might nullify these calculations the cessation of existence of both or either the inauguration of a new era or calendar the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species inevitable but impredictable how many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance two the first in the lilacgarden of matthew dillons house medina villa kimmage road roundtown in 1887 in the company of stephens mother stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation the second in the coffeeroom of breslins hotel on a rainy sunday in the january of 1892 in the company of stephens father and stephens granduncle stephen being then 5 years older did bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father very gratefully with grateful appreciation with sincere appreciative gratitude in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret he declined did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them mrs riordan dante a widow of independent means had resided in the house of stephens parents from 1 september 1888 to 29 december 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892 1893 and 1894 in the city arms hotel owned by elizabeth odowd of 54 prussia street where during parts of the years 1893 and 1894 she had been a constant informant of bloom who resided also in the same hotel being at that time a clerk in the employment of joseph cuffe of 5 smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent dublin cattle market on the north circular road had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her he had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings an infirm widow of independent if limited means in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the north circular road opposite mr gavin lows place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres hackney carriages tandems private and hired landaus dogcarts ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the phoenix park and vice versa why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without pedestrians quadrupeds velocipedes vehicles passing slowly quickly evenly round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe what distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased the older her bezique cards and counters her skye terrier her suppositious wealth her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness the younger her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the immaculate conception her green and maroon brushes for charles stewart parnell and for michael davitt her tissue papers were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable the indoor exercises formerly intermittently practised subsequently abandoned prescribed in eugen sandows physical strength and how to obtain it which designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility had any special agility been his in earlier youth though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a high school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles did either openly allude to their racial difference neither what reduced to their simplest reciprocal form were blooms thoughts about stephens thoughts about bloom and about stephens thoughts about blooms thoughts about stephen he thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not what the enclosures of reticence removed were their respective parentages bloom only born male transubstantial heir of rudolf virag subsequently rudolph bloom of szombathely vienna budapest milan london and dublin and of ellen higgins second daughter of julius higgins born karoly and fanny higgins born hegarty stephen eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of simon dedalus of cork and dublin and of mary daughter of richard and christina goulding born grier had bloom

reverend charles malone c c alone in the church of the three patrons rathgar did they find their educational careers similar substituting stephen for bloom stoom would have passed successively through a dames school and the high school substituting bloom for stephen blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory junior middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation first arts second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university why did bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to stephen or by stephen to him what two temperaments did they individually represent the scientific the artistic what proofs did bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied rather than towards pure science certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary for example the aeronautic parachute the reflecting telescope the spiral corkscrew the safety pin the mineral water siphon the canal lock with winch and sluice the suction pump were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten yes rendering obsolete popguns elastic airbladders games of hazard catapults they comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from aries to pisces miniature mechanical orreries arithmetical gelatine lozenges geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits globemap playing balls historically costumed dolls what also stimulated him in his cogitations the financial

example did he adduce to induce stephen to deduce that originality though producing its own reward does not invariably conduce to success his own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated

queens hotel queens hotel queens hotel queens ho what suggested scene was then reconstructed by bloom the queens hotel ennis county clare where rudolph bloom rudolf virag died on the evening of the 27

drapery store of james cullen 4 main street ennis did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition coincidence did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see he preferred himself to see anothers face and listen to anothers words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him described by the narrator as a pisgah sight of palestine or the parable of the plums it with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication to which add

covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were greek and irish and hebrew characters she had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in canada quebec she understood little of political complications internal or balance of power external in calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid after completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment exposed to the corrosive action of

of all perpendicular arms of all balances proved true by construction the counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person proved true by experiment how had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance variously by leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page by assuming in her when alluding explanatorily latent knowledge by open ridicule

consequence of defective mnemotechnic how did the chanter compensate for this deficiency by a periphrastic version of the general text in what common study did their mutual reflections merge the increasing simplification traceable from the egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the greek and roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform

harry hughes and his schoolfellows all went out for to play ball and the very first ball little harry hughes played he drove it oer the jews garden wall and the very second ball little harry hughes

student faculty and year not stated did that first division portending a second division afflict him less than he had imagined more than he had hoped what second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly if differently a temporary departure of his cat why similarly why differently similarly because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male mullingar student or of a healing herb valerian differently because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation in other respects were their differences similar in passivity in economy in the

a thousandth part what proposal did bloom diambulist father of milly somnambulist make to stephen noctambulist to pass in repose the hours intervening between thursday proper and friday normal on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess what various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation for the guest security of domicile and seclusion of study for the host rejuvenation of intelligence vicarious satisfaction for the hostess disintegration of obsession acquisition of correct italian pronunciation why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jews daughter because the way to daughter led through mother the way to mother through daughter to what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer if he had known the late mrs emily sinico accidentally killed at sydney parade railway station 14 october 1903 what inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host a statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of mrs mary dedalus born goulding 26 june 1903 vigil of the

maternity hospital 29 30 and 31 holles street a public garden the vicinity of a place of worship a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences if both speakers were resident in different places what rendered problematic for bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions the irreparability of the past once at a performance of albert henglers circus in the rotunda rutland square dublin an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where bloom solitary was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he bloom was his the clowns papa the imprevidibility of the future once in the summer of 1898 he bloom had marked a florin 2 with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it m payment of an account due to and received by j and t davy family grocers 1 charlemont mall grand canal for circulation on the waters of civic finance for possible circuitous or direct return was the clown blooms son no had blooms coin returned never why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity he believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible eliminating these conditions there remained the generic conditions imposed by natural as distinct from human law as integral parts of the human whole the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence the agonies of birth and death the monotonous menstruation of simian and particularly human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause inevitable accidents at sea in mines and factories certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations innate lunacy and congenital criminality decimating epidemics catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions the fact of vital growth through convulsions of metamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decay why did he desist from speculation because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed did stephen participate in his dejection he affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void was this affirmation apprehended by bloom not verbally substantially what comforted his misapprehension that as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void in what order of precedence with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected lighted candle in stick borne by bloom diaconal hat on ashplant borne by stephen with what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm the 113th modus peregrinus in exitu israel de egypto domus jacob de populo barbaro what did each do at the door of egress bloom set the candlestick on the floor stephen put the hat on his head for what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress for a cat what spectacle confronted them when they first the host then the guest emerged silently doubly dark from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden the heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit with what meditations did bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations meditations of evolution increasingly vaster of the moon invisible in incipient lunation approaching perigee of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth of sirius alpha in canis maior 10 lightyears 57000000000000 miles distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet of arcturus of the precession of equinoxes of orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained of moribund and of nascent new stars such as nova in 1901 of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years threescore and ten of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth beneath removable stones in hives and mounds of microbes germs bacteria bacilli spermatozoa of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies each in continuity its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till if the progress were carried far enough nought nowhere was never reached why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places eg the 9th power of the 9th power of 9 that the result having been obtained 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of india paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units tens hundreds thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions tens of millions hundreds of millions billions the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race given in species and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer easier of solution of a different order of difficulty conscious that the human organism normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage impeded respiration and vertigo when proposing this problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under martian mercurial veneral jovian saturnian neptunian or uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity and the problem of possible redemption the minor was proved by the

from the constellation of the corona septentrionalis about the period of the birth of leopold bloom and of other stars of presumably similar origin which had effectively or presumably appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of andromeda about the period of the birth of stephen dedalus and in and from the constellation of auriga some years after the birth and death of rudolph bloom

wind transit of shadow taciturnity of winged creatures emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals persistence of infernal light obscurity of terrestrial waters pallor of human beings his blooms logical conclusion having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error that it was not a heaventree not a heavengrot not a heavenbeast not a heavenman that it was a utopia there being no known method from the known to the unknown an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space remobilised in air a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters it seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy the lake of dreams the sea of rains the gulf of dews the ocean of fecundity what special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations her nocturnal predominance her satellitic dependence her luminary reflection her constancy under all her phases rising and setting by her appointed times waxing and waning the forced invariability of her aspect her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation her potency over effluent and refluent waters her power to enamour to mortify to invest with beauty to render insane to incite to and aid delinquency the tranquil inscrutability of her visage the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity her omens of tempest and of calm the stimulation of her light her motion and her presence the admonition of her craters her arid seas her silence her splendour when visible her attraction when invisible what visible luminous sign attracted blooms who attracted stephens gaze in the second storey rere of his blooms house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by frank ohara window blind curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer 16 aungier street how did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person his wife marion molly bloom denoted by a visible splendid sign a lamp with indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations with subdued affection and admiration with description with impediment with suggestion both then were silent silent each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces were they indefinitely inactive at stephens suggestion at blooms instigation both first stephen then bloom in penumbra urinated their sides contiguous their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition their gazes first blooms then stephens elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow similarly the trajectories of their first sequent then simultaneous urinations were dissimilar blooms longer less irruent in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at high school 1880 had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution 210 scholars stephens higher more sibilant who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure what different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other to bloom the problems of irritability tumescence rigidity reactivity dimension sanitariness pilosity to stephen the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of jesus circumcised i january holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce the carnal bridal ring of the holy roman catholic apostolic church conserved in calcata were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails what celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed a star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from vega in the lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the tress of berenice towards the zodiacal sign of leo how did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer by inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left withdrawing a bolt from its staple pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress how did they take leave one of the other in separation standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base the lines of their valedictory arms meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles what sound accompanied the union of their tangent the disunion of their respectively centrifugal and centripetal hands the sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of saint george what echoes of that sound were by both and each heard by stephen liliata rutilantium turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat by bloom heigho heigho heigho heigho where were the several members of the company which with bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from sandymount in the south to glasnevin in the north martin cunningham in bed jack power in bed simon dedalus in bed ned lambert in bed tom kernan in bed joe hynes in bed john henry menton in bed bernard corrigan in bed patsy dignam in bed paddy dignam in the grave alone what did bloom hear the double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth the double vibration of a jews harp in the resonant lane alone what did bloom feel the cold of interstellar space thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of fahrenheit centigrade or

apjohn killed in action modder river philip gilligan phthisis jervis street hospital matthew f kane accidental drowning dublin bay philip moisel pyemia heytesbury street michael hart phthisis mater misericordiae hospital patrick dignam apoplexy sandymount what prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain the disparition of three final stars the diffusion of daybreak the apparition of a new solar disk had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena once in 1887 after a protracted performance of charades in the house of luke doyle kimmage he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon seated on a wall his gaze turned in the direction of mizrach the east he remembered the initial paraphenomena more active air a matutinal distant cock ecclesiastical clocks at various points avine music the isolated tread of an early wayfarer the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon did he remain with deep inspiration he returned retraversing the garden reentering the passage reclosing the door with brief suspiration he reassumed the candle reascended the stairs reapproached the door of the front room hallfloor and reentered what suddenly arrested his ingress the right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture a sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled union jack an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa the walnut sideboard a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table describe them one a squat stuffed easychair with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere which repelled in recoil had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration the other a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves placed directly opposite the former its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush what significances attached to these two chairs significances of similitude of posture of symbolism of circumstantial evidence of testimonial supermanence what occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard a vertical piano cadby with exposed keyboard its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes its musicrest supporting the music in the key of g natural for voice and piano of loves old sweet song words by g clifton bingham composed by j l molloy sung by madam antoinette sterling open at the last page with the final indications ad libitum forte pedal animato sustained pedal ritirando close with what sensations did bloom contemplate in rotation these objects with strain elevating a candlestick with pain feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence with attention focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active with solicitation bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe with amusement remembering dr malachi mulligans scheme of colour containing the gradation of green with pleasure repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration his next proceeding from an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone one inch in height placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus illustrated entitled agendath netaim unfolded the same examined it superficially rolled it into a thin cylinder ignited it in the candleflame applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion what followed this operation the truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense what homothetic objects other than the candlestick stood on the mantelpiece a timepiece of striated connemara marble stopped at the hour of 446 am on the 21 march 1896 matrimonial gift of matthew dillon a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade matrimonial gift of luke and caroline doyle an embalmed owl matrimonial gift of alderman john hooper what interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and bloom in the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl before the mirror the matrimonial gift of alderman john hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded bloom while bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of luke and caroline doyle what composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention the image of a solitary ipsorelative mutable aliorelative man why solitary ipsorelative brothers and sisters had he none yet that mans father was his grandfathers son why mutable aliorelative from infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix from maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator what final

because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the city arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot mrs riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first god help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them i suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice i hope ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about mr riordan here and mr riordan there i suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still i like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but i suppose id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was o tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf mountain the day i wore that dress miss stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides i hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing i was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it hynes kept me who did i meet ah yes i met do you remember menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface i saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at pooles myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes i ever met and thats called a solicitor only for i hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as i do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when i came into the front room to show him dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that i care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though id like to find out so long as i dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that mary we had in ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice i had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when i found the long hair on his coat without that one when i went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on christmas day if you please o no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 26 per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but i was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof o yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but i told her what i thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her i wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters i found in her room the friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when i gave her her weeks notice i saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt i gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house i couldnt even touch him if i thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the w c too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the tolka in my hand there steals another i just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young may moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said im dining out and going to the gaiety though im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case god knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless i paid some nicelooking boy to do it since i cant do it myself a young boy would like me id confuse him a little alone with him if we were id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him i know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes i would because i told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when i was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german emperor is it yes imagine im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself i wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then i hate that confession when i used to go to father corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and i said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes o lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it i forget no father and i always think of the real father what did he want to know for when i already confessed it to god he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always i wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar i wonder did he know me in the box i could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to h h the pope for a penance i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though i laughed im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking of his fathers i wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am i in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats i tasted once with my finger dipped out of that american that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because i felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment i popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up god be merciful to us i thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when i blessed myself and said a hail mary like those awful thunderbolts in gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no god what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle i lit that evening in whitefriars street chapel for the month of may see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when i lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has i thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after i took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters i think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no i never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye i had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when i made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time i let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what i went through with milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and mina purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it jesusjack the child is a black the last time i was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or i dont know what supposing i risked having another not off him though still if he was married im sure hed have a fine strong child but i dont know poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly i suppose it was meeting josie powell and the funeral and thinking about me and boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good i know they were spooning a bit when i came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of georgina simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about our lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything i was fuming with myself after for giving in only for i knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said he was he annoyed me so much i couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside i often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician i could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that i pretended i had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and i said over to floey and he made me the present of byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that i could quite easily get him to make it up any time i know how id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere id know if he refused to eat the onions i know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out i kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that i wouldnt so much mind id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though i had the devils own job to get it out of him though i liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen i was rolling the potato cake theres something i want to say to you only for i put him off letting on i was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case i let out too much the night before talking of dreams so i didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when i said i washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him i dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord byron i said i liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day i was in fits of laughing with the giggles i couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair i had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married i wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she must have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me o yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for 10000 pounds for a postcard u p up o sweetheart may wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that id rather die 20 times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way i do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that mrs maybrick that poisoned her husband for what i wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it i wonder why they call it that if i asked him hed say its from the greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged o she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when i was in the d b c with poldy laughing and trying to listen i was waggling my foot we both ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter i saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when i stood up and asked the girl where it was what do i care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one i did i forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that i never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the irish times lost in the ladies lavatory d b c dame street finder return to mrs marion bloom and i saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when i looked back and i went there for tea 2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because i was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if i only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet i dont like my foot so much still i made him spend once with my foot the night after goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung i could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that i what did he say i could give 9 points in 10 to katty lanner and beat her what does that mean i asked him i forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the lucan dairy thats so polite i think i saw his face before somewhere i noticed him when i was tasting the butter so i took my time bartell darcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after i sang gounods ave maria what are we waiting for o my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him i liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that i dont see anything so terrible about it ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was lo times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and i had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so i let him keep it as if i forgot it to think of me when i saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when milly and i were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain i saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going i could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so i halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till i took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till i promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket o maria santisima he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat i had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if i didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so i lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way i used to gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public i was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say i left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have i offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw i wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool henny doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades i hate an unlucky man and if i knew what it meant of course i had to say no for form sake dont understand you i said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in gibraltar with that word i couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day i liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then i wrote the night he kissed my heart at dolphins barn i couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like gardner i hope hell come on monday as he said at the same time four i hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface goodwin called about the concert in lombard street and i just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor i had to say im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today i thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and i was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when i knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was l4 after 3 when i saw the 2 dedalus girls coming from school i never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly id want to get it looked after when i threw the penny to that lame sailor for england home and beauty when i was whistling there is a charming girl i love and i hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to belfast just as well he has to go to ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed i couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the mallow concert at maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to cork i suppose that was done out of revenge on him o i love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions i wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well o i suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to howth id like to find out something about him l or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose i never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert i sang at where its over a year ago when was it st teresas hall clarendon st little chits of missies they have now singing kathleen kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for lord roberts when i had the map of it all and poldy not irish enough was it him managed it this time i wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the stabat mater by going around saying he was putting lead kindly light to music i put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them sinner fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all i can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott i hate the mention of their politics after the war that pretoria and ladysmith and bloemfontein where gardner lieut stanley g 8th bn 2nd east lancs rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me im sure he was brave too he said i was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and i so hot as i never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom paul and the rest of the other old krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad i love to see a regiment pass in review the first time i saw the spanish cavalry at la roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the 15 acres the black watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of wales own or the lancers o the lancers theyre grand or the dublins that won tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in belfast after what i gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things i must buy a mothball like i had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married o let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot i care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if i could find out whether he likes me i looked a bit washy of course when i looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way mrs mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly well off i know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes val dillon that big heathen i first noticed him at dessert when i was cracking the nuts with my teeth i wished i could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for i didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too i wish i had some i could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when i was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on i want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but i dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all i think didnt he say yes and half the girls in gibraltar never wore them either naked as god made them that andalusian singing her manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear i could have brought them back to lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets id want advertised cheap in the gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one i have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line 116 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am i getting too fond of it the last they sent from orourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink god spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or i must do a few breathing exercises i wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much i have the violet pair i wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first o no there was the face lotion i finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new i told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it god only knows whether he did after all i said to him 111 know by the bottle anyway if not i suppose 111 only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet i thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6 in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when i get it ill lash it around i tell you in fine style i always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if i buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes how much were they ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the 4 years more i have of life up to 35 no im what am i at all 111 be 33 in september will i what o well look at that mrs galbraith shes much older than me i saw her when i was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like kitty oshea in grantham street 1st thing i did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity i only got to know her the day before we left and that mrs langtry the jersey lily the prince of wales was in love with i suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of master francois somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her ae as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant i hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that ruby and fair tyrants he brought me that twice i remember when i came to page 5 o the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant jesus in the crib at inchicore in the blessed virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and i thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured h r h he was in gibraltar the year i was born i bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then i wouldnt be here as i am he ought to chuck that freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today i wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in mr cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up i could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly mrs bloom only i felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that i lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again i bought it simply to please him i knew it was no good by the finish pity i changed my mind of going to todd and bums as i said and not lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash i hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if i went by his advices every blessed hat i put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in grafton street i had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but i stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but i could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case im extremely sorry mrs bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife i just half smiled i know my chest was out that way at the door when he said im extremely sorry and im sure you were yes i think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them i had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing ill get him to keep that up and ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when i was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the queens own they were a nice lot its well the surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly i passed outside the mens greenhouse near the harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was i of the 7 wonders of the world o and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with poldy after the comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery i went into r of them it was so biting cold i couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero i tried to draw a picture of it before i tore it up like a sausage or something i wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said i could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in holles street when he lost the job in helys and i was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would i be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or im a little like that dirty bitch in that spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that i asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple i had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you i had a great breast of milk with milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said i could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no 28 with the citrons penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for i snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor brady to give me the belladonna prescription i had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything i declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if i only could remember the i half of the things and write a book out of it the works of master poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant i had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman i can feel his mouth o lord i must stretch myself i wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that i feel all fire inside me or if i could dream it when he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger i was coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him i had to hug him after o lord i wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank god some of them want you to be so nice about it i noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk i gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute thursday friday one saturday two sunday three o lord i cant wait till monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all

very careless and threw the rest of them up in the w c 111 get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last januarys paper and all those old overcoats i bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep i thought it was going to get like gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their 3 rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend mrs stanhope sent me from the b marche paris what a shame my dearest doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you i sent the little present have just had a jolly warm bath and feel a very clean dog now enjoyed it wogger she called him wogger wd give anything to be back in gib and hear you sing waiting and in old madrid

grove with love yrs affly hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at la linea when that matador gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why i was afraid when that other ferocious old bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2 things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses i never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever i suppose theyre dead long ago the 2 of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old i made the scones of course i had everything all to myself then a girl hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when i put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was i then the night of the storm i slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the alameda esplanade when i was with father and captain grove i looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met i felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing i remember after when i looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like thomas in the shadow of ashlydyat i had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose i didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but i could have stopped it in time she gave me the moonstone to read that was the first i read of wilkie collins east lynne i read and the shadow of ashlydyat mrs henry wood henry dunbar by that other woman i lent him afterwards with mulveys photo in it so as he see i wasnt without and lord lytton eugene aram molly bawn she gave me by mrs hungerford on account of the name i dont like books with a molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it o this blanket is too heavy on me thats better i havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better i used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when i stood up they were so fattish and firm when i got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets i couldnt read a line lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never i remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious i had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt i cry yes i believe i did or near it my lips were taittering when i said goodbye she had a gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went i was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general ulysses grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain groves and father talking about rorkes drift and plevna and sir garnet wolseley and gordon at khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when i was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along i suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few i posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes i could fight with my nails listening to that old arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriments on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in holles street the nurse was after when i put on my gloves and hat at the window to show i was going out not a notion what i meant arent they thick never understand what you say even youd want to print it up on a big poster for them

matter they have it all in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the city arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear madam only his letter and the card from milly this morning see she wrote a letter to

sighing i am dying still if he wrote it i suppose thered be some truth in it true or no it fills up your whole day and life always something to think about every moment and see it all round you like a

jilted her after out of the ladies letterwriter when i told her to say a few simple words he could twist how he liked not acting with precipat precip itancy with equal candour the greatest earthly happiness answer to a gentlemans proposal affirmatively my goodness theres nothing else its all very fine for them but as for being a woman as soon as youre old they might as well throw you out in the bottom of the ashpit mulveys was the first when i was in bed that morning and mrs rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when i asked her to hand me and i pointing at them i couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a loo her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the union jack flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken english sailors took all the rock from them and because i didnt run into mass often enough in santa maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on easter sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his majestad an admirer he signed it i near jumped out of my skin i wanted to pick him up when i saw him following me along the calle real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but i never thought hed write making an appointment i had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing i remember shall i wear a white rose and i wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young i put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did i tell him i was engaged for for fun to the son of a spanish nobleman named don miguel de la flora and he believed me that i was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things i told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the spanish girls he didnt like i suppose one of them wouldnt have him i got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till i taught him cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left may yes it was may when the infant king of spain was born im always like that in the spring id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near oharas tower i told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old barbary apes they sent to clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back mrs rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me i had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as i could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump i said i was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place i suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and saint michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there i was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had i could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but i wouldnt lee him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after i tried with the banana but i was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes o yes i pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but i opened my legs i wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because i had a skirt opening up the side i tormented the life out of him first tickling him i loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same i liked him like that moaning i made him blush a little when i got over him that way when i unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them molly darling he called me what was his name jack joe harry mulvey was it yes i think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so i went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back lord its just like yesterday to me and if i was married hed do it to me and i promised him yes faithfully id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20 years if i said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who i might recognise him hes young still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what i did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the chronicle i was a bit wild after when i blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from benady bros and exploded it lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the hebrew on them i wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as i settled it straight h m s calypso swinging my hat that old bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers god send him sense and me more money i suppose theyre called after him i never thought that would be my name bloom when i used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige m bloom youre looking blooming josie used to say after i married him well its better than breen or briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them mrs ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom mulvey i wouldnt go mad about either or suppose i divorced him mrs boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the lord knows after the lovely one she had lunita laredo the fun we had running along williss road to europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs i loved looking down at them i was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to india he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere i went up windmill hill to the flats that sunday morning with captain rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board i wore that frock from the b marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining i could see over to morocco almost the bay of tangier white and the atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear harry molly darling i was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks i kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that gibraltar only that cheap peau despagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else i wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy claddagh ring for luck that i gave gardner going to south africa where those boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with

winter its more company o lord it was rotten cold too that winter when i was only about ten was i yes i had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift i had up to heat myself i loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and i in my skin hopping around i used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance i put out the light too so then there were 2 of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow i hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and findon haddy and hot buttered toast i suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and i love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake i wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but i hate their claws i wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as i wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh place i bought i think ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it friday yes i will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those 2 lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the london and newcastle williams and woods goes twice as far only for the bones i hate those eels cod yes ill get a nice piece of cod im always getting enough for 3 forgetting anyway im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave 5 each and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who mrs fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow i hate those ruck of mary ann coalboxes out for the day whit monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap i dont know who he is with that other beauty burke out of the city arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats 1 consolation i wonder what kind is that book he brought me sweets of sin by a gentleman of fashion some other mr de kock i suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another i couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat i had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old luigi near a hundred they said came from genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings i dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at i suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides i dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night i suppose ill have to put up with it i never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but i saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns o how nice i said whatever i liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in lloyds weekly news 20 years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from i couldnt rest easy till i bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed id cut them off him so i would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night i was sure i heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the lord knows still its the feeling especially now with milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all is at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and boylan thats why he did it im certain the way he plots and plans everything out i couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless i bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when i put the chair against the door just as i was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that i got that little italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands i noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say i pretend things can he im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him i suppose he thinks im finished out and laid on the shelf well im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with tom devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of murray girls calling for her can milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in nelson street riding harry devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose i smelt it off her dress when i was biting off the thread of the button i sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me i tell you only i oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and i had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when i was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the only way in the theatre royal take your foot away out of that i hate people touching me afraid of her life id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the gaiety for beerbohm tree in trilby the last time ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft i think i saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside switzers window at the same little game i recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the broadstone going away well i hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way i did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet i never came properly till i was what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that conny connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had martin harvey for breakfast dinner and supper i thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing i suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man i suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags i have wanting to put her hair up at i s my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way i was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when i asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met mrs joe gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till i gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting i was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or i didnt sleep the night before cheese i ate was it and i told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith i will that was the last time she turned on the teartap i was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am i ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old mrs fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job i found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser i knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially simon dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us i wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head i ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat i told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her ill have to hunt around again for someone every day i get up theres some new thing on sweet god sweet god well when im stretched out dead in my grave i suppose 111 have some peace i want to get up a minute if im let wait o jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am i to do friday saturday sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do god knows theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that michael gunn gave him to see mrs kendal and her husband at the gaiety something he did about insurance for him in drimmies i was fit to be tied though i wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about spinoza and his soul thats dead i suppose millions of years ago i smiled the best i could all in a swamp leaning forward as if i was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag i wont forget that wife of scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted i suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it i wish he had what i had then hed boo i bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what o patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is i dont want to ruin the clean sheets i just put on i suppose the clean linen i wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply o jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens i suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till i suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom i wonder is it nicer in the day i think it is easy i think ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me i might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode i wonder was i too heavy sitting on his knee i made him sit on the easychair purposely when i took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me i hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy god i remember one time i could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy o lord how noisy i hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow 111 have to perfume it in the morning dont forget i bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy god i wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman o lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy o how the waters come down at lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have i something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last i whit monday yes its only about 3 weeks i ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before i married him when i had that white thing coming from me and floey made me go to that dry old stick dr collins for womens diseases on pembroke road your vagina he called it i suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right i wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what i did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if i smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments i suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what i thought he was talking about the rock of gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only i like letting myself down after in the hole as far as i can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it i suppose i always used to know by millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had i frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways i wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or god knows what else still i liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap o anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my precious one everything connected with your glorious body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and i said i hadnt are you sure o yes i said i am quite sure in a way that shut him up i knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me i dont know how the first night ever we met when i was living in rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about lo minutes as if we met somewhere i suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the doyles said he was going to stand for a member of parliament o wasnt i the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the huguenots to sing in french to be more classy o beau pays de la touraine that i never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the albion milk and sulphur soap i used to use and the gelatine still round it o i laughed myself sick at him that day i better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it i suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that indian god he took me to show one wet sunday in the museum in kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and our lords both put together all over asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody i suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes i know i hope the old press doesnt creak ah i knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her o this nuisance of a thing i hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up god help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old cohen i suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from lord napier that i used to admire when i was a little girl because i told him easy piano o i like my bed god here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses were we in at all raymond terrace and ontario terrace and lombard street and holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the city arms hotel worse and worse says warden daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it thoms and helys and mr cuffes and drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the freeman too like the rest on account of those sinner fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers i saw on him wait theres georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour l wait 2 oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first ill look at his shirt to see or ill see if he has that french letter still in his pocketbook i suppose he thinks i dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the aristocrats masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs i suppose im nothing any more when i wouldnt let him lick me in holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so i thought i stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or i dont know what he forgets that wethen i dont ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles i wonder was it her josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and boylan though as for her denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when i was with him with milly at the college races that hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down i tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of mr paddy dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black l boom and tom kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens w c drunk in some place or other and martin cunningham and the two dedaluses and fanny mcoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day i see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially jack power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if i can help it making fun of him then behind his back i know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor paddy dignam all the same im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting bill bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the glencree dinner and ben dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5 in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and simon dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when i sang maritana with him at freddy mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart sweetheart he always sang it not like bartell darcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath o maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to may goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now i wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of italian and im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me i ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still i look young in it i wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not i saw him driving down to the kingsbridge station with his father and mother i was in mourning thats 11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me i heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat i suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when i saw him at mat dillons he liked me too i remember they all do wait by god yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when i laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before i thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt i dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it i hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at i always liked poetry when i was a girl first i thought he was a poet like lord byron and not an ounce of it in his composition i thought he was quite different i wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 i was married 88 milly is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at dillons 5 or 6 about 88 i suppose hes 20 or more im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 i hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of trinity college hes very young to be a professor i hope hes not a professor like goodwin was he was a potent professor of john jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well i suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from tarifa the lighthouse at europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will i ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and billy prescotts ad and keyess ad and tom the devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer im sure hes very distinguished id like to meet a man like that god not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men i could see down in margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a god or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought i could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you i often felt i wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple i wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face i would too in 12 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men i suppose never dream of washing it from i years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches im sure itll be grand if i can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till i see if the wishcard comes out or ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out ill read and study all i can find or learn a bit off by heart if i knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and i can teach him the other part ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous o but then what am i going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because i didnt call him hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of julius caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion god im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old lion would o well i suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always i wished i was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle john has a thing long i heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of marrowbone lane my aunt mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once i start i tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in fair tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for id like to know i cant help it if im young still can i its a wonder im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing i suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent i atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough i kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the lord god i was thinking would i go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose i was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could i only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that k c lives up somewhere this way coming out of hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it i knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when i turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only i suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease o move over your big carcass out of that for the love of mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great suggester don poldo de la flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for lord knows what he does that i dont know and im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will i indeed did you ever see me running id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt i dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what i never had thats why i suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house i suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and i none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when i was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether i suppose i oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket i knitted crying as i was but give it to some poor child but i knew well id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same since o im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more i wonder why he wouldnt stay the night i felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting god knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent i used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you i hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches i suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room i suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm dedalus i wonder its like those names in gibraltar delapaz delagracia they had the devils queer names there father vilaplana of santa maria that gave me the rosary rosales y oreilly in the calle las siete revueltas and pisimbo and mrs opisso in governor street o what a name id go and drown myself in the first river if i had a name like her o my and all the bits of streets paradise ramp and bedlam ramp and rodgers ramp and crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if i am a harumscarum i know i am a bit i declare to god i dont feel a day older than then i wonder could i get my tongue round any of the spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see i havent forgotten it all i thought i had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity i never tried to read that novel cantankerous mrs rubio lent me by valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways i always knew wed go away in the end i can tell him the spanish and he tell me the italian then hell see im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly i could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as i didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like i never could bear the look of them in abrines i could do the criada the room looks all right since i changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time id have to introduce myself not knowing me from adam very funny wouldnt it im his wife or pretend we were in spain with him half awake without a gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for i he can make it for 2 im sure im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that i badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in walpoles only 86 or 186 ill just give him one more chance ill get up early in the morning im sick of cohens old bed in any case i might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning mamy dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when i used to be in the longing way then ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger i suppose hed like my nice cream too i know what ill do ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta masetto then ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is i s l o fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet i wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless i made him stand there and put him into me ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if i am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said o much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears god knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it i suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or he wouldnt have made us the way he did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then ill tell him i want li or perhaps 30 ill tell him i want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad i dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do i could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers o i suppose that cant be helped ill do the indifferent l or 2 questions ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back i know every turn in him ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then ill suggest about yes o wait now sonny my turn is coming ill be quite gay and friendly over it o but i was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then ill go out ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour i suppose theyre just getting up in china now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if i can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only i only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as i can get up early ill go to lambes there beside findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today i mean no no fridays an unlucky day first i want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it i think while im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes i can accompany him first i must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll i wear shall i wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in liptons i love the smell of a rich big shop at 7 12d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar i id a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table id get that cheaper in wait wheres this i saw them not long ago i love flowers id love to have the whole place swimming in roses god of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no god i wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something i often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes i know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do i so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day i got him to propose to me yes first i gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my god after that long kiss i near lost my breath yes he said i was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why i liked him because i saw he understood or felt what a woman is and i knew i could always get round him and i gave him all the pleasure i could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and i wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky i was thinking of so many things he didnt know of mulvey and mr stanhope and hester and father and old captain groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and i say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the greeks and the jews and the arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of europe and duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside larby sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and o that awful deepdown torrent o and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and gibraltar as a girl where i was a flower of the mountain yes when i put the rose in my hair like the andalusian girls used or shall i wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the moorish wall and i thought well as well him as another and then i asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would i yes to say yes my mountain flower and first i put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes i said yes i will yes
