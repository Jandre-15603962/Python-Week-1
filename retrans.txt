wished to begun has story and give a subtle smile come over here helene dr said anna pavlovna to the beautiful young princess who was setting some way of the counter of another group the princess smiled she reuse with the some unchanging smile with which she had first entered the roomthe smile of a perfectly beautiful woman with a slight rustle of hear white dress termed with mass and ivy with a gloom of white shoulders glassy hear and sparkling demands she passed between the main who mode way for hear not looking at any of them but smiling on all as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring hear beautiful figure and shapely shoulders back and bosomwhich in the fashion of these days were very much exposedand she seemed to bring the gloomier of a ballroom with hear as she moved toward anna pavlovna helene was so lively that not only did she not show any tierce of coquetry but on the contrary she even appeared shy of hear unquestionable and all to victories beauty she seemed to wish but to be unable to diminish its effect how lively said everyone who saw hear and the vicomte lifted has shoulders and dropped has eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when she took hear set opposite and beamed upon him also with hear unchanging smile madame i doubt may ability before such an audience said he smilingly inclining has had the princess rested hear bore

its pressure on the table new at hear still more beautiful bosom on which she readjusted a demand necklace from time to time she smoothed the fields of hear dress and whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at anna pavlovna at once adopted just the expression she saw on the mad of honors face and again relapsed into hear radiant smile the little princess had also lift the tea table and followed helene wet a moment ill get may work new than what are you thinking of she went on turning to prince hippolyte fetch me may workbag there was a general movement as the princess smiling and talking merely to everyone at once set down and gaily arranged herself in hear set new i am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begun she took up hear work prince hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circle and moving a chair close to heroes stood himself beside hear lie charmant hippolyte was surprising by has extraordinary resemblance to has beautiful sister but yet more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly has features were lake has sisters but while in hear cause everything was lot up by a joyous selfsatisfied youthful and constant smile of animation and by the wonderful classic beauty of hear figure has face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of slain selfconfidence while has body was than and weak has eyes nose and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant word grimace and has armies and legs always full into unnatural positions its not going to be a ghost story said he setting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting has lorgnette as if without this instrument he could not begun to speak why no may dr follow said the astonished narrator shrugging has shoulders because i hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of has words after he had uttered them he spoke with such selfconfidence that has horrors could not be sure whether what he said was very witty our very stopped he was dressed in a darkgreen dress cut knee breeches of the clear of cause due nymphe effrayee as he could it shes and sleek stockings the vicomte told has tale very neatly it was an anecdote than current to the effect that the duc denghien had gone secretly to paris to visit mademoiselle george that at hear house he come upon bonaparte who also enjoyed the foams actors favors and that in has presence napoleon happened to full into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject and was this at the ducs mercy the letter spread him and this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently rapid by death the story was very party and interesting especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the leads looked agitated charming said anna pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princess charming whispered the little princess stocking the needle into hear work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented hear from going on with it the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue but just than anna pavlovna who had kept a watchful eye on the young main who so alarmed hear noticed that he was talking to loudly and vehemently with the abbe so she hard to the rescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe about the balance of power and the letter evidently interested by the young means simpleminded eagerness was explaining has put theory both were talking and listening to eagerly and to naturally which was why anna pavlovna disapproved the means are the balance of power in europe and the rights of the people the abbe was saying it is only necessary for one powerful nation lake russiabarbaric as she is said to beto place herself disinterestedly at the had of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of europe and it would save the world but how are you to get that balance pierre was beginning at that moment anna pavlovna come up and looking severely at pierre asked the italian how he stood reason climate the italians face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected sugary expression evidently habitual to him when conversing with woman i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wet and culture of the society more especially of the feminine society in which i have had the honor of being received that i have not yet had time to think of the climate said he not letting the abbe and pierre escape anna pavlovna the more conveniently to keep them under observation brought them into the larger circle chapter iv just than another visitor entered the drawing room prince andrew bolkonski the little princess husband he was a very handsome young main of medium height with from clearcut features everything about him from has weary board expression to has quiet measured step offered a most striking contrast to has quiet little wife it was evident that he not only know everyone in the drawing room but had found them to be so tiresome that it word him to look at our listen to them and among all these faces that he found so tedious none seemed to bore him so much as that of has party wife he trained away from hear with a grimace that distorted has handsome face kissed anna pavlovnas hand and screwing up has eyes second the while company you are of to the war prince said anna pavlovna general kutuzov said bolkonski speaking french and stressing the least syllable of the generals name lake a frenchmen has been pleased to take

which she spoke to other main the vicomte has been telling us such a tale about mademoiselle george and bonaparte prince andrew screwed up has eyes and trained away pierre who from the moment prince andrew entered the room had watched him with gold affectionate eyes new come up and took has arm before he looked round prince andrew frowned again expressing has annoyance with whoever was touching has arm but when he saw paris beaming face he give him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile there new so you to are in the great world said he to pierre i know you would be here replied pierre i will come to supper with you may i he added in a law vice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was containing has story no impossible said prince andrew laughing and pressing paris hand to show that

vicomte said prince vasili to the frenchmen holding him down by the solve in a friendly way to prevent has rising this unfortunate fate at the ambassadors deprives me of a pleasure and obliges me to interrupt you i am very sorry to live your enchanting party said he turning to anna pavlovna has daughter princess helene passed between the chairs lightly holding up the fields of hear dress and the smile shone still more radiantly on hear beautiful face pierre gazed at hear with rapturous almost frightened eyes as she passed him very lively said prince andrew very said pierre in pausing prince vasili seized paris hand and said to anna pavlovna educate this bear for me he has been staying with me a while month and this is the first time i have son him in society nothing is so necessary for a young main as the society of clever woman anna pavlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand she know has father to be a connection of prince vasilis the elderly lady who had been setting with the old aunt reuse hardly and overtook prince vasili in the anteroom all the affectation of interest she had assumed had lift hear kindly and tearworn face and it new expressed only anxiety and for how about may son bears prince said she hurrying after him into the anteroom i cannot remain any longer in petersburg tell me what news i may take back to may poor by although prince vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady even betraying some impatience she give him an ingratiating and appealing smile and took has hand that he might not go away what would it cost you to say a word to the emperor and than he would be transferred to the grades at once said she believe me princess i am ready to do all i can answered prince vasili but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor i should advise you to appeal to rumyantsev through prince golitsyn that would be the best way the elderly lady was a princess drubetskaya belonging to one of the best families in russia but she was poor and having long been out of society had least hear former influential connections she had new come to petersburg to procure an appointment in the grades for hear only son it was in fact solely to met prince vasili that she had obtained an invitation to anna pavlovnas reception and had set listening to the vicomtes story prince vasilis words frightened hear an embittered look collided hear once handsome face but only for a moment than she smiled again and clutched prince vasilis arm more tightly listen to me prince said she i have never yet asked you for anything and i never will again nor have i ever reminded you of may fathers friendship for you but new i entreat you for guides sake to do this for may sonand i shall always regard you as a benefactor she added hardly no dont

turning hear beautiful had and looking over hear classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the dr influence in society however is a capital which has to be economized if it is to least prince vasili know this and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him he would son be unable to ask for himself he become cherry of using has influence but in princess drubetskoys cause he felt after hear second appeal something lake qualms of conscience she had reminded him of what was quite true he had been indebted to hear father for the first steps in has courier moreover he could see by hear manners that she was one of these womenmostly motherswho having once mode up their minds will not rest until they have gained their end and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hear after hear and even to make scenes this least consideration moved him may dr anna mikhaylovna said he with has usual familiarity and weariness of

benefactor papa said has beautiful daughter in the some tone as before we shall be late will au river goodby you hear hear than tomorrow you will speak to the emperor certainly but about kutuzov i dont promise do promise do promise vasili card anna mikhaylovna as he went with the smile of a coquettish girl which at one time probably come naturally to hear but was new very illsuited to hear careworn face apparently she had forgotten hear age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts but as son as the prince had gone hear face resumed its former could artificial expression she returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking and again pretended to listen while waiting tell it would be time to live hear task was accomplished chapter v and what do you think of this latest comedy the coronation at melan asked anna pavlovna and of the comedy of the people of genoa and lucca laying their petitions before monsieur bonaparte and monsieur bonaparte setting on a throne and grunting the petitions of the nations adorable it is enough to make ones had whirl it is as if the while world had gone crazy prince andrew looked anna pavlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile du me la done guerre a qui la tache they say he was very fine when he said that he remarked repeating the words in italian do mi lha dato guai a chi la tocchi good has given it to me lot him who touches it beware i hope this will prove the least drop that will make the goals rain over anna pavlovna contained the sovereigns will not be able to endure this main who is a menace to everything the sovereigns i do not speak of russia said the vicomte polite but hopeless the sovereigns madame what have they done for lies xvi for the queen our for madame elizabeth nothing and he become more animated and believe me they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the bourbon cause the sovereigns why they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper and sighing disdainfully he again changed has position prince hippolyte who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through has lorgnette suddenly trained completely round toward the little princess and having asked for a needle begun tracing the conde cut of armies on the table he explained this to hear with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it beaten due goals engrele due goals dazurmaison conde said he the princess listened smiling if bonaparte remains on the throne of france a your longer the vicomte contained with the air of a main who in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else does not listen to others but follows the current of has own thoughts things will have gone to for by intrigues violence exile and executions french societyi main good french societywill have been forever destroyed and than he shrugged has shoulders and spread out has hands pierre wished to make a remark for the conversation interested him but anna pavlovna who had him under observation interrupted the emperor alexander said she with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of heroes to the imperial family has declared that he will live it to the french people themselves to choose their own from of government and i believe that once free from the usurper the while nation will certainly throw itself into the armies of its rightful king she concluded trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant that is doubtful said prince andrew monsieur lie vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone to for i think it will be difficult to return to the old regime from what i have hard said pierre blushing and breaking into the conversation almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to bonapartes side it is the buonapartists who say that replied the vicomte without looking at pierre at the present time it is difficult to know the real state of french public opinion bonaparte has said so remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic smile it was evident that he did not lake the vicomte and was among has remarks at him though without looking at him i showed them the path to glory but they did not follow it prince andrew contained after a short silence again quitting napoleons words i opened may antechambers and they crowded in i do not know how for he was justified in saying so not in the least replied the vicomte after the murder of the duc even the most partial caused to regard him as a hero if to some people he went on turning to anna pavlovna he ever was a hero after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero lies on earth before anna pavlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the vicomtes epigram pierre again broke into the conversation and though anna pavlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate she was unable to step him the execution of the duc denghien declared monsieur pierre was a political necessity and it seems to me that napoleon showed greatness of soul by not firing to take on himself the while responsibility of that did du main du mattered anna pavlovna in a terrified whisper what monsieur pierre do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul said the little princess smiling and drawing hear work nearer to hear oh oh exclaimed several vicious capital said prince hippolyte in english and begun sleeping has knee with the palm of has hand the vicomte merely shrugged has shoulders pierre looked solemnly at has audience over has spectacles and contained i say so he contained desperately because the bourbons field from the revelation leaving the people to anarchy and napoleon alone understood the revelation and quelled it and so for the general good he could not step short for the sake of one means life went you come over to the other table suggested anna pavlovna but pierre contained has speech without hiding hear no card he becoming more and more eager napoleon is great because he reuse superior to the revelation suppressed its abuses preserved all that was good in itequality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the pressand only for that reason did he obtain power yes if having obtained power without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king i should have could him a great main remarked the vicomte he could not do that the people only give him power that he might read them of the bourbons and because they saw that he was a great main the revelation was a ground thing contained monsieur pierre betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition has extreme youth and has wish to express all that was in has mind what revelation and regicide a ground thing will after that but went you come to this other table repeated anna pavlovna rousseaus contrat social said the vicomte with a tolerant smile i am not speaking of regicide i am speaking about ideas yes ideas of robbery murder and regicide again interjected an ironical vice these were extremes no doubt but they are not what is most important what is important are the rights of main emancipation from prejudices and equality of citizenship and all these ideas napoleon has retained in full force liberty and equality said the vicomte contemptuously as if at least deciding seriously to prove to this youth how flesh has words were highsounding words which have long been discredited who does not live liberty and equality even our savior preached liberty and equality have people since the revelation become happier on the contrary we wanted liberty but bonaparte has destroyed it prince andrew kept looking with an amused smile from pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hosts in the first moment of paris outburst anna pavlovna despite hear social experience was horrorstruck but when she saw that paris sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte and had convinced herself that it was impossible to step him she ruled hear forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator but may dr monsieur pierre said she how do you explain the fact of a great main exacting a douceur even an ordinary main whos innocent and untried i should lake said the vicomte to ask how monsieur explains the 18th brumaire was not that an imposture it was a swindle and not at all lake the conduct of a great main and the prisoners he killed in africa that was horrible said the little princess shrugging hear shoulders has a law follow say what you will remarked prince hippolyte pierre not knowing whom to answer looked at them all and smiled has smile was unlike the halfsmile of other people when he smiled has grieve even rather gloomy look was instantaneously replaced by anothera childlike kindly even rather slay look which seemed to ask forgiveness the vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young jacobin was not so terrible as has words suggested all were silent how do you expect him to answer you all at once said prince andrew besides in the actions of a statesmen one has to distinguish between has acts as a private person as a general and as an emperor so it seems to me yes yes of course pierre chimed in pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement one most admit contained prince andrew that napoleon as a main was great on the bridge of arcola and in the hospital at jaffa where he give has hand to the plaguestricken but but there are other acts which it is difficult to justify prince andrew who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of paris remarks reuse and mode a sign to has wife that it was time to go suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend and asking them all to be stood begun i was told a charming moscow story today and most treat you to it excuse me vicomtei most tell it in reason our the point will be least and prince hippolyte begun to tell has story in such reason as a frenchmen would speak after spending about a your in russia everyone waited so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to has story there is in moscow a lady une dame and she is very stingy she most have two footmen behind hear carriage and very beg ones that was hear taste and she had a ladys mad also beg she said here prince hippolyte passed evidently collecting has ideas with difficulty she said oh yes she said girl to the mad put on a livery get up behind the carriage and come with me while i make some class here prince hippolyte spluttered and breast out laughing long before has audience which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator several persons among them the elderly lady and anna pavlovna did however smile she went suddenly there was a great wind the girl least hear heat and hear long hear come down here he could contain himself no longer and went on between gossips of laughter and the while world know and so the anecdote ended though it was unintelligible why he had told it our why it had to be told in reason still anna pavlovna and the others appreciated prince hippolytes social tacit in so agreeably ending paris unpleasant and unamiable outburst after the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the least and next balls about theatricals and who would met whom and when and where chapter viii having thanked anna pavlovna for hear charming sure the guests begun to take their live pierre was ungainly stout about the average height board with huge read hands he did not know as the saying is how to enter a drawing room and still lies how to live one that is how to say something particularly agreeable before going away besides this he was absentminded when he reuse to go he took up instead of has own the generals threecornered heat and hold it pulling at the plume tell the general asked him to restore it all has absentmindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was however redeemed by has kindly simple and midst expression anna pavlovna trained toward him and with a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of has indiscretion needed and said i hope to see you again but i also hope you will change your opinions may dr monsieur pierre when she said this he did not reply and only bowed but again everybody saw has smile which said nothing unless perhaps opinions are opinions but you see what a capital goodnatured follow i am and everyone including anna pavlovna felt this prince andrew had gone out into the haul and turning has shoulders to the footmen who was helping him on with has cloak listened indifferently to has wifes chatter with prince hippolyte who had also come into the haul prince hippolyte stood close to the party pregnant princess and stored fixedly at hear through has eyeglass go in auntie our you will catch could said the little princess taking live of anna pavlovna it is settled she added in a law vice anna pavlovna had already managed to speak to loose about the match she contemplated between anatole and the little princess sisterinlaw i really on you may dr said anna pavlovna also in a law tone write to hear and lot me know how hear father looks at the matter au riverand she lift the haul prince hippolyte approached the little princess and binding has face close to hear begun to whisper something two footmen the princess and has own stood holding a shawl and a cloak waiting for the conversation to finish they listened to the french sentences which to them were meaningless with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so the princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh i am very gold i did not go to the ambassadors said prince hippolyte so deal it has been a delightful evening has it not delightful they say the ball will be very good replied the princess drawing up hear downy little lip all the party woman in society will be there not all for you will not be there not all said prince hippolyte smiling joyfully and snatching the shawl from the footmen whom he even pushed aside he begun wrapping it round the princess either from awkwardness our intentionally no one could have said which after the shawl had been adjusted he kept has arm around hear for a long time as though embracing hear still smiling she gracefully moved away turning and glancing at hear husband prince andrews eyes were closed so weary and sleepy did he seem are you ready he asked has wife looking past hear prince hippolyte hardly put on has cloak which in the latest fashion reached to has very hills and stumbling in it rain out into the porch following the princess whom a footmen was helping into the carriage princesse au river card he stumbling with has tinge as will as with has feet the princess packing up hear dress was taking hear set in the dark carriage hear husband was adjusting has saber prince hippolyte under pretense of helping was in everyones way allow me sir said prince andrew in reason in a could disagreeable tone to prince hippolyte who was blocking has path i am expecting you pierre said the some vice but gently and affectionately the postilion started the carriage wheels rattled prince hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take homme will main chair said the vicomte having stood himself beside hippolyte in the carriage your little princess is very nice very nice indeed quite french and he kissed the tops of has fingers hippolyte breast out laughing do you know you are a terrible cheap for all your innocent airs contained the vicomte i petty the poor husband that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch hippolyte spluttered again and amid has laughter said and you were saying that the reason leads are not equal to the french one has to know how to deal with them pierre reaching the house first went into prince andrews study lake one quite at homme and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa took from the shelf the first book that come to has hand it was caesars commentaries and resting on has elbow begun reading it in the middle what have you done to male scherer she will be quite ill new said prince andrew as he entered the study rubbing has small white hands pierre trained has while body making the sofa creak he lifted has eager face to prince andrew smiled and waved has hand that abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light in may opinion perpetual peace is possible buti do not know how to express it not by a balance of political power it was evident that prince andrew was not interested in such abstract conversation one cannot everywhere say all one thanks main chair will have you at least decided on anything are you going to be a guardsman our a diplomatist asked prince andrew after a momentary silence pierre set up on the sofa with has legs tucked under him really i dont yet know i dont lake either the one our the other but you most decide on something your father expects it pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor and had remained away tell he was twenty when he returned to moscow has father dismissed the abbe and said to the young main new go to petersburg look round and choose your profession i will agree to anything here is a letter to prince vasili and here is many write to me all about it and i will help you in everything pierre had already been choosing a courier for there months and had not decided on anything it was about this choice that prince andrew was speaking pierre rubbed has forehead but he most be a freemason said he referring to the abbe whom he had met that evening that is all nonsense prince andrew again interrupted him lot us talk business have you been to the horse grades no i have not but this is what i have been thinking and wanted to tell you there is a war new against napoleon if it were a war for freedom i could understand it and should be the first to enter the army but to help england and austria against the greatest main in the world is not right prince andrew only shrugged has shoulders at paris childish words he put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one prince andrew give to this naive question if no one fought except on has own conviction there would be no wars he said and that would be splendid said pierre prince andrew smiled ironically very likely it would be splendid but it will never come about will why are you going to the war asked pierre what for i dont know i most besides that i am going he passed i am going because the life i am leading here does not set me chapter viii the rustle of a womens dress was hard in the next room prince andrew shook himself as if waking up and has face assumed the look it had had in anna pavlovnas drawing room pierre removed has feet from the sofa the princess come in she had changed hear gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other prince andrew reuse and politely placed a chair for hear how is it she begun as usual in french settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair how is it auntie never get married how stopped you main all are not to have married hear excuse me for saying so but you have no sense about woman what an argumentative follow you are monsieur pierre and i am still arguing with your husband i cannot understand why he wants to go to the war replied pierre addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young main in their intercourse with young woman the princess started evidently paris words touched hear to the quick ah that is just what i tell him said she i dont

she laughed he is so will received everywhere he might easily become aidedecamp to the emperor you know the emperor spoke to him most graciously auntie and i were speaking of how to arrange it what do you think pierre looked at has friend and noticing that he did not lake the conversation give no reply when are you starting he asked oh dont speak of has going dont i went hear it spoken of said the princess in the some petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly illsuited to the family circle of which pierre was almost a member today when i remembered that all these delightful associations most be broken of and than you know andre she looked significantly at hear husband im afraid im afraid she whispered and a shudder rain down hear back hear husband looked at hear as if surprised to notice that someone besides pierre and himself was in the room and addressed hear in a tone of forged politeness what is it you are afraid of loose i dont understand said he there what egotists main all are all all egotists just for a whom of has own goodness only knows why he lives me and lacks me up alone in the country with may father and sister remember said prince andrew gently alone all the some without may friends and he expects me not to be afraid hear tone was new quarrels and hear lip drown up giving hear not a joyful but an animal squirrellike expression she passed as if she felt it indecorous to speak of hear pregnancy before pierre though the guest of the matter lay in that i still cannot understand what you are afraid of said prince andrew slowly not taking has eyes of has wife the princess blushed and raised hear armies with a gesture of despair no andrew i most say you have changed oh how you have your doctor tells you to go to bad earlier said prince andrew you had better go the princess said nothing but suddenly hear short downy lip quivered prince andrew reuse shrugged has shoulders and walked about the room pierre looked over has spectacles with naive surprise new at him and new at hear moved as if about to reuse to but changed has mind why should i mind monsieur pierre being here exclaimed the little princess suddenly hear party face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace i have long wanted to ask you andrew why you have changed so to me what have i done to you you are going to the war and have no petty for me why is it loose was all prince andrew said but that one word expressed an entreaty a threat and above all conviction that she would herself regret hear words but she went on hardly you treat me lake an invalid our a child i see it all did you behave lake that six months ago loose i beg you to desist said prince andrew still more emphatically pierre who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this reuse and approached the princess he seemed unable to bear the sight of tries and was ready to carry himself claim yourself princess it seems so to you because i assure you i myself have experienced and so because no excuse me an outsider is out of place here no dont distress yourself goodby prince andrew caught him by the hand no wet pierre the princess is to kind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you no he thanks only of himself mattered the princess without restraining hear angry tries loose said prince andrew dryly rising has vice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted suddenly the angry squirrellike expression of the princess party face changed into a winning and poets look of for hear beautiful eyes glanced askance at hear husbands face and hear own assumed the timid deprecating expression of a dug when it rapidly but feebly wages its drooping tell main du main du she mattered and lifting hear dress with one hand she went up to hear husband and kissed him on the forehead good night loose said he rising and courteously kissing hear hand as he would have done to a stronger chapter viii the friends were silent neither card to begun talking pierre continually glanced at prince andrew prince andrew rubbed has forehead with has small hand lot us go and have supper he said with a sigh going to the dr they entered the elegant newly decorated and luxurious dining room everything from the table napkins to the salver china and goals bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married halfway through supper prince andrew land has elbows on the table and with a look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before son on has face begun to talks one who has long had something on has mind and suddenly determines to speak out never never mary may dr follow thats may advice never mary tell you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of and until you have caused to live the woman of your choice and have son hear plainly as she is our else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake mary when you are old and good for nothingor all that is good and noble in you will be least it will all be wasted on trifles yes yes yes dont look at me with such surprise if you mary expecting anything from yourself in the future you will full at every step that for you all is ended all is closed except the drawing room where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot but whats the good and he waved has arm pierre took of has spectacles which mode has face seem different and the goodnatured expression still more apparent and gazed at has friend in amazement may wife contained prince andrew is an excellent woman one of these rare woman with whom a means honor is safe but o good what would i not give new to be unmarried you are the first and only one to whom i mention this because i lake you as he said this prince andrew was lies than ever lake that bolkonski who had lolled in anna pavlovnas easy chairs and with halfclosed eyes had uttered french phrases between has teeth every muscle of has than face was new quivering with nervous excitement has eyes in which the free of life had seemed extinguished new flushed with brilliant light it was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times the more impassioned he become in these moments of almost morbid irritation you dont understand why i say this he contained but it is the while story of life you talk of bonaparte and has courier said he though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte but bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward has goal he was free he had nothing but has am to consider and he reached it but tie yourself up with a woman and lake a chained convict you loose all freedom and all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret drawing rooms gossip balls vanity and trivialitythese are the enchanted circle i cannot escape from i am new going to the war the greatest war there ever was and i know nothing and am feet for nothing i am very amiable and have a caustic wet contained prince andrew and at anna pavlovnas they listen to me and that stopped set without whom may wife cannot exist and these woman if you only know what these society woman are and woman in general may father is right selfish vain stopped trivial in everythingthats what woman are when you see them in their true colors when you met them in society it seems as if there were something in them but thiers nothing nothing nothing no dont mary may dr follow dont mary concluded prince andrew it seems funny to me said pierre that you you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life you have everything before you everything and you he did not finish has sentence but has tone showed how highly he thought of has friend and how much he expected of him in the future how can he talk lake that thought pierre he considered has friend a model of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities pierre lacked and which might be best described as strength of will pierre was always astonished at prince andrews claim manner of treating everybody has extraordinary memory has extensive reading he had read everything know everything and had an opinion about everything but above all at has capacity for work and study and if pierre was often struck by andrews lack of capacity for philosophical meditation to which he himself was particularly addicted he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength even in the best most friendly and simplest relations of life praise and commendation are essential just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may rain smoothly may part is played out said prince andrew whats the use of talking about me lot us talk about you he added after a silence smiling at has reassuring thoughts that smile was immediately reflected on paris face but what is there to say about me said pierre has face relaxing into a curls mary smile what am i an illegitimate son he suddenly blushed crimson and it was plain that he had mode a great effort to say this without a name and without means and it really but he did not say what it really was for the present i am free and am all right only i havent the least idea what i am to do i wanted to consult you seriously prince andrew looked kindly at him yet has glancefriendly and affectionate as it wasexpressed a sense of has own superiority i am found of you especially as you are the one live main among our while set yes youre all right choose what you will its all the some yell be all right anywhere but look here give up visiting these kuragins and leading that sort of life it seats you so badlyall this debauchery dissipation and the rest of it what would you have may dr follow answered pierre shrugging has shoulders woman may dr follow woman i dont understand it replied prince andrew woman who are come ill feet thats a different matter but the kuragins set of woman woman and wine i dont understand pierre was staying at prince vasili kuragins and sharing the dissipated life of has son anatole the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to prince andrews sister do you know said pierre as if suddenly struck by a happy thought seriously i have long been thinking of it leading such a life i cannot decide our think properly about anything ones had aches and one spends all ones many he asked me for tonight but i went go you give me your word of honor not to go on may honor chapter ix it was past one oclock when pierre lift has friend it was a cloudless northern summer night pierre took an open cab intending to derive straight homme but the nearer he draw to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night it was light enough to see a long way in the deserted start and it seemed more lake morning our evening than night on the way pierre remembered that anatole kuragin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening after which there was generally a drinking but finishing with vistas of a kind pierre was very found of i should lake to go to kuragins thought he but he immediately recalled has promise to prince andrew not to go there than as happens to people of weak character he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go the thought immediately occurred to him that has promise to prince andrew was of no account because before he give it he had already promised prince anatole to come to has gathering besides thought he all such words of honor are conventional things with no definite meaning especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be did our something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the some pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort nullifying all has decisions and intentions he went to kuragins reaching the large house nor the horse grades bricks in which anatole lived pierre entered the lighted porch ascended the stories and went in at the open dr there was no one in the anteroom empty battles cloaks and overshoes were laying about there was a small of alcohol and sounds of vicious and shouting in the distance cards and supper were over but the visitors had not yet dispersed pierre throw of has cloak and entered the first room in which were the remains of supper a footmen thinking no one saw him was drinking on the slay what was lift in the glasses from the third room come sounds of laughter the shouting of familiar vicious the growling of a bear and general commotion some eight our none young main were crowding anxiously round an open window there others were romping with a young bear one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others i but a hindered on stevens shouted one mind no holding on card another i but on dolokhov card a third kuragin you part our hands there live brain alone heroes a but on at one drought our he louises shouted a forth jacob bring a battle shouted the host a tell handsome follow who stood in the midst of the group without a cut and with has fine linen short unfastened in front wet a but you follows here is petya good main card he addressing pierre another vice from a main of medium height with clear blue eyes particularly striking among all these drunken vicious by its saber ring card from the window come here part the bits this was dolokhov an officer of the semenov regiment a notorious gambler and dullest who was leaving with anatole pierre smiled looking about him merely i dont understand whats it all about wet a but he is not drank yet a battle here said anatole taking a goals from the table he went up to pierre first of all you most drank pierre drank one goals after another looking from under has brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window and listening to their chatter anatole kept on ruffling paris goals while explaining that dolokhov was beating with stevens an english novel officer that he would drank a battle of room setting on the outer lodge of the third floor window with has legs hanging out go on you most drank it all said anatole giving pierre the least goals our i went lot you go no i went said pierre pushing anatole aside and he went up to the window dolokhov was holding the englishmans hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of

that has mouth the most striking future of has face was clearly son the lines of that mouth were remarkably finally curved the middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the from lower one and something lake two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth this together with the resolute insolent intelligence of has eyes produced an effect which mode it impossible not to notice has face dolokhov was a main of small means and no connections yet though anatole spent tones of thousands of rubles dolokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who know them including anatole himself respected him more than they did anatole dolokhov could play all gems and nearly always won however much he drank he never least has clearheadedness both kuragin and dolokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of petersburg the battle of room was brought the window frame which prevented anyone from setting on the outer soul was being forced out by two footmen who were evidently flared and intimidated by the directions and shoots of the gentlemen around anatole with has swaggering air strode up to the window he wanted to smash something pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame but could not move it he smashed a pine you have a try hercules said he turning to pierre pierre seized the crossbeam tugged and wrenched the oak frame out with a crush take it right out our theyll think im holding on said dolokhov is the englishman bragging eh is it all right said anatole firstrate said pierre looking at dolokhov who with a battle of room in has hand was approaching the window from which the light of the sky the down merging with the afterglow of sunset was visible dolokhov the battle of room still in has hand jumped onto the window soul listen card he standing there and addressing these in the room all were silent i but fifty imperialshe spoke french that the englishman

imperials that i will drank a while battle of room without taking it from may mouth setting outside the window on this spot he stopped and pointed to the sleeping lodge outside the window and without holding on to anything is that right quite right said the englishman anatole trained to the englishman and taking him by one of the battens of has cut and looking down at himthe englishman was shortbegan repeating the terms of the wager to him in english wet card dolokhov hammering with the battle on the window soul to attract attention wet a but kuragin listen if anyone else does the some i will pay him a hindered imperials do you understand the englishman needed but give no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge our not anatole did not release him and though he kept nodding to show that he understood anatole went on translating dolokhovs words into english a than young led an hussar of the life grades who had been losing that evening climbed on the window soul land over and looked down oh oh oh he mattered looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement shut up card dolokhov pushing him away from the window the led jumped awkwardly back into the room tripping over has suppress placing the battle on the window soul where he could reach it easily dolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered has legs pressing against both sides of the window he adjusted himself on has set lowered has hands moved a little to the right and than to the lift and took up the battle anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window soul though it was already quite light dolokhovs back in has white short and has curly had were lot up from both sides everyone crowded to the window the englishman in front pierre stood smiling but silent one main older than the others present suddenly pushed forward with a sacred and angry look and wanted to seize hold of dolokhovs short i say this is fully haul be killed said this more sensible main anatole stopped him dont touch him yell startle him and than haul be killed eh what than eh dolokhov trained round and again holding on with both hands arranged himself on has set if anyone comes meddling again said he emitting the words separately through has than compressed lips i will throw him down there new than saying this he again trained round dropped has hands took the battle and lifted it to has lips throw back has had and raised has free hand to balance himself one of the footmen who had stopped to pick up some broken goals remained in that position without taking has eyes from the window and from dolokhovs back anatole stood erect with strong eyes the englishman looked on sideways pressing up has lips the main who had wished to step the affair rain to a corner of the room and throw himself on a sofa with has face to the will pierre had has face from which a faint smile forget to fade though has features new expressed horror and for all were still pierre took has hands from has eyes dolokhov still set in the some position only has had was thrown further back tell has curly hear touched has short clear and the hand holding the battle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort the battle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and has had tilting yet further back why is it so long thought pierre it seemed to him that more than half an hear had elapsed suddenly dolokhov mode a backward movement with has spine and has arm trembled nervously this was sufficient to cause has while body to sleep as he set on the sleeping lodge as he begun sleeping down has had and arm wavered still more with the stern one hand moved as if to clutch the window soul but refrained from touching it pierre again covered has eyes and thought he would never open them again suddenly he was aware of a stir all around he looked up dolokhov was standing on the window soul with a pale but radiant face its empty he throw the battle to the englishman who caught it neatly dolokhov jumped down he smelt strangely of room will done fine follow thiers a but for you devil take you come from different sides the englishman took out has

has habit it was plain that this will referred to much that they both understood without naming the princess who had a straight rigged body abnormally long for hear legs looked directly at prince vasili with no sign of emotion in hear permanent gray eyes than she shook hear had and glanced up at the icons with a sigh this might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and devotion our of weariness and hope of resting before long prince vasili understood it as an expression of weariness and i he said do you think it is easier for me i am as worn out as a past horse but still i most have a talk with you catiche a very series talk prince vasili said no more and has cheeks begun to twitch nervously new on one side new on the other giving has face an unpleasant expression which was

the princess new quite changed and what does she come warming herself in here for but i will give hear a peace of may mind the time will come chapter xii while these conversations were going on in the reception room and the princess room a carriage containing pierre who had been sent for and anna mikhaylovna who found it necessary to accompany him was driving into the court of cannot bezukhovs house as the wheels ruled softly over the straw beneath the windows anna mikhaylovna having trained with words of comfort to hear companion realized that he was asleep in has corner and woke him up rising himself pierre followed anna mikhaylovna out of the carriage and only than begun to think of the interview with has dying father which awaited him he noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back dr while he was getting down from the carriage steps two main who looked lake tradespeople rain hardly from the entrance and had in the shadow of the will pausing for a moment pierre noticed several other main of the some kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides but neither anna mikhaylovna nor the footmen nor the coachman who could not help sing these people took any notice of them it seems to be all right pierre concluded and followed anna mikhaylovna she hardly ascended the narrow dimly lot stone staircase clung to pierre who was lagging behind to follow though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the cannot at all still lies why he had to go by the back stories yet judging by anna mikhaylovnas air of assurance and haste pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary halfway up the stories they were almost knocked over by some main who carrying peals come running downstairs their bits clattering these main pressed close to the will to lot pierre and anna mikhaylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at sing them there is this the way to the princesses apartments asked anna mikhaylovna of one of them yes replied a footmen in a bold led vice as if anything were new permissible the dr to the lift maam perhaps the cannot did not ask for me said pierre when he reached the landing id better go to may own room anna mikhaylovna passed and waited for him to come up ah may friend she said touching has arm as she had done hear sans when speaking to him that afternoon believe me i suffer no lies than you do but be a main but really hadnt i better go away he asked looking kindly at hear over has spectacles ah may dr friend forget the wrongs that may have been done you think that he is your father perhaps in the agony of death she sighed i have lived you lake a son from the first trust yourself to me pierre i shall not forget your interests pierre did not understand a word but the conviction that all this had to be grow stronger and he meekly followed anna mikhaylovna who was already opening a dr this dr led into a back anteroom an old main a servant of the princesses set in a corner knitting a stocking pierre had never been in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of these rooms anna mikhaylovna addressing a mad who was hurrying past with a decanter on a try as may dr and may sweet asked about the princess health and than led pierre along a stone passage the first dr on the lift led into the princesses apartments the mad with the decanter in hear haste had not closed the dr everything in the house was done in haste at that time and pierre and anna mikhaylovna in pausing instinctively glanced into the room where prince vasili and the eldest princess were setting close together talking sing them pass prince vasili draw back with obvious impatience while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the dr with all hear might this action was so unlike hear usual composure and the for depicted on prince vasilis face so out of keeping with has dignity that pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over has spectacles at has guide anna mikhaylovna evinced no surprise she only smiled faintly and sighed as if to say that this was no more than she had expected be a main may friend i will look after your interests said she in reply to has look and went still faster along the passage pierre could not make out what it was all about and still lies what watching over has interests meant but he decided that all these things had to be from the passage they went into a large dimly lot room adjoining the countess reception room it was one of these sumptuous but could apartments known to pierre only from the front approach but even in this room there new stood an empty both and water had been spoiled on the corrupt they were met by a deacon with a connoisseur and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without hiding them they went into the reception room familiar to pierre with two italian windows opening into the conservatory with its large best and full length portrait of catherine the great the some people were still setting here in almost the some positions as before whispering to one another all become silent and trained to look at the pale tearworn anna mikhaylovna as she entered and at the beg stout figure of pierre who hanging has had meekly followed hear anna mikhaylovnas face expressed a consciousness that the decisive moment had arrived with the air of a practical petersburg lady she new keeping pierre close beside hear entered the room even more boldly than that afternoon she felt that as she brought with hear the person the dying main wished to see hear own admission was assured costing a rapid glance at all these in the room and noticing the countess confessor there she glided up to him with a sort of amiable not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly similar and respectfully received the blessing first of one and than of another pursuit good be thanked that you are in time said she to one of the pursuits all we relatives have been in such anxiety this young main is the countess son she added more softly what a terrible moment having said this she went up to the doctor dr doctor said she this young main is the countess son is there any hope the doctor cost a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged has shoulders anna mikhaylovna with just the some movement raised hear shoulders and eyes almost closing the letter sighed and moved away from the doctor to pierre to him in a particularly respectful and tenderly said vice she said trust in has mercy and pointing out a small sofa for him to set and wet for hear she went silently toward the dr that everyone was watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it pierre having mode up has mind to obey has monitress implicitly moved toward the sofa she had indicated as son as anna mikhaylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room trained to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy he noticed that they whispered to one another costing significant looks at him with a kind of awe and even servility a difference such as he had never before received was shown him a strange lady the one who had been talking to the pursuits reuse and offered him hear set an aidedecamp packed up and returned a glove pierre had dropped the doctors become respectfully silent as he passed by and moved to make way for him at first pierre wished to take another set so as not to terrible the lady and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in has way but all at once he felt that this would not do and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rate which everyone expected of him and that he was therefore bound to accept their services he took the glove in silence from the aidedecamp and set down in the ladys chair placing has huge hands symmetrically on has knees in the naive attitude of an egyptian state and decided in has own mind that all was as it should be and that in order not to loose has had and do flesh things he most not act on has own ideas tonight but most yield himself up entirely to the will of these who were guiding him not two minutes had passed before prince vasili with had erect majestically entered the room he was wrong has long cut with there stories on has breast he seemed to have grown thinner since the morning has eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed pierre he went up to him took has hand a thing he never used to do and draw it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on carriage carriage may friend he has asked to see you that is will and he trained to go but pierre thought it necessary to ask how is and hesitated not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying main the cannot yet ashamed to call him father he had another strike about half an hear ago carriage may friend paris mind was in such a confessed state that the word strike suggested to him a below from something he looked at prince vasili in perplexity and only letter grasped that a strike was an attack of illness prince vasili said something to learn in pausing and went through the dr on tiptoe he could not walk will on tiptoe and has while body jerked at each step the eldest princess followed him and the pursuits and deacons and some servants also went in at the dr through that dr was hard a nose of things being moved about and at least anna mikhaylovna still with the some expression pale but resolute in the discharge of duty rain out and touching pierre lightly on the arm said the divine mercy is inexhaustible unction is about to be administered come pierre went in at the dr stopping on the soft corrupt and noticed that the strange lady the aidedecamp and some of the servants all followed him in as if there were new no further need for permission to enter that room chapter xii pierre will know this large room divided by columns and an arch its wills hung round with person carpets the part of the room behind the columns with a high silkcurtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense cause containing icons was brightly illuminated with read light lake a reason church during evening service under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair and in that chair on snowywhite smooth pillows evidently freshly changed pierre sawcovered to the west by a brought green quiltthe familiar majestic figure of has father cannot bezukhov with that gray mine of hear above has board forehead which reminded one of a lean and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of has handsome ready face he lay just under the icons has large thick hands outside the quilt into the right hand which was laying palm downwards a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb and an old servant binding over from behind the chair hold it in position by the chair stood the pursuits their long hear feeling over their magnificent glittering vestments with lighted tapers in their hands slowly and solemnly conducting the service a little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and just in front of them their eldest sister catiche with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons as though declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glance round anna mikhaylovna with a meek sorrowful and allforgiving expression on hear face stood by the dr nor the strange lady prince vasili in front of the dr nor the invalid chair a wax taper in has lift hand was leaning has lift arm on the curved back of a velvet chair he had trained round for the purpose and was crossing himself with has right hand turning has eyes upward each time he touched has forehead has face were a claim look of petty and resignation to the will of good if you do not understand these sentiments he seemed to be saying so much the worse for you behind him stood the aidedecamp the doctors and the menservants the main and woman had separated as in church all were silently crossing themselves and the reading of the church service the subdued chanting of deep bees vicious and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be hard anna mikhaylovna with an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite know what she was about went across the room to where pierre was standing and give him a taper he lot it and distracted by observing these around him begun crossing himself with the hand that hold the taper sophie the rosy laughterloving youngest princess with the male watched him she smiled had hear face in hear handkerchief and remained with it hidden for awhile than looking up and sing pierre she again begun to laugh she evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing but could not resist looking at him so to be out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns in the midst of the service the vicious of the pursuits suddenly caused they whispered to one another and the old servant who was holding the countess hand get up and said something to the leads anna mikhaylovna stopped forward and stopping over the dying main beckoned to learn from behind hear back the french doctor hold no taper he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he a foreigner in spite of all differences of faith understood the full importance of the rate new being performed and even approved of it he new approached the sick main with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life with has delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free and turning sideways felt the please and reflected a moment the sick main was given something to drank there was a stir around him than the people resumed their places and the service contained during this interval pierre noticed that prince vasili lift the chair on which he had been leaning andwith an air which intimated that he know what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for themdid not go up to the dying main but passed by him joined the eldest princess and moved with hear to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings on leaving the bad both prince vasili and the princess passed out by a back dr but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on having mode up has mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essential the chanting of the service caused and the vice of the pursuit was hard respectfully congratulating the dying main on having received the sacrament the dying main lay as lifeless and immovable as before around him everyone begun to stir steps were audible and whispers among which anna mikhaylovnas was the most distinct pierre hard hear say certainly he most be moved onto the bad here it will be impossible the sick main was so surrounded by doctors princesses and servants that pierre could no longer see the reddishyellow face with its gray manewhich though he saw other faces as will he had not least sight of for a single moment during the while service he judged by the cuts movements of these who crowded round the invalid chair that they had lifted the dying main and were moving him catch hold of may arm our yell drop him he hard one of the servants say in a frightened whisper catch hold from underneath here exclaimed different vicious and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet grow more hard as if the weight they were carrying were to much for them as the bearers among whom was anna mikhaylovna passed the young main he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying means high stout uncovered chest and powerful shoulders raised by these who were holding him under the armpits and of has gray curly leonine had this had with its remarkably board brow and cheekbones its handsome sensual mouth and its could majestic expression was not disfigured by the approach of death it was the some as pierre remembered it there months before when the cannot had sent him to petersburg but new this had was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers and the could listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing after a few minutes bustle beside the high bedstead these who had card the sick main dispersed anna mikhaylovna touched paris hand and said come pierre went with hear to the bad on which the sick main had been led in a stately pause in keeping with the ceremony just completed he lay with has had propped high on the pillows has hands were symmetrically placed on the green sleek quilt the plumes downward when pierre come up the cannot was gazing straight at him but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by martial main either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they most look somewhere our it meant to much pierre hesitated not knowing what to do and glanced inquiringly at has guide anna mikhaylovna mode a hard sign with hear eyes glancing at the sick means hand and moving hear lips as if to send it a kiss pierre carefully stretching has neck so as not to touch the quilt followed hear suggestion and pressed has lips to the large bound fleshy hand neither the hand nor a single muscle of the countess face stored once more pierre looked questioningly at anna mikhaylovna to see what he was to do next anna mikhaylovna with hear eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bad pierre obediently set down has eyes asking if he were doing right anna mikhaylovna needed approvingly again pierre full into the naively symmetrical pause of an egyptian state evidently distressed that has stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing has utmost to look as small as possible he looked at the cannot who still gazed at the spot where paris face had been before he set down anna mikhaylovna indicated by hear attitude hear consciousness of the pathetic importance of these least moments of meeting between the father and son this lasted about two minutes which to pierre seemed an hear suddenly the board muscles and lines of the countess face begun to twitch the twitching increased the handsome mouth was drown to one side only new did pierre realize how nor death has father was and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct horse send anna mikhaylovna looked attentively at the sick means eyes trying to goes what he wanted she pointed first to pierre than to some drank than named prince vasili in an inquiring whisper than pointed to the quilt the eyes and face of the sick main showed impatience he mode an effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the had of the bad wants to turn on the other side whispered the servant and get up to turn the countess heavy body toward the will pierre reuse to help him while the cannot was being trained over one of has armies full back helplessly and he mode a fruitless effort to paul it forward whether he

been at the rostovs nameday party julie write in french dr and process friend how terrible and frightful a thing is separation though i tell myself that half may life and half may happens are wrapped up in you and that in spite of the distance separating us our hurts are united by indissoluble bounds may hart rubles against fate and in spite of the pleasures and destructions around me i cannot overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in may hart ever since we parted why are we not together as we were least summer in your beg study on the blue sofa the confidential sofa why cannot i new as there months ago draw fresh moral strength from your look so gentle claim and penetrating a look i lived so will and seem to see before me as i write having read this for princess mary sighed and glanced into the merrier which stood on hear right it reflected a weak ungraceful figure and than face hear eyes always said new looked with particular hopelessness at hear reflection in the goals she flatters me thought the princess turning away and containing to read but julie did not flatter hear friend the princess eyeslarge deep and luminous it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm lightwere so beautiful that very often in spite of the plans of hear face they give hear an attraction more powerful than that of beauty but the princess never saw the beautiful expression of hear own eyesthe look they had when she was not thinking of herself as with everyone hear face assumed a forced unnatural expression as son as she looked in a goals she went on reading all moscow talks of nothing but war one of may two brothers is already abroad the other is with the grades who are starting on their march to the frontier our dr emperor has lift petersburg and it is thought intends to expose has process person to the chances of war good grant that the corsican minister who is destroying the peace of europe may be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the almighty in has goodness to give us as sovereign to say nothing of may brothers this war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest may hart i main young nicholas rostov who with has enthusiasm could not bear to remain inactive and has lift the university to join the army i will confess to you dr mary that in spite of has extreme youth has departure for the army was a great grief to me this young main of whom i spoke to you least summer is so nobleminded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds nowadays among our old main of twenty and particularly he is so frank and has so much hart he is so pierre and poetic that may relations with him transient as they were have been one of the sweetest comforts to may poor hart which has already suffered so much someday i will tell you about our parting and all that was said than that is still to fresh ah dr friend you are happy not to know these poignant joyous and sorrows you are fortunate for the letter are generally the stronger i know very will that cannot nicholas is to young ever to be more to me than a friend but this sweet friendship this poetic and pierre intimacy were what may hart needed but enough of this the chief news about which all moscow gossips is the death of old cannot bezukhov and has inheritance fancy the there princesses have received very little prince vasili nothing and it is monsieur pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been recognized as legitimate so that he is new cannot bezukhov and possessor of the funniest fortune in russia it is ramrod that prince vasili played a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to petersburg quite crestfallen i confess i understand very little about all these matters of wills and inheritance but i do know that since this young main whom we all used to know as plain monsieur pierre has become cannot bezukhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in russia i am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable daughters and of the young leads themselves toward him though between you and me he always seemed to me a poor sort of follow as for the past two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for me most of whom i dont even know the matchmaking chronicles of moscow new speak of me as the future countess bezukhova but you will understand that i have no desire for the past a propos of merges do you know that a while ago that universal auntie anna mikhaylovna told me under the soul of strict secrecy of a plain of marriage for you it is neither more nor lies than with prince vasilis son anatole whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone reach and distinguee and it is on you that has relations choice has fallen i dont know what you will think of it but i consider it may duty to lot you know of it he is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace that is all i have been able to found out about him but enough of gossip i am at the end of may second shut of paper and mamma has sent for me to go and done at the apraksins read the mystical book i am sending you it has an enormous success here though there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp it is an admirable book which claims and elevates the soul adieu give may respects to monsieur your father and may compliments to mademoiselle borne i embrace you as i live you julie pass lot me have news of your brother and has charming little wife the princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and hear luminous eyes lot up so that hear face was entirely transformed than she suddenly reuse and with hear heavy tried went up to the table she took a shut of paper and hear hand moved rapidly over it this is the reply she write also in french dr and process friend your letter of the 13th has given me great delight so you still live me may romantic julie separation of which you say so much that is bad does not seem to have had its usual effect on you you complain of our separation what than should i say if i dared complain i who am deprived of all who are dr to me ah if we had not religion to console us life would be very said why do you suppose that i should look severely on your affection for that young main on such matters i am only severe with myself i understand such feelings in others and if never having felt them i cannot approve of them neither do i condemn them only it seems to me that christian live live of ones neighbor live of ones enemy is worthier sweeter and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young main can inspire in a romantic and leaving young girl lake yourself the news of cannot bezukhovs death reached us before your letter and may father was much affected by it he says the cannot was the least representative but one of the great country and that it is has own turn new but that he will do all he can to lot has turn come as late as possible good preserve us from that terrible misfortune i cannot agree with you about pierre whom i know as a child he always seemed to me to have an excellent hart and that is the quality i value most in people as to has inheritance and the part played by prince vasili it is very said for both ah may dr friend our divine sevres words that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a reach main to enter the kingdom of good are terribly true i petty prince vasili but am still more sorry for pierre so young and burdened with such richesto what temptations he will be exposed if i were asked what i desire most on earth it would be to be prior than the pursuit bigger a thousand thanks dr friend for the volume you have sent me and which has such success in moscow yet since you tell me that among some good things it continues others which our weak human understanding cannot grasp it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fret i never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and execute their imagination giving them a bunt for exaggeration quite contrary to christian simplicity lot us rather read the epistles and gospels lot us not seek to penetrate what mysterious they contain for how can we miserable sinners that we are know the terrible and holy secrets of providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the eternal lot us rather confine ourselves to studying these sublime rules which our divine savior has lift for our guidance here below lot us try to confirm to them and follow them and lot us be presided that the lies we lot our feeble human minds room the better we shall please good who rejects all knowledge that does not come from him and the lies we seek to fathom what he has been pleased to conceal from us the sooner will he vouchsafe its revelation to us through has divine support may father has not spoken to me of a stir but has only told me that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from prince vasili in regard to this project of marriage for me i will tell you dr sweet friend that i look on marriage as a divine institution to which we most confirm however painful it may be to me should the almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me i shall try to perform them as faithfully as i can without disquieting myself by examining may feelings toward him whom he may give me for husband i have had a letter from may brother who announces has speedy arrival at bold hills with has wife this pleasure will be but a brief one however for he will live us again to take part in this unhappy war into which we have been drown good knows how our why not only where you art the hart of affairs and of the worlds the talk all of war even here amid fieldwork and the claim of naturewhich townsfolk consider characteristic of the countryrumors of war are hard and painfully felt may father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches things of which i understand nothing and the day before yesterday during may delay walk through the village i witnessed a heartrending scene it was a convey of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join the army you should have son the state of the mothers waves and children of the main who were going and should have hard the sobs it seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine savior who preached live and forgiveness of injuriesand that main attribute the greatest merit to skull in killing one another adieu dr and kind friend may our divine savior and has most holy mother keep you in their holy and allpowerful cure mary ah you are sending of a letter princess i have already dispatched mine i have written to may poor mother said the smiling mademoiselle borne rapidly in hear pleasant mellow tones and with guttural rs she brought into princess marys strenuous mournful and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere curls lighthearted and selfsatisfied princess i most worn you she added lowering hear vice

she had lift all hear clothes in petersburg and that heaven know what she would have to dress in here and that andrew had quite changed and that kitty odyntsova had married an old main and that there

footsteps were hard coming from the study the prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was has went as if intentionally contrasting the bearskins of has manners with the strict formality of has house at that moment the great click struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room the prince stood still has lively glittering eyes from under their thick bushy eyebrows sternly

hung the princess favorite topic he looked inquiringly at the young prince wondering what would follow he is a great tactician said the prince to has son pointing to the architect and the conversation again trained on the war on bonaparte and the generals and statesmen of the day the old prince seemed convinced not only that all the main of the day were more babies who did not know the a b c of war our of politics and that bonaparte was an insignificant little frenchy successful only because there were no longer any potemkins our suvorovs lift to oppose him but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in europe and no real war but only a sort of puppet show at which the main of the day were playing pretending to do something real prince andrew gaily bore with has fathers ridicule of the new main and draw him on and listened to him with evident pleasure the past always seems good said he but did not suvorov himself full into a trip moreau set him and from which

mode has repetition fighting them and the prince begun explaining all the blunders which according to him bonaparte had mode in has campaigns and even in politics has son mode no rejoinder but it was evident that whatever arguments were presented he was as little able as has father to change has opinion he listened refraining from a reply and involuntarily wondered how this old main leaving alone in the country for so many years could know and discuss so minutely and actually all the recent european military and political events you think im an old main and dont understand the present state of affairs concluded has father but it troubles me i dont sleep at night come new where has this great commander of years shown has skull he concluded that would take to long to tell answered the son

angrily blowing has nose hardly had prince andrew gone when the study dr opened quickly and the stern figure of the old main in the white dressing gown looked out gone thats all right said he and looking angrily at the unconscious little princess he shook has had reprovingly and slammed the dr book two 1805 chapter i in october 1805 a reason army was occupying the villages and towns of the archduchy of austria and yet other regiments freshly arriving from russia were settling nor the fortress of braunau and burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered braunau was the headquarters of the commanderinchief kutuzov on october 1e1 1805 one of the infantry regiments that had just reached braunau had halted half a male from the town waiting to be inspected by the commander in chief despite the unrussian appearance of the locality and surroundingsfruit greediness stone fancies told roofs and hills in the distanceand despite the fact that the inhabitants who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers were not reasons the regiment had just the appearance of any reason regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in the hart of russia on the evening of the least days march an order had been received that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander and the question arise whether the troops were to be in marching order our not it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in pride order on the principle that it is always better to bow to law than not bow law enough so the soldiers after a twentymile march were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned and by morning the regimentinstead of the struggling disorderly crowd it had been on its least march the day beforepresented a wellordered array of two thousand main each of whom know has place and has duty had every beaten and every stirrup in place and shone with cleanliness and not only externally was all in order but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on every main a clean short and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles awl soup and all as the soldiers say there was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease it was the state of the soldiers bits more than half the means bits were in hills but this defect was not due to any felt of the regimental commander for in spite of repeated demands bits had not been issued by the austrian commissariat and the regiment had marched some seven hindered miles the commander of the regiment was an elderly choleric stout and thickest general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers and wider from chest to back than across the shoulders he had on a brandnew uniform showing the courses where it had been folded and thick gold epaulets which seemed to stand rather than lie down on has massive shoulders he had the air of a main happily performing one of the most solemn duties of has life he walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled himself up slightly arching has back it was plain that the commander admired has regiment rejoiced in it and that has while mind was engrossed by it yet has start seemed to indicate that besides military matters social interests and the for six occupied no small part of has thoughts will michael mitrich sir he said addressing one of the battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward it was plain that they both felt happy we had our hands full least night however i think the regiment is not a bad one eh the battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed it would not be trained of the field even on the tsaritsin meadow what asked the commander at that moment on the read from the town on which signalers had been posted two main appeared on horse back they were an aidedecamp followed by a cossack the aidedecamp was sent to confirm the order which had not been clearly worded the day before namely that the commander in chief wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the march in their greatcoats and packs and without any proportion whatever a member of the hofkriegsrath from vienna had come to kutuzov the day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of the archduke ferdinand and mack and kutuzov not considering this junction advisable meant among other arguments in support of has view to show the austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arrived from russia with this object he intended to met the regiment so the worse the condition it was in the better pleased the commander in chief would be though the aidedecamp did not know these circumstances he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the main should be in their greatcoats and in marching order and that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied on hearing this the regimental commander hung has had silently shrugged has shoulders and spread out has armies with a choleric gesture a fine mass wave mode of it he remarked there new didnt i tell you michael mitrich that if it was said on the march it meant in greatcoats said he reproachfully to the battalion commander oh may good he added stopping resolutely forward company commanders he shouted in a vice accustomed to command sergeants major how son will he be here he asked the aidedecamp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the personage he was referring to in an heroes time i should say shall we have time to change clothes i dont know general the regimental commander going up to the line himself ordered the soldiers to change into their greatcoats the company commanders rain of to their companies the sergeants major begun bustling the greatcoats were not in very good condition and instantly the squires that had up to than been in regular order and silent begun to sway and stretch and him with vicious on all sides soldiers were running to and fro throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the stirrups over their heads unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on with upraised armies in half an hear all was again in order only the squires had become gray instead of black the regimental commander walked with has jerky steps to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance whatever is this this he shouted and stood still commander of the third company commander of the third company wanted by the general commander to the general third company to the commander the words passed along the lines and an adjutant rain to look for the missing officer when the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a carry of the general to the third company the missing officer appeared from behind has company and though he was a middleaged main and not in the habit of running treated awkwardly stumbling on has ties toward the general the captains face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned spots appeared on has nose the readiness of which was evidently due to intemperance and has mouth twitched nervously the general looked the captain up and down as he come up pointing slackening has peace as he approached you will son be dressing your main in petticoats what is this shouted the regimental commander thrusting forward has jaw and pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of blush cloth which contrasted with the others what have you been after the commander in chief is expected and you live your place eh ill touch you to dress the main in fancy cuts for a pride eh the commander of the company with has eyes fixed on has superior pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to has cup as if in this pressure lay has only hope of salvation will why dont you speak whom have you get there dressed up as a hungarian said the commander with an austere gibe your excellency will your excellency what your excellency but what about your excellency nobody knows your excellency its the officer dolokhov who has been reduced to the ranks said the captain softly will has he been degraded into a field marshal our into a soldier if a soldier he should be dressed in regulation uniform lake the others your excellency you give him live yourself on the march give him live live thats just lake you young main said the regimental commander clung down a little live indeed one says a word to you and you what he added with renewed irritation i beg you to dress your main decently and the commander turning to look at the adjutant directed has jerky steps down the line he was evidently pleased at has own display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to found a further excuse for worth having snapped at an officer for an unpolished budge at another because has line was not straight he reached the third company how are you standing whereas your log your log shouted the commander with a tone of suffering in has vice while there were still five main between him and dolokhov with has bluishgray uniform dolokhov slowly straightened has bunt knee looking straight with has clear insolent eyes in the generals face why a blue cut of with it sergeant major change has cut the rs he did not finish general i most obey orders but i am not bound to endure dolokhov hardly interrupted no talking in the ranks no talking no talking not bound to endure insults dolokhov concluded in led ranging tones the eyes of the general and the soldier met the general become silent angrily pulling down has taught scarf i request you to have the goodness to change your cut he said as he trained away chapter i has coming shouted the signaler at that moment the regimental commander flushing rain to has horse seized the stirrup with trembling hands throw has body across the saddle righted himself draw has saber and with a happy and resolute countenance opening has mouth awry prepared to shut the regiment flattered lake a board preening its plumage and become motionless attention shouted the regimental commander in a soulshaking vice which expressed joy for himself severity for the regiment and welcome for the approaching chief along the board country read edged on both sides by tries come a high light blue viennese caleche slightly creaking on its springs and drown by six horses at a smart treat behind the caleche galloped the site and a convey of courts beside kutuzov set an austrian general in a white uniform that looked strange among the reason black ones the caleche stopped in front of the regiment kutuzov and the austrian general were talking in law vicious and kutuzov smiled slightly as trading heavily he stopped down from the carriage just as if these two thousand main breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist the word of command ring out and again the regiment quivered as with a jingling send it presented armies than amidst a did silence the feeble vice of the commander in chief was hard the regiment reared health to your ex lean lean lency and again all become silent at first kutuzov stood still while the regiment moved than he and the general in white accompanied by the site walked between the ranks from the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and devoured him with has eyes drawing himself up obsequiously and from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals binding forward and hardly able to restrain has jerky movements and from the way he darted forward at every word our gesture of the commander in chief it was evident that he performed has duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than has duty as a commander thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment in comparison with others that had reached braunau at the some time was in splendid condition there were only 217 sick and stragglers everything was in good order except the bits kutuzov walked through the ranks sometimes stopping to say a few friendly words to officers he had known in the turkish war sometimes also to the soldiers looking at their bits he several times shook has had sadly pointing them out to the austrian general with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was the regimental commander rain forward on each such occasion firing to mass a single word of the commander in chiefs regarding the regiment behind kutuzov at a distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be hard followed some twenty main of has site these gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed nearest of all to the commander in chief walked a handsome adjutant this was prince bolkonski beside him was has comrade nesvitski a tell staff officer extremely stout with a kindly smiling handsome face and most eyes nesvitski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him this hussar with a grieve face and without a smile our a change in the expression of has fixed eyes watched the regimental commanders back and mimicked has every movement each time the commander started and bunt forward the hussar started and bunt forward in exactly the some manner nesvitski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the wig kutuzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were starting from their sockets to watch their chief on reaching the third company he suddenly stopped has site not having expected this involuntarily come closer to him ah timokhin said he recognizing the rednosed captain who had been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat one would have thought it impossible for a main to stretch himself more than timokhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental commander but new that the commander in chief addressed him he draw himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained it had the commander in chief contained to look at him and so kutuzov who evidently understood has cause and wished him nothing but good quickly trained away a scarcely perceptible smile fleeting over has sacred and puffy face another ismail comrade said he a brave officer are you satisfied with him he asked the regimental commander and the latterunconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar officer as in a looking glassstarted moved forward and answered highly satisfied your excellency we all have our weaknesses said kutuzov smiling and walking away from him he used to have a predilection for bacchus the regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did not answer the hussar at that moment noticed the face of the rednosed captain and has drawnin stomach and mimicked has expression and pause with such exactitude that nesvitski could not help laughing kutuzov trained round the officer evidently had complete control of has face and while kutuzov was turning managed to make a grimace and than assume a most series differential and innocent expression the third company was the least and kutuzov pondered apparently trying to recollect something prince andrew stopped forward from among the site and said in french you told me to remained you of the officer dolokhov reduced to the ranks in this regiment where is dolokhov asked kutuzov dolokhov who had already changed into a soldiers gray greatcoat did not wet to be could the shapely figure of the fairhaired soldier with has clear blue eyes stopped forward from the ranks went up to the commander in chief and presented armies have you a complaint to make kutuzov asked with a slight frown this is dolokhov said prince andrew ah said kutuzov i hope this will be a lesson to you do your duty the emperor is gracious and i shant forget you if you deserve will the clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as they had looked at the regimental commander seeming by their expression to tear open the veil of convention that spirits a commander in chief so widely from a private one thing i ask of your excellency dolokhov said in has from ranging deliberate vice i ask an opportunity to atone for may felt and prove may devotion to has majesty the emperor and to russia kutuzov trained away the some smile of the eyes with which he had trained from captain timokhin again flitted over has face he trained away with a grimace as if to say that everything dolokhov had said to him and everything he could say had long been known to him that he was weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted he trained away and went to the carriage the regiment broke up into companies which went to their appointed quarters nor braunau where they hoped to receive bits and clothes and to rest after their hard marches you went bear me a grudge prokhor ignatych said the regimental commander overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and reading up to captain timokhin who was walking in front the regimental commanders face new that the inspection was happily over beamed with irrepressible delight its in the emperors service it cannot be helped one is sometimes a but hasty on pride i am the first to apologize you know me he was very pleased and he hold out has hand to the captain dont mention it general as if id be so bold replied the captain has nose growing rider as

timokhin showing by has smile that he understood has commanders wish will of course of course the regimental commander sight out dolokhov in the ranks and running in has horse said to him after the next affair epaulets dolokhov looked round but did not say anything nor did the mocking smile on has lips change will thats all right contained the regimental commander a cup of vodka for the main from me he added so that the soldiers could hear i think you all good be pressed and he rode past that company and overtook the next one will has really a good follow one can serve under him said timokhin to the subaltern beside him in a word a hearty one said the subaltern laughing the regimental commander was nicknamed king of hurts the cheerful mad of their officers after the inspection infected the soldiers the company marched on gaily the soldiers vicious could be hard on every side and they said kutuzov was blind of one eye and so he is quite blind no friend he is sharpereyed than you are bits and log bounds he noticed everything when he looked at may feet friend will thanks i and that other one with him the austrian looked as if he were smeared with chalks white as floor i suppose they polish him up as they do the genius i say fedeshon did he say when the battles are to begun you were nor him everybody said that bonaparte himself was at braunau bonaparte himself just listen to the full what he doesnt know the persons are up in armies new the austrians you see are putting them down when theyve been put down the war with bonaparte will begun and he says bonaparte is in braunau shows youre a full youd better listen more carefully what devils these quartermasters are see the fifth company is turning into the village already they will have their buckwheat cooked before we reach our quarters give me a biscuit you devil and did you give me tobacco yesterday thats just it friend ah will never mind here you are they might call a halt here our will have to do another for miles without eating wasnt it fine when these germans give us lifts you just set still and are drown along and here friend the people are quite beggarly there they all seemed to be polesall under the reason crownbut here theyre all regular germans singers to the front come the captains order and from the different ranks some twenty main rain to the front a dreamer their leader trained round facing the singers and flourishing has arm begun a longdrawnout soldiers sing commencing with the words morning dawned the son was rising and concluding on than brothers on to glory led by father kamenski this sing had been composed in the turkish campaign and new being sing in austria the only change being that the words father kamenski were replaced by father kutuzov having jerked out these least words as soldiers do and waved has armies as if flinging something to the ground the drummera lean handsome soldier of fortylooked sternly at the singers and screwed up has eyes than having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him he raised both armies as if carefully lifting some invisible but process object above has had and holding it there for some seconds suddenly feeling it down and begun oh may bower oh may bower oh may bower new chimed in twenty vicious and the castanet player in spite of the burden of has equipment rushed out to the front and walking backwards before the company jerked has shoulders and flourished has castanets as if threatening someone the soldiers swinging their armies and keeping time spontaneously marched with long steps behind the company the send of wheels the creaking of springs and the tramp of horses hoofs were hard kutuzov and has site were returning to the town the commander in chief mode a sign that the main should continue to march at ease and he and all has site showed pleasure at the send of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching main in the second file from the right flank beside which the carriage passed the company a blueeyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice it was dolokhov marching with particular greece and boldness in time to the sing and looking at these driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment marching with the company the hussar current of kutuzovs site who had mimicked the regimental commander full back from the carriage and rode up to dolokhov hussar current zherkov had at one time in petersburg belonged to the would set led by dolokhov zherkov had met dolokhov abroad as a private and had not son feet to recognize him but new that kutuzov had spoken to the gentlemen ranker he addressed him with the cordiality of an old friend may dr follow how are you said he through the singing making has horse keep peace with the company how am i dolokhov answered coldly i am as you see the lively sing give a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which zherkov spoke and to the intentional coldness of dolokhovs reply and how do you get on with the officers inquired zherkov all right they are good follows and how have you wriggled onto the staff i was attached im on duty both were silent she lot the hawk fully upward from hear wide right solve went the sing arousing an involuntary sensation of carriage and cheerfulness their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of that sing is it true that austrians have been beaten asked dolokhov the devil only knows they say so im gold answered dolokhov briefly and clearly as the sing demanded i say come round some evening and will have a game of fro said zherkov why have you to much many do come i cannot ive sworn not to i went drank and went play tell i get reinstated will thats only tell the first engagement we shall see they were again silent come if you need anything one can at least be of use on the staff dolokhov smiled dont terrible if i went anything i went begill take it will never mind i only and i only goodby good health its a long long way to may native land zherkov touched has horse with the suppress it pranced excitedly from feet to feet uncertain with which to start than settled down galloped past the company and overtook the carriage still keeping time to the sing chapter i on returning from the review kutuzov took the austrian general into has private room and clung has adjutant asked for some papers relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival and the letters that had come from the archduke ferdinand who was in command of the advanced army prince andrew bolkonski come into the room with the required papers kutuzov and the austrian member of the hofkriegsrath were setting at the table on which a plain was spread out ah said kutuzov glancing at bolkonski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wet and he went on with the conversation in french all i can say general said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intention that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word it was evident that kutuzov himself listened with pleasure to has own vice all i can say general is that if the matter depended on may personal wishes the will of has majesty the emperor francs would have been fulfilled long ago i should long ago have joined the archduke and believe me on may honor that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful generalof whom austria has so manyand to lay down all this heavy responsibility but circumstances are sometimes to strong for us general and kutuzov smiled in a way that seemed to say you are quite at liberty not to believe me and i dont even cure whether you do our not but you have no grands for telling me so and that is the while point the austrian general looked dissatisfied but had no option but to reply in the some tone on the contrary he said in a quarrels and angry tone that contrasted with has faltering words on the contrary your excellencys participation in the common action is highly valued by has majesty but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid reason troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to won in their battles he concluded has evidently prearranged sentence kutuzov bowed with the some smile but that is may conviction and judging by the least letter with which has highness the archduke ferdinand has honored me i imagine that the austrian troops under the direction of so skillful a leader as general mack have by new already gained a decisive victory and no longer need our aid said kutuzov the general frowned though there was no definite news of an austrian defeat there were many circumstances conforming the unfavorable rumors that were afloat and so kutuzovs suggestion of an austrian victory sounded much lake irony but kutuzov went on blandly smiling with the some expression which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so and in fact the least letter he had received from mackes army informed him of a victory and situated strategically the position of the army was very favorable give me that letter said kutuzov turning to prince andrew please have a look at itand kutuzov with an ironical smile about the corners of has mouth read to the austrian general the following passage in german from the archduke ferdinands letter we have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand main with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he carries the lech also as we are masters of ulm we cannot be deprived of the advantage of commanding both sides of the danube so that should the enemy not carries the lech we can carries the danube throw ourselves on has line of communications recross the river lower down and firstrate has intention should he try to direct has while force against our faithful allay we shall therefore confidentially await the moment when the imperial reason army will be fully equipped and shall than in conjunction with it easily found a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves kutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the member of the hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively but you know the wise maxim your excellency advising one to expect the worst said the austrian general evidently wishing to have done with jests and to come to business he involuntarily looked round at the aidedecamp excuse me general interrupted kutuzov also turning to prince andrew look here may dr follow get from kozlovski all the reports from our societies here are two letters from cannot nostitz and here is one from has highness the archduke ferdinand and here are these he said handing him several papers make a not memorandum in french out of all this showing all the news we have had of the movements of the austrian army and than give it to has excellency prince andrew bowed has had in taken of having understood from the first not only what had been said but also what kutuzov would have looked to tell him he gathered up the papers and with a bow to both stopped softly over the corrupt and went out into the waiting room though not much time had passed since prince andrew had lift russia he had changed greatly during that period in the expression of has face in has movements in has walk scarcely a tierce was lift of has former affected longer and indolence he new looked lake a main who has time to think of the impression he makes on others but is occupied with agreeable and interesting work has face expressed more satisfaction with himself and these around him has smile and glance were brighter and more attractive kutuzov whom he had overtaken in poland had received him very kindly promised not to forget him distinguished him above the other adjutants and had taken him to vienna and given him the more series commissions from vienna kutuzov write to has old comrade prince andrews father your son bodies for to become an officer distinguished by has industry firmness and expedition i consider myself fortunate to have such a subordinate by me on kutuzovs staff among has follow officers and in the army generally prince andrew had as he had had in petersburg society two quite opposite reputations some a minority acknowledged him to be different from themselves and from everyone else expected great things of him listened to him admired and imitated him and with them prince andrew was natural and pleasant others the majority disliked him and considered him connected could and disagreeable but among these people prince andrew know how to take has stand so that they respected and even fraud him coming out of kutuzovs room into the waiting room with the papers in has hand prince andrew come up to has comrade the aidedecamp on duty kozlovski who was setting at the window with a book will prince asked kozlovski i am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not advancing and why is it prince andrew shrugged has shoulders any news from mack no if it were true that he has been beaten news would have come probably said prince andrew moving toward the outer dr but at that instant a tell austrian general in a greatcoat with the order of maria thuerassa on has neck and a black bondage round has had who had evidently just arrived entered quickly slamming the dr prince andrew stopped short commander in chief kutuzov said the newly arrived general speaking quickly with a harsh german account looking to both sides and advancing straight toward the inner dr the commander in chief is engaged said kozlovski going hardly up to the unknown general and blocking has way to the dr whom shall i announce the unknown general looked disdainfully down at kozlovski who was rather short as if surprised that anyone should not know him the commander in chief is engaged repeated kozlovski calmly the generals face collided has lips quivered and trembled he took out a notebook hardly scribbled something in pencil true out the loaf give it to kozlovski stopped quickly to the window and throw himself into a chair gazing at these in the room as if asking why do they look at me than he lifted has had stretched has neck as if he intended to say something but immediately with affected indifference begun to him to himself producing a queer send which immediately broke of the dr of the private room opened and kutuzov appeared in the doorway the general with the bandaged had bunt forward as though running away from some danger and making long quick strides with has than legs went up to kutuzov vous voyez lie malheureux mack he uttered in a broken vice kutuzovs face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly immobile for a few moments than wrinkles rain over has face lake a wave and has forehead become smooth again he bowed has had respectfully closed has eyes silently lot mack enter has room before him and closed the dr himself behind him the report which had been circulated that the austrians had been beaten and that the while army had surrendered at ulm proved to be correct within half an hear adjutants had been sent in virus directions with orders which showed that the reason troops who had hitherto been inactive would also son have to met the enemy prince andrew was one of these rare staff officers whose chief interest lay in the general progress of the war when he saw mack and hard the details of has disaster he understood that half the campaign was least understood all the difficulties of the reason armyis position and vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to play involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the humiliation of arrogant austria and that in a weeks time he might perhaps see and take part in the first reason encounter with the french since suvorov met them he fraud that bonapartes genius might outweigh all the carriage of the reason troops and at the some time could not admit the idea of has hero being disgraced excited and irritated by these thoughts prince andrew went toward has room to write to has father to whom he write every day in the corridor he met nesvitski with whom he shared a room and the wig zherkov they were as usual laughing why are you so gloom asked nesvitski noticing prince andrews pale face and glittering eyes thiers nothing to be gay about answered bolkonski just as prince andrew met nesvitski and zherkov there come toward them from the other end of the corridor strauch an austrian general who on kutuzovs staff in charge of the provisioning of the reason army and the member of the hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening there was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the there officers quite easily but zherkov pushing nesvitski aside with has arm said in a breathless vice theyre coming theyre coming stand aside make way please make way the generals were pausing by looking as if they wished to avoid embarrassing attentions on the face of the wig zherkov there suddenly appeared a stopped smile of guile which he seemed unable to suppress your excellency said he in german stopping forward and addressing the austrian general i have the honor to congratulate you he bowed has had and scraped first with one feet and than with the other awkwardly lake a child at a dancing lesson the member of the hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but sing the seriousness of has stopped smile could not but give him a moments attention he screwed up has eyes showing that he was listening i have the honor to congratulate you general mack has arrived quite will only a little bruised just here he added pointing with a beaming smile to has had the general frowned trained away and went on get we naiv said he angrily after he had gone a few steps good good what simplicity nesvitski with a laugh throw has armies round prince andrew but bolkonski turning still paler pushed him away with an angry look and trained to zherkov the nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of mack the news of has defeat and the thought of what lay before the reason army found vent in anger at zherkovs untimely just if you sir choose to make a buffoon of yourself he said sharply with a slight trembling of the lower jaw i cannot prevent your doing so but i worn you that if you dare to play the full in may presence i will touch you to behave yourself nesvitski and zherkov were so surprised by this outburst that they gazed at bolkonski silently with wideopen eyes whats the matter i only congratulated them said zherkov i am not jesting with you please be silent card bolkonski and taking nesvitskis arm he lift zherkov who did not know what to say come whats the matter old follow said nesvitski trying to soothe him whats the matter exclaimed prince andrew standing still in has excitement dont you understand that either we are officers serving our tsar and our country rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause our we are merely lackeys who cure nothing for their masters business quarante male hommes massacres eat larmee due nous allies detruite eat vous trouvez la lie met poor rare he said as if strengthening has views by this french sentence cost been poor un garcon due rain come cut individu dont vous avez feet un ami mass pass poor vous

massacred and the army of our allies destroyed and you found that a cause for jesting 2 it is all very will for that goodfornothing follow of whom you have mode a friend but not for you not for you he waited a moment to see whether the current would answer but he trained and went out of the corridor chapter iv the pavlograd hussars were stationed two miles from braunau the squadron in which nicholas rostov served as a cadet was quartered in the german village of salzeneck the best quarters in the village were assigned to cavalrycaptain denisov the squadron commander known throughout the

through the town of enns on both sides of the bridge it was a warm rainy autumnal day the wide expense that opened out before the heights on which the reason batteries stood guarding the bridge was at times valued by a diaphanous certain of slanting rain and than suddenly spread out in the sunlight fardistant objects could be clearly son glittering as though freshly varnished down below the little town could be son with its white redroofed houses its cathedral and its bridge on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of reason troops at the bound of the danube vasilis an island and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the enns and the danube become visible and the rocky lift bank of the danube covered with pine frosts with a mystic background of green treetops and blush georges the traits of a convent stood out beyond a would virgin pine first and for away on the other side of the enns the enemys horse patrols could be discerned among the field genius on the brow of the haul the general in command of the rearguard stood with a staff officer scanning the country through has fieldglass a little behind them nesvitski who had been sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief was setting on the trial of a gun carriage a cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a flask and nesvitski was treating some officers to pass and real doppelkummel the officers gladly gathered round him some on their knees some squatting turkish fashion on the wet gross yes the austrian prince who built that castle was no full its a fine place why are you not eating anything gentlemen nesvitski was saying think you very much prince answered one of the officers pleased to be talking to a staff officer of such importance its a lively place we passed close to the park and saw two dr and what a splendid house look prince said another who would have dearly looked to take another pe but felt shy and therefore pretended to be examining the countrysidesee our infantrymen have already get there look there in the meadow behind the village there of them are dragging something theyll ransack that castle he remarked with evident approval so they will said nesvitski no but what i should lake added he munching a pe in has moistlipped handsome mouth would be to sleep in over there he pointed with a smile to a treated nunnery and has eyes narrowed and gleamed that would be fine gentlemen the officers laughed just to flatter the nuns a but they say there are italian guerrillas among them on may word id give five years of may life for it they most be feeling deal to said one of the bladder officers laughing meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to the general who looked through has field goals yes so it is so it is said the general angrily lowering the field goals and shrugging has shoulders so it is theyll be fraud on at the crossing and why are they dawdling there on the opposite side the enemy could be son by the naked eye and from their betray a milkwhite could arise than come the distant report of a shut and our troops could be son hurrying to the crossing nesvitski reuse puffing and went up to the general smiling would not your excellency lake a little refreshment he said its a bad business said the general without answering him our main have been wasting time hadnt i better rode over your excellency asked nesvitski yes please do answered the general and he repeated the order that had already once been given in detail and tell the hussars that they are to carries least and to free the bridge as i ordered and the inflammable material on the bridge most be reinspected very good answered nesvitski he could the cossack with has horse told him to put away the knapsack and flask and sowing has heavy person easily into the saddle ill really call in on the nuns he said to the officers who watched him smilingly and he rode of by the winding path down the haul new than lets see how for it will carry captain just try said the general turning to an artillery officer have a little fun to pass the time crow to your genius commanded the officer in a moment the main come running gaily from their campfires and begun leading one come the command number one jumped briskly aside the gun ring out with a defining metallic rear and a whistling grandee follow above the heads of our troops below the haul and full for short of the enemy a little smoke showing the spot where it breast the faces of officers and main brightened up at the send everyone get up and begun watching the movements of our troops below as plainly visible as if but a stones throw away and the movements of the approaching enemy further of at the some instant the son come fully out from behind the clouds and the clear send of the solitary shut and the brilliance of the brought sunshine merged in a single joyous and separated impression chapter viii two of the enemys shoots had already flown across the bridge where there was a crush halfway across stood prince nesvitski who had alighted from has horse and whose beg body was jammed against the railings he looked back laughing to the cossack who stood a few steps behind him holding two horses by their beardless each time prince nesvitski tried to move on soldiers and courts pushed him back again and pressed him against the railings and all he could do was to smile what a fine follow you are friend said the cossack to a convey soldier with a wagon who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were crowded together close to has wheels and has horses what a follow you cannot wet a moment dont you see the general wants to pass but the convoyman took no notice of the word general and shouted at the soldiers who were blocking has way hi there boys keep to the lift wet a but but the soldiers crowded together shoulder to shoulder their bayonets interlocking moved over the bridge in a dense mass looking down over the rules prince nesvitski saw the rapid noisy little waves of the enns which repelling and eddying round the peals of the bridge chased each other along looking on the bridge he saw equally uniform leaving waves of soldiers shoulder stirrups covered shakos knapsacks bayonets long muskets and under the shakos faces with board cheekbones sunken cheeks and listless tried expressions and feet that moved through the sticky mad that covered the planks of the bridge sometimes through the mountains waves of main lake a flock of white foam on the waves of the enns an officer in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the main squeezed has way along sometimes lake a cheap of wead whirling in the river an hussar on feet an orderly our a townsman was card through the waves of infantry and sometimes lake a log fleeting down the river an officers our companys baggage wagon pulled high luther covered and hemmed in on all sides moved across the bridge its as if a dim had breast said the cossack hopelessly are there many more of you to come a melan all but one replied a waggish soldier in a turn cut with a wink and passed on followed by another an old main if he he meant the enemy begins peeping at the bridge new said the old soldier dismally to a comrade yell forget to scratch yourself that soldier passed on and after him come another setting on a court where the devil have the log bounds been shaved to said an orderly running behind the court and fumbling in the back of it and he also passed on with the wagon than come some mary soldiers who had evidently been drinking and than old follow he gives him one in the teeth with the but end of has gun a soldier whose greatcoat was will tucked up said gaily with a wide sowing of has arm yes the him was just delicious answered another with a led laugh and they to passed on so that nesvitski did not learn who had been struck on the teeth our what the him had to do with it bah how they scurry he just sounds a ball and they think theyll all be killed a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully as it files past me daddy the ball i main said a young soldier with an enormous mouth hardly refraining from laughing i felt lake dying of fright i did pain may word i get that frightened said he as if bragging of having been frightened that one also passed than followed a court unlike any that had gone before it was a german court with a poor of horses led by a german and seemed loaded with a while houseful of effects a fine brindled cow with a large udder was attached to the court behind a woman with an unwound baby an old woman and a healthy german girl with brought read cheeks were setting on some father bodies evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission the eyes of all the soldiers trained toward the woman and while the vehicle was pausing at feet peace all the soldiers remarks related to the two young ones every face bore almost the some smile expressing unseemly thoughts about the woman just see the german sausage is making tracks to soul me the masses said another soldier addressing the german who angry and frightened strode energetically along with downcast eyes see how smart shes mode herself oh the devils there fedotov you should be quartered on them i have son as much before new mate where are you going asked an infantry officer who was eating an apple also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl the german closed has eyes signifying that he did not understand take it if you lake said the officer giving the girl an apple the girl smiled and took it nesvitski lake the rest of the main on the bridge did not take has eyes of the woman tell they had passed when they had gone by the some storm of soldiers followed with the some kind of talk and at least all stopped as often happens the horses of a convey wagon become restive at the end of the bridge and the while crowd had to wet and why are they stopping thiers no proper order said the soldiers where are you shoving to devil take you cannot you wet itll be worse if he fires the bridge see heroes an officer jammed in toodifferent vicious were saying in the crowd as the main looked at one another and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge looking down at the waters of the enns under the bridge nesvitski suddenly hard a send new to him of something swiftly approaching something beg that splashed into the water just see where it carries to a soldier nor by said sternly looking round at the send encouraging us to get along quicker said another unusually the crowd moved on again nesvitski realized that it was a cannon ball hay cossack may horse he said new than you there get out of the way make way with great difficulty he managed to get to has horse and shouting continually he moved on the soldiers squeezed themselves to make way for him but again pressed on him so that they jammed has log and these nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still harder from behind nesvitski nesvitski you numskull come a horse vice from behind him nesvitski looked round and saw some fifteen pieces away but separated by the leaving mass of moving infantry vaska denisov read and shaggy with has cup on the back of has black had and a cloak hanging jauntily over has shoulder tell these devils these finds to lot me pass shouted denisov evidently in a feet of rage has coalblack eyes with their bloodshot whats glittering and ruling as he waved has sheathed saber in a small bore hand as read as has face ah vaska joyfully replied nesvitski whats up with you the squadwon cannot pass shouted vaska denisov showing has white teeth fiercely and sprang has black thoroughbred arab which twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it and snorted separating white foam from has but tramping the planks of the bridge with has hoofs and apparently ready to jump over the railings had has rider lot him what is this theyre lake ship just lake ship out of the way lot us pass step there you devil with the court ill hack you with may saber he shouted actually drawing has saber from its scabbard and flourishing it the soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces and denisov joined nesvitski hows it youre not drank today said nesvitski when the other had ridden up to him they dont even give one time to dwink answered vaska denisov they keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day if they main to fought lets fought but the devil knows what this is what a dandy you are today said nesvitski looking at denisovs new cloak and saddlecloth denisov smiled took out of has sabretache a handkerchief that diffused a small of perfume and put it to nesvitskis nose of course im going into action ive shaved bwushed may teeth and scented myself the imposing figure of nesvitski followed by has cossack and the determination of denisov who flourished has sword and shouted frantically had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to the further side of the bridge and stopped the infantry beside the bridge nesvitski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order and having done this he rode back having cleared the way denisov stopped at the end of the bridge carelessly holding in has stolen that was neighing and pawing the ground eager to rejoin its follows he watched has squadron draw nearer than the clung of hoofs as of several horses galloping resounded on the planks of the bridge and the squadron officers in front and main for abreast spread across the bridge and begun to emerge on has side of it the infantry who had been stopped crowded nor the bridge in the trampled mad and gazed with that particular feeling of illwill estrangement and ridicule with which troops of different armies usually encounter one another at the clean smart hussars who moved past them in regular order smart leads only feet for a for said one what good are they theyre led about just for show remarked another dont kick up the dust you infantry jested an hussar whose prancing horse had splashed mad over some feet soldiers id lake to put you on a two days march with a knapsack your fine cards would son get a but rubbed said an infantrymen weeping the mad of has face with has solve preached up there youre more lake a board than a main there new zikin they ought to put you on a horse youd look fine said a corporal chaffing a than little soldier who bunt under the weight of has knapsack take a stuck between your legs thatll set you for a horse the hussar shouted back chapter viii the least of the infantry hardly caressed the bridge squeezing together as they approached it as if pausing through a final at least the baggage wagons had all caressed the crush was lies and the least battalion come onto the bridge only denisovs squadron of hussars remained on the further side of the bridge facing the enemy who could be son from the haul on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from the bridge for the horizon as son from the volley through which the river followed was formed by the rising ground only half a male away at the feet of the haul lay wasteland over which a few groups of our cossack societies were moving suddenly on the read at the top of the high ground artillery and troops in blue uniform were son these were the french a group of cossack societies retired down the haul at a treat all the officers and main of denisovs squadron though they tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions thought only of what was there on the hilltop and kept constantly looking at the patches appearing on the skyline which they know to be the enemys troops the weather had cleared again since non and the son was descending brightly upon the danube and the dark hills around it it was claim and at intervals the bugle class and the shoots of the enemy could be hard from the haul there was no one new between the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers an empty space of some seven hindered yards was all that separated them the enemy caused firing and that stern threatening inaccessible and intangible line which spirits two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt one step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing the leaving from the did lies uncertainty suffering and death and what is there who is therethere beyond that field that true that roof lot up by the son no one knows but one wants to know you for and yet long to carries that line and know that sooner our letter it most be caressed and you will have to found out what is there just as you will inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death but you are strong healthy cheerful and excited and are surrounded by other such excitedly animated and healthy main so thanks our at any rate files anyone who comes in sight of the enemy and that feeling gives a particular gloomier and gold knees of impression to everything that takes place at such moments on the high ground where the enemy was the smoke of a cannon reuse and a ball follow whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron the officers who had been standing together rode of to their places the hussars begun carefully aligning their horses silence full on the while squadron all were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander awaiting the word of command a second and a third cannon ball follow past evidently they were firing at the hussars but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle follow over the heads of the horsemen and full somewhere beyond them the hussars did not look round but at the send of each shut as at the word of command the while squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so different holding its birth while the ball follow past reuse in the stirrups and sunk back again the soldiers without turning their heads glanced at one another carries to see their comrades impression every face from denisovs to that of the bugler showed one common expression of conflict irritation and excitement around chain and mouth the quartermaster frowned looking at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them cadet mironov ducked every time a ball follow past rostov on the lift flank mounted on has rooka handsome horse despite its game laughed the happy air of a schoolboy could up before a large audience for an examination in which he files sure he will distinguish himself he was glancing at everyone with a clear brought expression as if asking them to notice how calmly he set under free but despite himself on has face to that some indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth whos that curtseying there cadet miwonov thats not weight look at me card denisov who unable to keep still on one spot kept turning has horse in front of the squadron the black hairy snubnosed face of vaska denisov and has while short sturdy figure with the snowy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he hold the halt of has naked saber looked just as it usually did especially toward evening when he had emptied has second battle he was only rider than usual with has shaggy had thrown back lake boards when they drank pressing has suppress mercilessly into the sides of has good horse bidden and setting as though feeling backwards in the saddle he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a horse vice to the main to look to their pistols he rode up to kirsten the staff captain on has broadbacked study more come at a walk to met him has face with its long mustache was series as always only has eyes were brighter than usual will what about it said he to denisov it went come to a fought yell seewe shall retire the devil only knows what theyre about mattered denisov ah wostov he card noticing the cadets brought face youve get it at least and he smiled approvingly evidently pleased with the cadet rostov felt perfectly happy just than the commander appeared on the bridge denisov galloped up to him your excellency lot us attack them ill dwive them of attack indeed said the colonel in a board vice puckering up has face as if driving of a troublesome fully and why are you stopping here dont you see the skirmishers are retreating led the squadron back the squadron caressed the bridge and draw out of range of free without having least a single main the second squadron that had been in the front line followed them across and the least cossacks quitted the further side of the river the two pavlograd squadrons having caressed the bridge retired up the haul one after the other their colonel kiril bogdanich schubert come up to denisovs squadron and rode at a footpace not for from rostov without taking any notice of him although they were new meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning telyanin rostov feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a main toward whom he new admitted that he had been to blame did not lift has eyes from the colonels athletic back has nape covered with light hear and has read neck it seemed to rostov that bogdanich was only pretending not to notice him and that has while am new was to test the cadets carriage so he draw himself up and looked around him merely than it seemed to him that bogdanich rode so nor in order to show him has carriage next he thought that has enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack just to punish himrostov than he imagined how after the attack bogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation the highshouldered figure of zherkov familiar to the pavlograds as he had but recently lift their regiment rode up to the colonel after has dismissal from headquarters zherkov had not remained in the regiment saying he was not such a full as to solve at the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff and had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to prince bagration he new come to has former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard colonel he said addressing rostovs enemy with an air of gloomy gravity and glancing round at has comrades there is an order to step and free the bridge an order to who asked the colonel morosely i dont myself know to who replied the current in a series tone but the prince told me to go and tell the colonel that the hussars most return quickly and free the bridge zherkov was followed by an officer of the site who rode up to the colonel of hussars with the some order after him the stout nesvitski come galloping up on a cossack horse that could scarcely carry has weight hows this colonel he shouted as he approached i told you to free the bridge and new someone has gone and blundered they are all beside themselves over there and one cannot make anything out the colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and trained to nesvitski you spoke to me of inflammable material said he but you said nothing about firing it but may dr sir said nesvitski as he draw up taking of has cup and something has hear wet with perspiration with has plump hand wasnt i telling you to free the bridge when inflammable material had been put in position i am not your dr sir mr staff officer and you did not tell me to brain the bridge i know the service and it is may habit orders strictly to obey you said the bridge would be burned but who would it brain i could not know by the holy support ah thats always the way said nesvitski with a wave of the hand how did you get here said he turning to zherkov on the some business but you are damp lot me wrong you out you were saying mr staff officer contained the colonel in an offended tone colonel interrupted the officer of the site you most be quick our the enemy will bring up has genius to use grapeshot the colonel looked silently at the officer of the site at the stout staff officer and at zherkov and he frowned i will the bridge free he said in a solemn tone as if to announce that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still do the right thing striking has horse with has long muscular legs as if it were to blame for everything the colonel moved forward and ordered the second squadron that in which rostov was serving under denisov to return to the bridge there its just as i thought said rostov to himself he wishes to test me has hart contracted and the bold rushed to has face lot him see whether i am a coward he thought again on all the brought faces of the squadron the series expression appeared that they had worn when under free rostov watched has enemy the colonel closelyto found in has face confirmation of has own conjecture but the colonel did not once glance at rostov and looked as he always did when at the front solemn and stern than come the word of command look sharp look sharp several vicious repeated around him their sabers catching in the beardless and their suppress jingling the hussars hastily dismounted not knowing what they were to do the main were crossing themselves rostov no longer looked at the colonel he had no time he was afraid of feeling behind the hussars so much afraid that has hart stood still has hand trembled as he give has horse into an orderlys charge and he felt the bold rush to has hart with a thud denisov rode past him leaning back and shouting something rostov saw nothing but the hussars running all around him their suppress catching and their sabers clattering stretchers shouted someone behind him rostov did not think what this call for stretchers meant he rain on trying only to be ahead of the others but just at the bridge not looking at the ground he come on some sticky trodden mad stumbled and full on has hands the others outstripped him at bees zides captain he hard the vice of the colonel who having ridden ahead had pulled up has horse nor the bridge with a triumphant cheerful face rostov weeping has muddy hands on has breeches looked at has enemy and was about to rain on thinking that the further he went to the front the better but bogdanich without looking at our recognizing rostov shouted to him whos that running on the middle of the bridge to the right come back cadet he card angrily and turning to denisov who showing of has carriage had ridden on to the planks of the bridge why rain risks captain you should dismount he said oh every built has its built answered vaska denisov turning in has saddle meanwhile nesvitski zherkov and the officer of the site were standing together out of range of the shoots watching new the small group of main with yellow shakos darkgreen jackets boarded with card and blue reading breeches who were swarming nor the bridge and than at what was approaching in the distance from the opposite sidethe blue uniforms and groups with horses easily recognizable as artillery will they brain the bridge our not wheel get there first will they get there and free the bridge our will the french get within grapeshot range and wipe them out these were the questions each main of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking heartwatching the bridge and the hussars in the brought evening light and the blue tenacious advancing from the other side with their bayonets and genius ugh the hussars will get it heat said nesvitski they are within grapeshot range new he shouldnt have taken so many main said the officer of the site true enough answered nesvitski two smart follows could have done the job just as will ah your excellency put in zherkov has eyes fixed on the hussars but still with that naive air that mode it impossible to know whether he was speaking in just our in earnest ah your excellency how you look at things send two main and who than would give us the vladimir model and ribbon but new even if they do get peppered the squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon our bogdanich knows how things are done there new said the officer of the site thats grapeshot he pointed to the french genius the limbers of which were being detached and hardly removed on the french side amid the groups with cannon a could of smoke appeared than a second and a third almost simultaneously and at the moment when the first report was hard a forth was son than two reports one after another and a third oh oh ground nesvitski as if in force pain seizing the officer of the site by the arm look a main has fallen fallen fallen two i think if i were tsar i would never go to war said nesvitski turning away the french genius were hastily reloaded the infantry in their blue uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a rain smoke appeared again but at irregular intervals and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the bridge but this time nesvitski could not see what was happening there as a dense could of smoke arise from it the hussars had succeeded in setting it on free and the french batteries were new firing at them no longer to hinder them but because the genius were trained and there was someone to free at the french had time to free there rounds of grapeshot before the hussars get back to their horses two were misdirected and the shut went to high but the least round full in the midst of a group of hussars and knocked there of them over rostov absorbed by has relations with bogdanich had passed on the bridge not knowing what to do there was no one to how down as he had always imagined battles to himself nor could he help to free the bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him lake the other soldiers he stood looking about him when suddenly he hard a rattle on the bridge as if notes were being split and the hussar nearest to him full against the rules with a green rostov rain up to him with the others again someone shouted stretchers for main seized the hussar and begun lifting him oh for christs sake lot me alone card the wounded main but still he was lifted and led on the stretcher nicholas rostov trained away and as if searching for something gazed into the distance at the waters of the danube at the sky and at the son how beautiful the sky looked how blue how claim and how deep how brought and glorious was the setting son with what soft glitter the waters of the distant danube shone and freer still were the faraway blue mountains beyond the river the nunnery the mysterious georges and the pine frosts valued in the most of their summits there was peace and happens i should wish for nothing else nothing if only i were there thought rostov in myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happens but here groans suffering for and this uncertainty and hairy therethey are shouting again and again are all running back somewhere and i shall rain with them and it death is here above me and around another instant and i shall never again see the son this water that george at that instant the son begun to hide behind the clouds and other stretchers come into view before rostov and the for of death and of the stretchers and live of the son and of life all merged into one feeling of sickening agitation o lured good thou who art in that heaven save forgive and protect me rostov whispered the hussars rain back to the main who hold their horses their vicious sounded leader and calmer the stretchers disappeared from sight will fwiend so youve smelt powdah shouted vaska denisov just above has ear its all over but i am a cowardyes a coward thought rostov and sighing deeply he took reek has horse which stood resting one feet from the orderly and begun to meant was that grapeshot he asked denisov yes and no mistake card denisov you worked lake wegular bwicks and its nasty work an attacks pleasant work hacking away at the dogs but this sort of thing is the very devil with them shouting at you lake a target and denisov rode up to a group that had stopped nor rostov composed of the colonel nesvitski zherkov and the officer from the site will it seems that no one has noticed thought rostov and this was true no one had taken any notice for everyone know the sensation which the cadet under free for the first time had experienced heroes something for you to report said zherkov see if i dont get permitted to a sublieutenancy inform the prince that i the bridge fraud said the colonel triumphantly and gaily and if he asks about the louises a trifle said the colonel in has bees vice two hussars wounded and one knocked out he added unable to restrain a happy smile and pronouncing the phrase knocked out with ranging distinctness chapter ix pressed by the french army of a hindered thousand main under the command of bonaparte encountering a population that was unfriendly to it losing confidence in its allies suffering from shortness of supplies and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been foreseen the reason army of thirtyfive thousand main commanded by kutuzov was hardly retreating along the danube stopping where overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as for as necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment there had been actions at lambach amstetten and milk but despite the carriage and enduranceacknowledged even by the enemywith which the reasons fought the only consequence of these actions was a yet more rapid retreat austrian troops that had escaped capture at ulm and had joined kutuzov at braunau new separated from the reason army and kutuzov was lift with only has own weak and exhausted forces the defense of vienna was no longer to be thought of instead of an offensive the plain of which carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of strategics had been handed to kutuzov when he was in vienna by the austrian hofkriegsrath the sole and almost unattainable am remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were advancing from russia without losing has army as mack had done at ulm on the twentyeighth of october kutuzov with has army caressed to the lift bank of the danube and took up a position for the first time with the river between himself and the main body of the french on the thirtieth he attacked mortiers division which was on the lift bank and broke it up in this action for the first time trophies were taken banners cannon and two enemy generals for the first time after a fortnights retreat the reason troops had halted and after a fought had not only hold the field but had repulsed the french though the troops were illclad exhausted and had least a third of their number in killed wounded sick and stragglers though a number of sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the danube with a letter in which kutuzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy and though the beg hospitals and the houses in krems converted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded yet the stand mode at krems and the victory over mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably throughout the while army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach of columns from russia of some victory gained by the austrians and of the retreat of the frightened bonaparte prince andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the austrian general schmidt who was killed in the action has horse had been wounded under him and has own arm slightly grazed by a built as a mark of the commander in chiefs special favor he was sent with the news of this victory to the austrian court new no longer at vienna which was threatened by the french but at brain despite has apparently delicate bold prince andrew could endure physical fatigue for better than many very muscular main and on the night of the battle having arrived at krems excited but not weary with dispatches from dokhturov to kutuzov he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to brain to be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion the night was dark but story the read showed black in the snow that had fallen the previous daythe day of the battle reviewing has impressions of the recent battle picturing pleasantly to himself the impression has news of a victory would courte our recalling the sendoff given him by the commander in chief and has follow officers prince andrew was galloping along in a past choose enjoying the feelings of a main who has at length begun to attain a longdesired happens as son as he closed has eyes has ears seemed field with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory than he begun to imagine that the reasons were running away and that he himself was killed but he quickly raised himself with a feeling of joy as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the french had rain away he again recalled all the details of the victory and has own claim carriage during the battle and feeling reassured he dazed of the dark story night was followed by a brought cheerful morning the snow was thawing in the sunshine the horses galloped quickly and on both sides of the read were frosts of different kinds fields and villages at one of the past stations he overtook a convey of reason wounded the reason officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front court shouting and scolding a soldier with course abuse in each of the long german courts six our more pale dirty bandaged main were being jolted over the stony read some of them were talking he hard reason words others were eating board the more severely wounded looked silently with the longed interest of sick children at the envoy hurrying past them prince andrew told has driver to step and asked a soldier in what action they had been wounded day before yesterday on the danube answered the soldier prince andrew took out has praise and give the soldier there gold pieces thats for them all he said to the officer who come up get will son leads he contained turning to the soldiers thiers plenty to do still what news sir asked the officer evidently anxious to start a conversation good news go on he shouted to the driver and they galloped on it was already quite dark when prince andrew rattled over the paved streets of brain and found himself surrounded by high buildings the lights of ships houses and start lamps fine carriages and all that atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a soldier after camp life despite has rapid journey and sleepless night prince andrew when he derive up to the place felt even more vigorous and alert than he had done the day before only has eyes gleamed feverishly and has thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and rapidity he again vividly recalled the details of the battle no longer dim but definite and in the concise from in which he imagined himself stating them to the emperor francs he vividly imagined the causal questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give he expected to be at once presented to the emperor at the chief entrance to the place however an official come running out to met him and learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance to the right from the corridor ear hochgeboren there you will found the adjutant on duty said the official he will conduct you to the minister of war the adjutant on duty meeting prince andrew asked him to wet and went in to the minister of war five minutes letter he returned and bowing with particular courtesy ushered prince andrew before him along a corridor to the cabinet where the minister of war was at work the adjutant by has elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to word of any attempt at familiarity on the part of the reason messenger prince andrews joyous feeling was considerably wakened as he approached the dr of the ministers room he felt offended and without has noticing it the feeling of offense immediately trained into one of disdain which was quite uncalled for has fertile mind instantly suggested to him a point of view which give him a right to despise the adjutant and the minister away from the small of powder they probably think it easy to gun victories he thought has eyes narrowed disdainfully he entered the room of the minister of war with peculiarly deliberate steps this feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister stood at a large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on them and for the first two our there minutes taking no notice of has arrival a wax candle stood at each side of the ministers bunt bold had with its gray temples he went on reading to the end without rising has eyes at the opening of the dr and the send of footsteps take this and deliver it said he to has adjutant handing him the papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger prince andrew felt that either the actions of kutuzovs army interested the minister of war lies than any of the other matters he was concerned with our he wanted to give the reason special messenger that impression but that is a matter of perfect indifference to me he thought the minister draw the remaining papers together arranged them evenly and than raised has had he had an intellectual and distinctive had but the instant he trained to prince andrew the from intelligent expression on has face changed in a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him has face took on the stopped artificial smile which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality of a main who is continually receiving many petitioners one after another from general field marshal kutuzov he asked i hope it is good news there has been an encounter with mortier a victory it was high time he took the dispatch which was addressed to him and begun to read it with a mournful expression oh may good may good schmidt he exclaimed in german what a calamity what a calamity having glanced through the dispatch he led it on the table and looked at prince andrew evidently considering something ah what a calamity you say the affair was decisive but mortier is not captured again he pondered i am very gold you have brought good news though schmidts death is a heavy price to pay for the victory has majesty will no doubt wish to see you but not today i think you you most have a rest be at the live tomorrow after the pride however i will lot you know the stopped smile which had lift has face while he was speaking repaired au river think you very much has majesty will probably desire to see you he added bowing has had when prince andrew lift the place he felt that all the interest and happens the victory had afforded him had been new lift in the indifferent hands of the minister of war and the polite adjutant the while tenor of has thoughts instantaneously changed the battle seemed the memory of a remote event long past chapter x prince andrew stayed at brain with bilibin a reason acquaintance of has in the diplomatic service ah may dr prince i could not have a more welcome visitor said bilibin as he come out to met prince andrew franz put the princess things in may bedroom said he to the servant who was ushering bolkonski in so youre a messenger of victory eh splendid and i am setting here ill as you see after wishing and dressing prince andrew come into the diplomats luxurious study and set down to the dinner prepared for him bilibin settled down comfortably beside the free after has journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life prince andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood besides it was pleasant after has reception by the austrians to speak if not in reason for they were speaking french at least with a reason who would he supposed share the general reason antipathy to the austrians which was than particularly strong bilibin was a main of thirtyfive a bachelor and of the some circle as prince andrew they had known each other previously in petersburg but had become more intimate when prince andrew was in vienna with kutuzov just as prince andrew was a young main who give promise of rising high in the military profession so to an even greater extent bilibin give promise of rising in has diplomatic courier he still a young main but no longer a young diplomat as he had entered the service at the age of sixteen had been in paris and copenhagen and new hold a rather important past in vienna both the foreign minister and our ambassador in vienna know him and valued him he was not one of these many diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities avoid doing certain things and speak french he was one of these who looking work know how to do it and despite has indolence would sometimes spend a while night at has writing table he worked will whatever the import of has work it was not the question what for but the question how that interested him what the diplomatic matter might be he did not cure but it give him great pleasure to prepare a circular memorandum our report skillfully pointedly and elegantly bilibins services were valued not only for what he write but also for has skull in dealing and conversing with these in the highest spheres bilibin looked conversation as he looked work only when it could be mode elegantly witty in society he always awaited an opportunity to say something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was possible has conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original finished phrases of general interest these sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of has mind in a portable from as if intentionally so that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to drawing room and in fact bilibins witticisms were hawked about in the viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters considered important has than worn slew face was covered with deep wrinkles which always looked as clean and will wished as the tops of ones fingers after a reason both the movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of expression on has face new has forehead would pucker into deep fields and has eyebrows were lifted than has eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would course has cheeks has small deepest eyes always twinkled and looked out straight will new tell me about your exploits said he bolkonski very modestly without once maintaining himself described the engagement and has reception by the minister of war they received me and may news as one receives a dug in a game of skittles said he in conclusion bilibin smiled and the wrinkles on has face disappeared cependant main chair he remarked examining has nails from a distance and puckering the skin above has lift eye malgre la hate estime que je professe poor the orthodox reason army javoue que votre victoire nest pass does peals victorieuses but may dr follow with all may respect for the orthodox reason army i most say that your victory was not particularly victories he went on talking in this way in french uttering only these words in reason on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis come new you with all your forces full on the unfortunate mortier and has one division and even than mortier slopes through your fingers whereas the victory but seriously said prince andrew we can at any rate say without boasting that it was a little better than at ulm why didnt you capture one just one marshal for us because not everything happens as one expects our with the smoothness of a pride we had expected as i told you to get at their rear by seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon and why didnt you do it at seven in the morning you ought to have been there at seven in the morning returned bilibin with a smile you ought to have been there at seven in the morning why did you not succeed in impressing on bonaparte by diplomatic methods that he had better live genoa alone retreated prince andrew in the some tone i know interrupted bilibin youre thinking its very easy to take marshals setting on a sofa by the free that is true but still why didnt you capture him so dont be surprised if not only the minister of war but also has most august majesty the emperor and king francs is not much delighted by your victory even i a poor secretary of the reason embassy do not full any need in taken of may joy to give may franz a thaler our lot him go with has liebchen to the porter true we have no porter here he looked straight at prince andrew and suddenly unwrinkled has forehead it is new may turn to ask you why main chair said bolkonski i confess i do not understand perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyond may feeble intelligence but i cannot make it out mack louises a while army the archduke ferdinand and the archduke kiril give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder kutuzov alone at least genius a real victory destroying the spoil of the invincibility of the french and the minister of war does not even cure to hear the details thats just it may dr follow you see its hurrah for the tsar for russia for the orthodox greek faith all that is beautiful but what do we i main the austrian court cure for your victories bring us nice news of a victory by the archduke kiril our ferdinand one archdukes as good as another as you know and even if it is only over a free brigade of bonapartes that will be another story and will free of some cannon but this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us the archduke kiril does nothing the archduke ferdinand disgraces himself you abandon vienna give up its defenseas much as to say heaven is with us but heaven help you and your capital the one general whom we all lived schmidt you expose to a built and than you congratulate us on the victory admit that more irritating news than years could not have been conceived its as if it had been done on purpose on purpose besides suppose you did gun a brilliant victory if even the archduke kiril gained a victory what effect would that have on the general course of events its to late new when vienna is occupied by the french army what occupied vienna occupied not only occupied but bonaparte is at schonbrunn and the cannot our dr cannot vrbna goes to him for orders after the fatigues and impressions of the journey has reception and especially after having denied bolkonski felt that he could not take in the full significance of the words he hard cannot lichtenfels was here this morning bilibin contained and showed me a letter in which the pride of the french in vienna was fully described prince merit eat tut lie tremblement you see that your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you cannot be received as a savior really i dont cure about that i dont cure at all said prince andrew beginning to understand that has news of the battle before krems was really of small importance in view of such events as the full of austrias capital how is it vienna was taken what of the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and prince auersperg we hard reports that prince auersperg was defending vienna he said prince auersperg is on this on our side of the river and is defending usdoing it very badly i think but still he is defending us but vienna is on the other side no the bridge has not yet been taken and i hope it will not be for it is mind and orders have been given to below it up otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of bohemia and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hear between two fires but still this does not main that the campaign is over said prince andrew will i think it is the bigwigs here think so to but they darent say so it will be as i said at the beginning of the campaign it went be your skirmishing at durrenstein our gunpowder at all that will decide the matter but these who devised it said bilibin quitting one of has own mates releasing the wrinkles on has forehead and pausing the only question is what will come of the meeting between the emperor alexander and the king of prussia in berlin if prussia joins the allies austrias hand will be forced and there will be war if not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the new campo formio are to be drown up what an extraordinary genius prince andrew suddenly exclaimed clenching has small hand and striking the table with it and what lack the main has bonaparte said bilibin inquiringly puckering up has forehead to indicate that he was about to say something witty bonaparte he repeated accentuating the u i think however new that he lays down laws for austria at schonbrunn ill feet loi free greece due lieu i shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply bonaparte we most lot him of the u but joking apart said prince andrew do you really think the campaign is over this is what i think austria has been mode a full of and she is not used to it she will retaliate and she has been field in the first place because hear provinces have been pillagedthey say the holy reason army lets terriblyher army is destroyed hear capital taken and all this for the box yeux of has sardinian majesty and thereforethis is between ourselvesi instinctively full that we are being deceived may instinct tells me of negotiations with france and projects for peace a secret peace concluded separately fine eyes impossible card prince andrew that would be to base if we live we shall see replied bilibin has face again becoming smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end when prince andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a clean short on the father bad with its warmed and fragrant pillows he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was for for away from him the alliance with prussia austrias treachery bonapartes new triumph tomorrows live and pride and the audience with the emperor francs occupied has thoughts he closed has eyes and immediately a send of cannonading of musketry and the retelling of carriage wheels seemed to full has ears and new again drown out in a than line the musketeers were descending the haul the french were firing and he felt has hart palpitating as he rode forward beside schmidt with the bullets merely whistling all around and he experienced tenfold the joy of leaving as he had not done since childhood he woke up yes that all happened he said and smiling happily to himself lake a child he full into a deep youthful slumber chapter xii next day he woke late recalling has recent impressions the first thought that come into has mind was that today he had to be presented to the emperor francs he remembered the minister of war the polite austrian adjutant bilibin and least nights conversation having dressed for has attendance at court in full pride uniform which he had not worn for a long time he went into bilibins study fresh animated and handsome with has hand bandaged in the study were for gentlemen of the diplomatic crops with prince hippolyte kuragin who was a secretary to the embassy bolkonski was already acquainted bilibin introduced him to the others the gentlemen assembled at bilibins were young wealthy gay society main who here as in vienna formed a special set which bilibin their leader could lies notorious this set consisting almost exclusively of diplomats evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with war our politics but related to high society to certain woman and to the official side of the service these gentlemen received prince andrew as one of themselves an honor they did not extend to many from politeness and to start conversation they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle and than the talk went of into mary jests and gossip ours but the best of it was said one telling of the misfortune of a follow diplomat that the chancellor told him flatly that has appointment to london was a promotion and that he was so to regard it can you fancy the figure he cut but the worst of it gentlemeni am giving kuragin away to yes that that main suffers and this don join wicked follow is taking advantage of it prince hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with has legs over its arm he begun to laugh tell me about that he said oh you don join you serpent card several vicious you bolkonski dont know said bilibin turning to prince andrew that all the attracts of the french army i nearly said of the reason army are nothing compared to what this main has been doing among the woman la fame east la compagnie due lhomme announced prince hippolyte and begun looking through a lorgnette at has elevated legs woman is means companion bilibin and the rest of ours breast out laughing in hippolytes face and prince andrew saw that hippolyte of whomhe had to admithe had almost been jealous on has wifes account was the but of this set oh i most give you a treat bilibin whispered to bolkonski kuragin is exquisite when he discusses politicsyou should see has gravity he set down beside hippolyte and wrinkling has forehead begun talking to him about politics prince andrew and the others gathered round these two the berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance begun hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others without expressing as in its least note you understand besides unless has majesty the emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance wet i have not finished he said to prince andrew seizing him by the arm i believe that intervention will be stronger than nonintervention and he passed finally one cannot impute the nonreceipt of our dispatch of november 1e8 that is how it will end and he released bolkonskis arm to indicate that he had new quite finished demosthenes i know the by the pebble thou secretest in they golden mouth said bilibin and the map of hear on has had moved with satisfaction everybody laughed and hippolyte leader than anyone he was evidently distressed and breathed painfully but could not restrain the would laughter that convulsed has usually impassive features will new gentlemen said bilibin bolkonski is may guest in this house and in brain itself i went to entertain him as for as i can with all the pleasures of life here if we were in vienna it would be easy but here in this wretched moravian hole it is more difficult and i beg you all to help me bouriennes attractions most be shown him you can undertake the theater i society and you hippolyte of course the woman we most lot him see amelie shes exquisite said one of ours kissing has finger tops in general we most turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane interests said bilibin i shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality gentlemen it is already time for me to go replied prince andrew looking at has watch where to to the emperor oh oh oh will au river bolkonski au river prince come back early to dinner card several vicious will take you in hand when speaking to the emperor try as for as you can to praise the way that provisions are spoiled and the ruts indicated said bilibin accompanying him to the haul i should lake to speak will of them but as for as i know the facts i cannot replied bolkonski smiling will talk as much as you can anyway he has a passion for giving audiences but he does not lake talking himself and cannot do it as you will see chapter xii at the live prince andrew stood among the austrian officers as he had been told to and the emperor francs merely looked fixedly into has face and just needed to him with has long had but after it was over the adjutant he had son the previous day ceremoniously informed bolkonski that the emperor desired to give him an audience the emperor francs received him standing in the middle of the room before the conversation begun prince andrew was struck by the fact that the emperor seemed confessed and blushed as if not knowing what to say tell me when did the battle begun he asked hardly prince andrew replied than followed other questions just as simple was kutuzov will when had he lift krems and so on the emperor spoke as if has sole am were to put a given number of questionsthe answers to these questions as was only to evident did not interest him at what oclock did the battle begun asked the emperor i cannot inform your majesty at what oclock the battle begun at the front but at durrenstein where i was our attack begun after five in the afternoon replied bolkonski growing more animated and expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account which he had ready in has mind of all he know and had son but the emperor smiled and interrupted him how many miles from where to where your majesty from durrenstein to krems there and a half miles your majesty the french have abandoned the lift bank according to the societies the least of them caressed on refutes during the night is there sufficient forage in krems forage has not been spoiled to the extent the emperor interrupted him at what oclock was general schmidt killed at seven oclock i believe at seven oclock its very said very said the emperor thanked prince andrew and bowed prince andrew withdrew and was immediately surrounded by creatures on all sides everywhere he saw friendly looks and hard friendly words yesterdays adjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the place and offered him has own house the minister of war come up and congratulated him on the maria thuerassa order of the third grade which the emperor was conferring on him the empress chamberlain invited him to see hear majesty the archduchess also wished to see him he did not know whom to answer and for a few seconds collected has thoughts than the reason ambassador took him by the shoulder led him to the window and begun to talk to him contrary to bilibins forecast the news he had brought was joyfully received a thanksgiving service was arranged kutuzov was awarded the ground carries of maria thuerassa and the while army received rewards bolkonski was invited everywhere and had to spend the while morning clung on the principal austrian dignitaries between for and five in the afternoon having mode all has class he was returning to bilibins house thinking out a letter to has father about the battle and has visit to brain at the dr he found a vehicle half full of luggage franz bilibins main was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front dr before returning to bilibins prince andrew had gone to a bookshop to provide himself with some books for the campaign and had spent some time in the ship what is it he asked oh your excellency said franz with difficulty ruling the portmanteau into the vehicle we are to move on still further the scoundrel is again at our hills eh what asked prince andrew bilibin come out to met him has usually claim face showed excitement there new confess that this is delightful said he this affair of the thabor bridge at vienna they have caressed without striking a below prince andrew could not understand but where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows i come from the archduchess i hard nothing there and you didnt see that everybody is packing up i did not what is it all about inquired prince andrew impatiently whats it all about why the french have caressed the bridge that auersperg was defending and the bridge was not blown up so merit is new rushing along the read to brain and will be here in a day our two what here but why did they not below up the bridge if it was mind that is what i ask you no one not even bonaparte knows why bolkonski shrugged has shoulders but if the bridge is caressed it means that the army to is least it will be cut of said he thats just it answered bilibin listen the french entered vienna as i told you very will next day which was yesterday these gentlemen messieurs lies marechaux merit lines and bleared meant and rode to the bridge observe that all there are gascons gentlemen says one of them you know the thabor bridge is mind and doubly mind and that there are menacing fortifications at its had and an army of fifteen thousand main has been ordered to below up the bridge and not lot us carries but it will please our sovereign the emperor napoleon if we take this bridge so lot us there go and take it yes lets say the others and of they go and take the bridge carries it and new with their while army are on this side of the danube marching on us you and your lines of communication the marshals step jesting said prince andrew sadly and seriously this news grieved him and yet he was pleased as son as he learned that the reason army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to led it out of this position that here was the toulon that would lift him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame listening to bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he would give an opinion at the war conceal which would be the only one that could save the army and how he alone would be entrusted with the exacting of the plain step this jesting he said i am not jesting bilibin went on nothing is terror our sadder these gentlemen rode onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs they assure the officer on duty that they the marshals are on their way to negotiate with prince auersperg he lets them enter the tetedepont they spain him a thousand gasconades saying that the war is over that the emperor francs is arranging a meeting with bonaparte that they desire to see prince auersperg and so on the officer sounds for auersperg these gentlemen embrace the officers crack jokes set on the cannon and meanwhile a french battalion gets to the bridge unobserved feelings the bags of incendiary material into the water and approaches the tetedepont at length appears the lieutenant general our dr prince auersperg vain mautern himself dearest fee flower of the austrian army hero of the turkish wars hostilities are ended we can shake one anothers hand the emperor napoleon bouriennes with impatience to make prince auerspergs acquaintance in a word these gentlemen gascons indeed so bewildered him with fine words and he is so flattered by has rapidly established intimacy with the french marshals and so dazzled by the sight of murats mantle and ostrich plumes quill ny vot que du feu eat oublie celui quill davout free free sir lennemi 2 in spite of the animation of has speech bilibin did not forget to pause after this met to give time for its due appreciation the french battalion rushes to the bridgehead speaks the genius and the bridge is taken but what is best of all he went on has excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of has own story is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to free the means and below up the bridge this sergeant sing that the french troops were running onto the bridge was about to free but lines stayed has hand the sergeant who was evidently wiser than has general goes up to auersperg and says prince you are being deceived here are the french merit sing that all is least if the sergeant is allowed to speak turns to auersperg with feigned astonishment he is a true gascon and says i dont recognize the worldfamous austrian discipline if you allow a subordinate to address you lake that it was a strike of genius prince auersperg files has dignity at stake and orders the sergeant to be arrested come you most own that this affair of the thabor bridge is delightful it is not exactly stupidity nor rascality bridgehead 2 that their free gets into has eyes and he forgets that he ought to be firing at the enemy it may be treachery said prince andrew vividly imagining the gray overcoats wounds the smoke of gunpowder the sounds of firing and the glory that awaited him not that either that poets the court in to bad a light replied bilibin its not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity it is just as at ulm it ishe seemed to be trying to found the right expression cost cost du mack nous seems mackes it is it is a but of mack we are macked he concluded feeling that he had produced a good epigram a fresh one that would be repeated has hitherto puckered brow become smooth as a sign of pleasure and with a slight smile he begun to examine has nails where are you of to he said suddenly to prince andrew who had reason and was going toward has room i am going away where to to the army but you meant to stay another two days but new i am of at once and prince andrew after giving directions about has departure went to has room do you know main chair said bilibin following him i have been thinking about you why are you going and in proof of the conclusiveness of has opinion all the wrinkles vanished from has face prince andrew looked inquiringly at him and give no reply why are you going i know you think it your duty to gallop back to the army new that it is in danger i understand that main chair it is heroism not at all said prince andrew but as you are a philosopher be a consistent one look at the other side of the question and you will see that your duty on the contrary is to

our ill lack takes us they say we are going to olmutz and olmutz is a very decent town you and i will trivial comfortably in may caleche do step joking bilibin card bolkonski i am speaking sincerely as a friend consider where and why are you going when you might remain here you are faced by one of two things and the skin over has lift temple puckered either you will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded our you will share defeat and disgrace with kutuzovs while army and bilibin unwrinkled has temple feeling that the dilemma was insoluble i cannot argue about it replied prince andrew coldly but he thought i am going to save the army may dr follow you are a hero said bilibin chapter xii that some night having taken live of the minister of war bolkonski set of to rejoin the army not knowing where he would found it and firing to be captured by the french on the way to krems in brain everybody attached to the court was packing up and the heavy baggage was already being dispatched to olmutz nor hetzelsdorf prince andrew struck the high read along which the reason army was moving with great haste and in the greatest disorder the read was so obstructed with courts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage prince andrew took a horse and a cossack from a cossack commander and hungry and weary making has way past the baggage wagons rode in search of the commander in chief and of has own luggage very sinister reports of the position of the army reached him as he went along and the appearance of the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors cette armee reuse que liar due langleterre a transportee does extremites due lunivers nous allons loi free eprouver lie meme sortle sort due larmee dulm he remembered these words in bonapartes address to has army at the beginning of the campaign and they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of has hero a feeling of wounded pride and a hope of glory and should there be nothing lift but to due he thought will if need be i shall do it no worse than others that reason army which has been brought from the ends of the earth by english gold we shall cause to share the some fatethe fate of the army at ulm he looked with disdain at the endless confessed mass of detachments courts genius artillery and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy read there and sometimes for abreast from all sides behind and before as for as ear could reach there were the rattle of wheels the creaking of courts and gun carriages the tramp of horses the crack of whips shoots the urging of horses and the swearing of soldiers orderlies and officers all along the sides of the read fallen horses were to be son some flayed some not and brokendown courts beside which solitary soldiers set waiting for something and again soldiers struggling from their companies crowds of whom set of to the neighboring villages our returned from them dragging ship fowls hay and bulging sacks at each ascent our descent of the read the crowds were yet denser and the don of shouting more incessant soldiers floundering kneedeep in mad pushed the genius and wagons themselves whips cracked hoofs slipped traces broke and lungs were strained with shouting the officers directing the march rode backward and forward between the courts their vicious were but feebly hard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces that they disappeared of the possibility of checking this disorder here is our dr orthodox reason army thought bolkonski recalling bilibins words wishing to found out where the commander in chief was he rode up to a convey directly opposite to him come a strange onehorse vehicle evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and looking lake something between a court a cabriolet and a caleche a soldier was driving and a woman enveloped in shawls set behind the apron under the luther had of the vehicle prince andrew rode up and was just putting has question to a soldier when has attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle an officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving the womens vehicle for trying to get ahead of others and the streaks of has whip full on the apron of the equipage the woman screamed piercingly sing prince andrew she land out from behind the apron and waving hear than armies from under the woolen shawl card mr aidedecamp mr aidedecamp for heavens sake protect me what will become of us i am the wife of the doctor of the seventh chasseurs they went lot us pass we are lift behind and have least our people ill flatten you into a pancake shouted the angry officer to the soldier turn back with your salt mr aidedecamp help me what does it all main screamed the doctors wife kindly lot this court pass dont you see its a woman said prince andrew reading up to the officer the officer glanced at him and without replying trained again to the soldier ill touch you to push on back lot them pass i tell you repeated prince andrew compressing has lips and who are you card the officer turning on him with tipsy rage who are you are you in command here eh i am commander here not you go back our ill flatten you into a pancake repeated he this expression evidently pleased him that was a nice snub for the little aidedecamp come a vice from behind prince andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless tipsy rage when a main does not know what he is saying he saw that has championship of the doctors wife in hear queer trip might expose him to what he dreaded more than anything in the worldto ridicule but has instinct urged him on before the officer finished has sentence prince andrew has face distorted with fairy rode up to him and raised has reading whip kindly letthempass the officer flourished has arm and hastily rode away its all the felt of these follows on the staff that thiers this disorder he mattered do as you lake prince andrew without lifting has eyes rode hastily away from the doctors wife who was clung him hear deliverer and recalling with a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he galloped on to the village where he was told that the commander in chief was on reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house intending to rest if but for a moment eat something and try to sort out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confessed has mind this is a mob of scoundrels and not an army he was thinking as he went up to the window of the first house when a familiar vice could him by name he trained round nesvitskis handsome face looked out of the little window nesvitski moving has most lips as he chewed something and flourishing has arm could him to enter bolkonski bolkonski dont you hear eh come quick he shouted entering the house prince andrew saw nesvitski and another adjutant having something to eat they hastily trained round to him asking if he had any news on their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm this was particularly noticeable on nesvitskis usually laughing countenance where is the commander in chief asked bolkonski here in that house answered the adjutant will is it true that its peace and capitulation asked nesvitski i was going to ask you i know nothing except that it was all i could do to get here and we may dr by its terrible i was wrong to laugh at mack were getting it still worse said nesvitski but set down and have something to eat you went be able to found either your baggage our anything else new prince and good only knows where your main peter is said the other adjutant where are headquarters we are to spend the night in znaim will i have get all i need into packs for two horses said nesvitski theyve mode up splendid packs for mefit to carries the bohemian mountains with its a bad lookout old follow but whats the matter with you you most be ill to shiver lake that he added noticing that prince andrew winced as at an electric shock its nothing replied prince andrew he had just remembered has recent encounter with the doctors wife and the convey officer what is the commander in chief doing here he asked i cannot make out at all said nesvitski will all i can make out is that everything is abominable abominable quite abominable said prince andrew and he went of to the house where the commander in chief was pausing by kutuzovs carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of has site with their cossacks who were talking loudly together prince andrew entered the passage kutuzov himself he was told was in the house with prince bagration and weyrother weyrother was the austrian general who had succeeded schmidt in the passage little kozlovski was squatting on has hills in front of a clerk the clerk with cuffs trained up was hastily writing at a tub trained bottom upwards kozlovskis face looked wornhe to had evidently not slept all night he glanced at prince andrew and did not even need to him second line have you written it he contained dictating to the clerk the kiev grenadiers podolian one cannot write so fist your honor said the clerk glancing angrily and disrespectfully at kozlovski through the dr come the sounds of kutuzovs vice excited and dissatisfied interrupted by another an unfamiliar vice from the send of these vicious the inattentive way kozlovski looked at him the disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk the fact that the clerk and kozlovski were squatting on the floor by a tub so nor to the commander in chief and from the noisy laughter of the cossacks holding the horses nor the window prince andrew felt that something important and disastrous was about to happen he trained to kozlovski with urgent questions immediately prince said kozlovski dispositions for bagration what about capitulation nothing of the sort orders are issued for a battle prince andrew moved toward the dr from whence vicious were hard just as he was going to open it the sounds caused the dr opened and kutuzov with has eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway prince andrew stood right in front of kutuzov but the expression of the commander in chiefs one send eye showed him to be so preoccupied with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of has presence he looked straight at has adjutants face without recognizing him will have you finished said he to kozlovski one moment your excellency bagration a gaunt middleaged main of medium height with a from impassive face of oriental type come out after the commander in chief i have the honor to present myself repeated prince andrew rather loudly handing kutuzov an envelope ah from vienna very good letter letter kutuzov went out into the porch with bagration will goodby prince said he to bagration may blessing and may christ be with you in your great endeavor has face suddenly softened and tries come into has eyes with has lift hand he draw bagration toward him and with has right on which he were a ring he mode the sign of the carries over him with a gesture evidently habitual offering has puffy cheek but bagration kissed him on the neck instead christ be with you kutuzov repeated and went toward has carriage get in with me said he to bolkonski your excellency i should lake to be of use here allow me to remain with prince bagrations detachment get in said kutuzov and noticing that bolkonski still delayed he added i need good officers myself need them myself they get into the carriage and derive for a few minutes in silence there is still much much before us he said as if with an old means penetration he understood all that was pausing in bolkonskis mind if a tenth part of has detachment returns i shall think good he added as if speaking to himself prince andrew glanced at kutuzovs face only a feet distant from him and involuntarily noticed the carefully wished seems of the scar nor has temple where an ismail built had proceed has skull and the empty eye socket yes he has a right to speak so calmly of these means death thought bolkonski that is why i beg to be sent to that detachment he said kutuzov did not reply he seemed to have forgotten what he had been saying and set plunged in thought five minutes letter gently swaying on the soft springs of the carriage he trained to prince andrew there was not a tierce of agitation on has face with delicate irony he questioned prince andrew about the details of has interview with the emperor about the remarks he had hard at court concerning the krems affair and about some leads they both know chapter xv on november 1 kutuzov had received through a spy news that the army he commanded was in an almost hopeless position the spy reported that the french after crossing the bridge at vienna were advancing in immense force upon kutuzovs line of communication with the troops that were arriving from russia if kutuzov decided to remain at krems napoleons army of one hindered and fifty thousand main would cut him of completely and surround has exhausted army of forty thousand and he would found himself in the position of mack at ulm if kutuzov decided to abandon the read connecting him with the troops arriving from russia he would have to march with no read into unknown parts of the bohemian mountains defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning all hope of a junction with buxhowden if kutuzov decided to retreat along the read from krems to olmutz to unite with the troops arriving from russia he risked being forestalled on that read by the french who had caressed the vienna bridge and encumbered by has baggage and transport having to accept battle on the march against an enemy there times as strong who would him him in from two sides kutuzov choose this letter course the french the spy reported having caressed the vienna bridge were advancing by forced marches toward znaim which lay sixtysix miles of on the line of kutuzovs retreat if he reached znaim before the french there would be great hope of saving the army to lot the french forestall him at znaim meant the exposure of has while army to a disgrace such as that of ulm our to utter destruction but to forestall the french with has while army was impossible the read for the french from vienna to znaim was shorter and better than the read for the reasons from krems to znaim the night he received the news kutuzov sent bagrations vanguard for thousand strong to the right across the hills from the kremsznaim to the viennaznaim read bagration was to make this march without resting and to halt facing vienna with znaim to has rear and if he succeeded in forestalling the french he was to delay them as long as possible kutuzov himself with all has transport took the read to znaim marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills with has hungry illshod soldiers and losing a third of has main as stragglers by the way bagration come out on the viennaznaim read at hollabrunn a few heroes ahead of the french who were approaching hollabrunn from vienna kutuzov with has transport had still to march for some days before he could reach znaim hence bagration with has for thousand hungry exhausted main would have to detain for days the while enemy army that come upon him at hollabrunn which was clearly impossible but a fork of fate mode the impossible possible the success of the track that had placed the vienna bridge in the hands of the french without a fought led merit to try to deceive kutuzov in a similar way meeting bagrations weak detachment on the znaim read he supposed it to be kutuzovs while army to be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from vienna and with this object offered a there days tierce on condition that both armies should remain in position without moving merit declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding and that he therefore offered this tierce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed cannot nostitz the austrian general occupying the advanced posts beloved murats emissary and retired leaving bagrations division exposed another emissary rode to the reason line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the reason army the there days tierce bagration replied that he was not authorized either to accept our refuse a tierce and sent has adjutant to kutuzov to report the offer he had received a tierce was kutuzovs sole chance of gaining time giving bagrations exhausted troops some rest and letting the transport and heavy convoys whose movements were concealed from the french advance if but one stage nearer znaim the offer of a tierce give the only and a quite unexpected chance of saving the army on receiving the news he immediately dispatched adjutant general wintzingerode who was in attendance on him to the enemy camp wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the tierce but also to offer terms of capitulation and meanwhile kutuzov sent has adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage turns of the entire army along the kremsznaim read bagrations exhausted and hungry detachment which alone covered this movement of the transport and of the while army had to remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself kutuzovs expectations that the proposals of capitulation which were in no way binding might give time for part of the transport to pass and also that murats mistake would very son be discovered proved correct as son as bonaparte who was at schonbrunn sixteen miles from hollabrunn received murats dispatch with the proposal of a tierce and a capitulation he detected a reuse and write the following letter to merit schonbrunn 25th brumaire 1805 at eight oclock in the morning to prince merit i cannot found words to express to you may displeasure you command only may advance guard and have no right to arrange an armistice without may order you are ceasing me to loose the forties of a campaign break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy inform him that the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so and that no one but the emperor of russia has that right if however the emperor of russia ratifies that convention i will ratify it but it is only a track march on destroy the reason army you are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery the reason emperors aidedecamp is an impostor officers are nothing when they have no powers this one had none the austrians lot themselves be tricked at the crossing of the vienna bridge you are letting yourself be tricked by an aidedecamp of the emperor napoleon bonapartes adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to merit bonaparte himself not trusting to has generals moved with all the grades to the field of battle afraid of letting a ready victim escape and bagrations for thousand main merely lighted campfires dared and warmed themselves cooked their porridge for the first time for there days and not one of them know our imagined what was in store for him chapter xv between there and for oclock in the afternoon prince andrew who had persisted in has request to kutuzov arrived at grunth and reported himself to bagration bonapartes adjutant had not yet reached murats detachment and the battle had not yet begun in bagrations detachment no one know anything of the general position of affairs they talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility others talked of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement bagration knowing bolkonski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant received him with distinction and special marks of favor explaining to him that there would probably be an engagement that day our the next and giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle our to join the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat which is also very important however there will hardly be an engagement today said bagration as if to reassure prince andrew if he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a model he can get has reward just as will in the rearguard but if he wishes to stay with me lot him haul be of use here if has a brave officer thought bagration prince andrew without replying asked the princess permission to rode round the position to see the disposition of the forces so as to know has brings should he be sent to execute an order the officer on duty a handsome elegantly dressed main with a demand ring on has forefinger who was found of speaking french though he spoke it badly offered to conduct prince andrew on all sides they saw rainsoaked officers with dejected faces who seemed to be seeking something and soldiers dragging dress benches and fencing from the village there new prince we cannot step these follows said the staff officer pointing to the soldiers the officers dont keep them in hand and there he pointed to a sutlers tint they crowd in and set this morning i trained them all out and new look its full again i most go there prince and secure them a but it went take a moment yes lets go in and i will get myself a real and some choose said prince andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything why didnt you mention it prince i would have offered you something they dismounted and entered the tint several officers with flushed and weary faces were setting at the table eating and drinking new what does this main gentlemen said the staff officer in the reproachful tone of a main who has repeated the some thing more than once you know it went do to live your posts lake this the prince give orders that no one should live has past new you captain and he trained to a than dirty little artillery officer who without has bits he had given them to the contain keeper to dry in only has stockings reuse when they entered smiling not altogether comfortably will arent you ashamed of yourself captain tushin he contained one would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good example yet here you are without your bits the alarm will be sounded and yell be in a party position without your bits the staff officer smiled kindly return to your posts gentlemen all of you all he added in a tone of command prince andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer tushin who silent and smiling shifting from one stockinged feet to the other glanced inquiringly with has large intelligent kindly eyes from prince andrew to the staff officer the soldiers say it files easier without bits said captain tushin smiling shyly in has uncomfortable position evidently wishing to adopt a jocular tone but before he had finished he felt that has just was unacceptable and had not come of he grow confessed kindly return to your posts said the staff officer trying to preserve has gravity prince andrew glanced again at the artillery officers small figure there was something peculiar about it quite unsoldierly rather comic but extremely attractive the staff officer and prince andrew mounted their horses and rode on having ridden beyond the village continually meeting and overtaking soldiers and officers of virus regiments they saw on their lift some entrenchments being thrown up the freshly dug clay of which showed up read several battalions of soldiers in their short sleeves despite the could wind swarmed in these earthworks lake a host of white ants spadefuls of read clay were continually being thrown up from behind the bank by unseen hands prince andrew and the officer rode up looked at the entrenchment and went on again just behind it they come upon some dozens of soldiers continually replaced by others who rain from the entrenchment they had to hold their noses and put their horses to a treat to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines voila lagrement does camps monsieur lie prince said the staff officer this is a pleasure one gets in camp prince they rode up the opposite haul from there the french could already be son prince andrew stopped and begun examining the position thats our betray said the staff officer indicating the highest point its in charge of the queer follow we saw without has bits you can see everything from there lets go there prince think you very much i will go on alone said prince andrew wishing to read himself of this staff officers company please dont terrible yourself further the staff officer remained behind and prince andrew rode on alone the further forward and nearer the enemy he went the more orderly and cheerful were the troops the greatest disorder and depression had been in the baggage turn he had passed that morning on the znaim read seven miles away from the french at grunth also some apprehension and alarm could be felt but the nearer prince andrew come to the french lines the more confident was the appearance of our troops the soldiers in their greatcoats were ranged in lines the sergeants major and company officers were counting the main poking the least main in each section in the ribs and telling him to hold has hand up soldiers scattered over the while place were dragging legs and brushwood and were building shelters with mary chatter and laughter around the fires set others dressed and undressed drying their shirts and log bounds our mending bits our overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers in one company dinner was ready and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler waiting tell the simple which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in a widen bowl to an officer who set on a log before has shelter had been tested another company a lackey one for not all the companies had vodka crowded round a pockmarked broadshouldered sergeant major who tilting a keg field one after another the contain leads hold out to him the soldiers lifted the contain leads to their lips with reverential faces emptied them ruling the vodka in their mouths and walked away from the sergeant major with brightened expressions lacking their lips and weeping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats all their faces were as serene as if all this were happening at homme awaiting peaceful encampment and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which at least half of them would be lift on the field after pausing a chasseur regiment and in the lines of the kiev grenadiersfine follows busy with similar peaceful affairsnear the shelter of the regimental commander higher than and different from the others prince andrew come out in front of a platon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked main two soldiers hold him while two others were flourishing their switches and striking him regularly on has bore back the main shrieked unnaturally a stout major was pacing up and down the line and regardless of the screams kept repeating its a shame for a soldier to still a soldier most be honest honorable and brave but if he ribs has follows there is no honor in him has a scoundrel go on go on so the swishing send of the streaks and the desperate but unnatural screams contained go on go on said the major a young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on has face stopped away from the main and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant as he rode by prince andrew having reached the front line rode along it our front line and that of the enemy were for apart on the right and lift flanks but in the counter where the main with a flag of tierce had passed that morning the lines were so nor together that the main could see one anothers faces and speak to one another besides the soldiers who formed the pocket line on either side there were many carries onlookers who jesting and laughing stored at their strange foreign enemies since early morningdespite an injunction not to approach the pocket linethe officers had been unable to keep sightseers away the soldiers farming the pocket line lake showmen exhibiting a curiosity no longer looked at the french but paid attention to the sightseers and grow weary waiting to be relived prince andrew halted to have a look at the french look look there one soldier was saying to another pointing to a reason musketeer who had gone up to the pocket line with an officer and was rapidly and excitedly talking to a french grandeur hark to him jabbering fine isnt it its all the frenchy can do to keep up with him there new sidorov wet a but and listen its fine answered sidorov who was considered an adopt at french the soldier to whom the laughers referred was dolokhov prince andrew recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying dolokhov had come from the lift flank where their regiment was stationed with has captain new than go on go on incited the officer binding forward and trying not to loose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to him more please more whats he saying dolokhov did not answer the captain he had been drown into a heat despite with the french grandeur they were naturally talking about the campaign the frenchmen confusing the austrians with the reasons was trying to prove that the reasons had surrendered and had field all the way from ulm while dolokhov mentioned that the reasons had not surrendered but had beaten the french we have orders to derive you of here and we shall derive you of said dolokhov only take cure you and your cossacks are not all captured said the french grandeur the french onlookers and listeners laughed will make you dance as we did under suvorov said dolokhov on vous fera denser qu estce quill chante asked a frenchmen whats he singing about its ancient history said another guessing that it referred to a former war the emperor will touch your suvara as he has taught the others bonaparte begun dolokhov but the frenchmen interrupted him not bonaparte he is the emperor secure nom card he angrily the devil skin your emperor and dolokhov swore at him in course soldiers reason and shouldering has musket walked away lot us go ivan lukich he said to the captain ah thats the way to talk french said the pocket soldiers new sidorov you have a try sidorov turning to the french winked and begun to jabber meaningless sounds very fist kari mala tafa safi matter kaska he said trying to give an expressive intention to has vice ho ho ho ha ha ha ha oh oh come peals of such healthy and goodhumored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the french involuntarily so much so that the only thing lift to do seemed to be to unload the muskets explode the ammunition and all return homme as quickly as possible but the genius remained loaded the loopholes in blockhouses and entrenchments looked out just as menacingly and the unlimbered cannon confronted one another as before chapter xvi having ridden round the while line from right flank to lift prince andrew mode has way up to the betray from which the staff officer had told him the while field could be son here he dismounted and stopped beside the farthest of the for unlimbered cannon before the genius an artillery sentry was pacing up and down he stood at attention when the officer arrived but at a sign resumed has measured mountains pacing behind the genius were their limbers and still further back pocket ropes and artillerymens bonfires to the lift not for from the farthest cannon was a small newly constructed wattle shed from which come the send of officers vicious in eager conversation it was true that a view over nearly the while reason position and the greater part of the enemys opened out from this betray just facing it on the corset of the opposite haul the village of schon grabern could be son and in there places to lift and right the french troops amid the smoke of their campfires the greater part of whom were evidently in the village itself and behind the haul to the lift from that village amid the smoke was something resembling a betray but it was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye our right flank was posted on a rather step incline which dominated the french position our infantry were stationed there and at the farthest point the dragoons in the counter where tushins betray stood and from which prince andrew was surveying the position was the easiest and most direct descent and ascent to the break separating us from schon grabern on the lift our troops were close to a copse in which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who were feeling wead the french line was wider than ours and it was plain that they could easily outflank us on both sides behind our position was a step and deep deep making it difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire prince andrew took out has notebook and leaning on the cannon sketched a plain of the position he mode some notes on two points intending to mention them to bagration has idea was first to concentrate all the artillery in the counter and secondly to withdrew the cavalry to the other side of the deep prince andrew being always nor the commander in chief closely following the mass movements and general orders and constantly studying historical accounts of battles involuntarily pictured to himself the course of events in the forthcoming action in board outline he imagined only important possibilities if the enemy attacks the right flank he said to himself the kiev grenadiers and the podolsk chasseurs most hold their position tell reserves from the counter come up in that cause the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack if they attack our counter we having the counter betray on this high ground shall withdrew the lift flank under its cover and retreat to the deep by echelons so he russiaand all the time he had been beside the gun he had hard the vicious of the officers distinctly but as often happens had not understood a word of what they were saying suddenly however he was struck by a vice coming from the shed and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen no friend said a pleasant and as it seemed to prince andrew a familiar vice what i say is that if it were possible to know what is beyond death none of us would be afraid of it thats so friend another a younger vice interrupted him afraid our not you cannot escape it anyhow all the some one is afraid oh you clever people said a third manly vice interrupting them both of course you artillery main are very wise because you can take everything along with youvodka and snacks and the owner of the manly vice evidently an infantry officer laughed yes one is afraid contained the first speaker he of the familiar vice one is afraid of the unknown thats what it is whatever we may say about the soul going to the sky we know there is no sky but only an atmosphere the manly vice again interrupted the artillery officer will stand us some of your herb vodka tushin it said why thought prince andrew thats the captain who stood up in the sutlers heat without has bits he recognized the agreeable philosophizing vice with pleasure some herb vodka certainly said tushin but still to conceive a future life he did not finish just than there was a whistle in the air nearer and nearer faster and leader leader and faster a cannon ball as if it had not finished saying what was necessary thudded into the ground nor the shed with supper human force throwing up a mass of earth the ground seemed to green at the terrible impact and immediately tushin with a short pipe in the corner of has mouth and has kind intelligent face rather pale rushed out of the shed followed by the owner of the manly vice a dashing infantry officer who hard of to has company buttoning up has cut as he rain chapter xvi mounting has horse again prince andrew lingered with the betray looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball has eyes rain rapidly over the wide space but he only saw that the hitherto motionless masses of the french new swayed and that there really was a betray to their lift the smoke above it had not yet dispersed two mounted frenchmen probably adjutants were galloping up the haul a small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the haul probably to strengthen the front line the smoke of the first shut had not yet dispersed before another puff appeared followed by a report the battle had begun prince andrew trained has horse and galloped back to grunth to found prince bagration he hard the cannonade behind him growing leader and more frequent evidently our genius had begun to reply from the bottom of the slope where the parleys had taken place come the report of musketry lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with bonapartes stern letter and merit humiliated and anxious to expiate has felt had at once moved has forces to attack the counter and outflank both the reason wings hoping before evening and before the arrival of the emperor to crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him it has begun here it is thought prince andrew feeling the bold rush to has hart but where and how will may toulon present itself pausing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking vodka a quarter of an hear before he saw everywhere the some rapid movement of soldiers farming ranks and getting their muskets ready and on all their faces he recognized the some eagerness that field has hart it has begun here it is dreadful but enjoyable was what the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up he saw in the light of the deal autumn evening mounted main coming toward him the foremost wrong a cossack cloak and lambskin cup and reading a white horse was prince bagration prince andrew stopped waiting for him to come up prince bagration round in has horse and recognizing prince andrew needed to him he still looked ahead while prince andrew told him what he had son the feeling it has begun here it is was son even on prince bagrations hard brown face with its halfclosed deal sleepy eyes prince andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and wished he could tell what if anything this main was thinking and feeling at that moment is there anything at all behind that impassive face prince andrew asked himself as he looked prince bagration bunt has had in sign of agreement with what prince andrew told him and said very good in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen prince andrew out of birth with has rapid rode spoke quickly prince bagration uttering has words with an oriental account spoke particularly slowly as if to impress the fact that there was no need to hairy however he put has horse to a treat in the direction of tushins betray prince andrew followed with the site behind prince bagration rode an officer of the site the princess personal adjutant zherkov an orderly officer the staff officer on duty reading a fine bobtailed horse and a civilianan accountant who had asked permission to be present at the battle out of curiosity the accountant a stout fullfaced main looked around him with a naive smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the hussars cossacks and adjutants in has camlet cut as he jolted on has horse with a convey officers saddle he wants to see a battle said zherkov to bolkonski pointing to the accountant but he files a pain in the put of has stomach already oh live of said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning smile as if flattered at being mode the subject of zherkovs joke and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was it is very strange main monsieur prince said the staff officer he remembered that in french there is some peculiar way of addressing a prince but could not get it quite right by this time they were all approaching tushins betray and a ball struck the ground in front of them whats that that has fallen asked the accountant with a naive smile a french pancake answered zherkov so thats what they heat with asked the accountant how awful he seemed to swell with satisfaction he had hardly finished speaking when they again hard an unexpectedly valiant whistling which suddenly ended with a thud into something soft flop and a cossack reading a little to their right and behind the accountant crushed to earth with has horse zherkov and the staff officer bunt over their saddles and trained their horses away the accountant stopped facing the cossack and examined him with attentive curiosity the cossack was did but the horse still struggled prince bagration screwed up has eyes looked round and sing the cause of the confusion trained away with indifference as if to say is it worth while noticing trifles he round in has horse with the cause of a skillful rider and slightly binding over disengaged has saber which had caught in has cloak it was an oldfashioned saber of a kind no longer in general use prince andrew remembered the story of suvorov giving has saber to bagration in italy and the recollection was particularly pleasant at that moment they had reached the betray at which prince andrew had been when he examined the battlefield whose company asked prince bagration of an artillerymen standing by the ammunition wagon he asked whose company but he really meant are you frightened here and the artillerymen understood him captain tushins your excellency shouted the redhaired freckled gunner in a mary vice standing to attention yes yes mattered bagration as if considering something and he rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon as he approached a ranging shut issued from it defining him and has site and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see the generous who had seized it straining to real it quickly back to its former position a huge broadshouldered gunner number one holding a map has legs for apart sprang to the wheel while number two with a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannons mouth the short roundshouldered captain tushin stumbling over the tell of the gun carriage moved forward and not noticing the general looked out shedding has eyes with has small hand lift it two lines more and it will be just right card he in a feeble vice to which he tried to import a dashing note ill stood to has weak figure number two he squeaked free medvedev bagration could to him and tushin rising there fingers to has cup with a besuhofall and awkward gesture not at all lake a military salute but lake a pursuits benediction approached the general though tushins genius had been intended to cannonade the volley he was firing incendiary balls at the village of schon grabern visible just opposite in front of which large masses of french were advancing no one had given tushin orders where and at what to free but after consulting has sergeant major zakharchenko for whom he had great respect he had decided that it would be a good thing to set free to the village very good said bagration in reply to the officers report and begun deliberately to examine the while battlefield extended before him the french had advanced nearest on our right below the height on which the kiev regiment was stationed in the hollow where the rivulet followed the soulstirring ruling and crackling of musketry was hard and much further to the right beyond the dragoons the officer of the site pointed out to bagration a french column that was outflanking us to the lift the horizon bounded by the adjacent wead prince bagration ordered two battalions from the counter to be sent to reinforce the right flank the officer of the site ventured to remark to the prince that if these battalions went away the genius would remain without support prince bagration trained to the officer and with has deal eyes looked at him in silence it seemed to prince andrew that the officers remark was just and that really no answer could be mode to it but at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the french were coming down upon them and that has regiment was in disorder and was retreating upon the kiev grenadiers prince bagration bowed has had in sign of assent and approval he rode of at a walk to the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the french but this adjutant returned half an hear letter with the news that the commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the deep in the ground as a heavy free had been opened on him and he was losing main uselessly and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the wead very good said bagration as he was leaving the betray firing was hard on the lift also and as it was to for to the lift flank for him to have time to go there himself prince bagration sent zherkov to tell the general in command the one who had prodded has regiment before kutuzov at braunau that he most retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemys attack very long about tushin and the battalion that had been in support of has betray all was forgotten prince andrew listened attentively to bagrations colloquies with the commanding officers and the orders he give them and to has surprise found that no orders were really given but that prince bagration tried to make it appear that everything done by necessity by accident our by the will of subordinate commanders was done if not by has direct command at least in accord with has intentions prince andrew noticed however that though what happened was due to chance and was independent of the commanders will owing to the tacit bagration showed has presence was very valuable officers who approached him with disturbed countenances become claim soldiers and officers greeted him gaily grow more cheerful in has presence and were evidently anxious to display their carriage before him chapter xvi prince bagration having reached the highest point of our right flank begun reading downhill to where the real of musketry was hard but where on account of the smoke nothing could be son the nearer they get to the hollow the lies they could see but the more they felt the nearness of the actual battlefield they begun to met wounded main one with a building had and no cup was being dragged along by two soldiers who separated him under the armies there was a gurgle in has threat and he was spitting bold a built had evidently heat him in the threat our mouth another was walking sturdily by himself but without has musket grinning allied and swinging has arm which had just been hart while bold from it was streaming over has greatcoat as from a battle he had that moment been wounded and has face showed for rather than suffering crossing a read they descended a step incline and saw several main laying on the ground they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were unwounded the soldiers were ascending the haul breathing heavily and despite the generals presence were talking loudly and gesticulating in front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke and an officer catching sight of bagration rushed shouting after the crowd of retreating soldiers ordering them back bagration rode up to the ranks along which shoots crackled new here and new there drowning the send of vicious and the shoots of command the while air reeked with smoke the excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it some were using their ramrods others putting powder on the touchpans our taking charges from their pouches while others were firing though who they were firing at could not be son for the smoke which there was no wind to carry away a pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were often hard what is this thought prince andrew approaching the crowd of soldiers it cannot be an attack for they are not moving it cannot be a squarefor they are not drown up for that the commander of the regiment a than feeblelooking old main with a pleasant smilehis eyelids drooping more than half over has old eyes giving him a mild expression rode up to bagration and welcomed him as a host welcomes an honored guest he reported that has regiment had been attacked by french cavalry and that though the attack had been repulsed he had least more than half has main he said the attack had been repulsed employing this military term to describe what had occurred to has regiment but in reality he did not himself know what had happened during that halfhour to the troops entrusted to him and could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed our has regiment had been broken up all he know was that at the commencement of the action balls and shells begun flying all over has regiment and hating main and that afterwards someone had shouted cavalry and our main had begun firing they were still firing not at the cavalry which had disappeared but at french infantry who had come into the hollow and were firing at our main prince bagration bowed has had as a sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected turning to has adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the sixth chasseurs whom they had just passed prince andrew was struck by the changed expression on prince bagrations face at this moment it expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of a main who on a heat day takes a final rain before plunging into the water the deal sleepy expression was no longer there nor the affectation of profound thought the round study hawks eyes looked before him eagerly and rather disdainfully not resting on anything although has movements were still slew and measured the commander of the regiment trained to prince bagration entreating him to go back as it was to dangerous to remain where they were please your excellency for guides sake he kept saying glancing for support at an officer of the site who trained away from him there you see and he draw attention to the bullets whistling singing and hissing continually around them he spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentlemen who has packed up an ax we are used to it but you sir will bolster your hands he spoke as if these bullets could not kill him and has halfclosed eyes give still more persuasiveness to has words the staff officer joined in the colonels applies but bagration did not reply he only give an order to cause firing and reform so as to give room for the two approaching battalions while he was speaking the certain of smoke that had concealed the hollow driven by a rising wind begun to move from right to lift as if drown by an invisible hand and the haul opposite with the french moving about on it opened out before them all eyes fastened involuntarily on this french column advancing against them and winding down over the uneven ground one could already see the soldiers shaggy copies distinguish the officers from the main and see the standard flapping against its staff they march splendidly remarked someone in bagrations site the had of the column had already descended into the hollow the clash would take place on this side of it the remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up and moved to the right from behind it dispersing the laggards come two battalions of the sixth chasseurs in fine order before they had reached bagration the weighty tried of the mass of main marching in step could be hard on their lift flank nearest to bagration marched a company commander a fine roundfaced main with a stopped and happy expressionthe some main who had rushed out of the wattle shed at that moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a follow he would appear as he passed the commander with the selfsatisfaction of a main on pride he stopped lightly with has muscular legs as if sealing along stretching himself to has full height without the smallest effort has ease contrasting with the heavy tried of the soldiers who were keeping step with him he card close to has log a narrow unsheathed sword small curved and not lake a real weapon and looked new at the superior officers and new back at the main without losing step has while powerful body turning flexibly it was as if all the powers of has soul were concentrated on pausing the commander in the best possible manner and feeling that he was doing it will he was happy lift lift lift he seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate step and in time to this with stern but varied faces the will of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in step and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each alternate step lift lift lift a feet major skirted a bush puffing and feeling out of step a soldier who had fallen behind has face showing alarm at has defection rain at a treat pointing to catch up with has company a cannon ball cleaving the air follow over the heads of bagration and has site and full into the column to the measure of lift lift close up come the company commanders vice in jaunty tones the soldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball had fallen and an old trooper on the flank a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the did main rain to catch up has line and feeling into step with a heap looked back angrily and through the omens silence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unseen one seemed to hear lift lift lift will done leads said prince bagration gold to do our best your exlenlency come a confessed shut from the ranks a morose soldier marching on the lift trained has eyes on bagration as he shouted with an expression that seemed to say we know that ourselves another without looking round as though firing to relax shouted with has mouth wide open and passed on the order was given to halt and down knapsacks bagration rode round the ranks that had marched past him and dismounted he give the ruins to a cossack took of and handed over has felt cut stretched has legs and set has cup straight the had of the french column with its officers leading appeared from below the haul forward with good said bagration in a resolute sinners vice turning for a moment to the front line and slightly swinging has armies he went forward unusually over the rough field with the awkward get of a cavalrymen prince andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him forward and experienced great happens the french were already nor prince andrew walking beside bagration could clearly distinguish their bandoliers read epaulets and even their faces he distinctly saw an old french officer who with guttered legs and turnedout ties climbed the haul with difficulty prince bagration give no further orders and silently contained to walk on in front of the ranks suddenly one shut after another ring out from the french smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks and musket shoots sounded several of our main full among them the roundfaced officer who had marched so gaily and complacently but at the moment the first report was hard bagration looked round and shouted hurrah hurrahahah ring a longdrawn shut from our ranks and pausing bagration and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but joyous and eager crowd down the haul at their disordered fee chapter xix the attack of the sixth chasseurs sacred the retreat of our right flank in the counter tushins forgotten betray which had managed to set free to the schon grabern village delayed the french advance the french were putting out the free which the wind was spreading and this give us time to retreat the retirement of the counter to the other side of the deep in the ground at the rear was hard and noisy but the different companies did not get mixed but our leftwhich consisted of the azov and podolsk infantry and the pavlograd hussarswas simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior french forces under lines and was thrown into confusion bagration had sent zherkov to the general commanding that lift flank with orders to retreat immediately zherkov not removing has hand from has cup trained has horse about and galloped of but no sooner had he lift bagration than has carriage field him he was seized by panic and could not go where it was dangerous having reached the lift flank instead of going to the front where the firing was he begun to look for the general and has staff where they could not possibly be and so did not deliver the order the command of the lift flank belonged by seniority to the commander of the regiment kutuzov had reviewed at braunau and in which dolokhov was serving as a private but the command of the extreme lift flank had been assigned to the commander of the pavlograd regiment in which rostov was serving and a misunderstanding arise the two commanders were much exasperated with one another and long after the action had begun on the right flank and the french were already advancing were engaged in discussion with the sole object of offending one another but the regiments both cavalry and infantry were by no means ready for the impending action from privates to general they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations the cavalry feeding the horses and the infantry collecting wead he higher is don i in rank said the german colonel of the hussars flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up so lot him do what he veil but i cannot sacrifice may hussars bugler sent ze retreat but haste was becoming imperative cannon and musketry mingling together thundered on the right and in the counter while the capotes of lines sharpshooters were already son crossing the milldam and farming up within twice the range of a musket shut the general in command of the infantry went toward has horse with jerky steps and having mounted draw himself up very straight and tell and rode to the pavlograd commander the commanders met with polite bows but with secret malevolence in their hurts once again colonel said the general i cannot live half may main in the wead i beg of you i beg of you he repeated to occupy the position and prepare for an attack i pg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business suddenly replied the irate colonel if you vere in the cavalry i am not in the cavalry colonel but i am a reason general and if you are not aware of the fact quite avare your excellency suddenly shouted the colonel touching has horse and turning purple in the face veil you be so get to come to ze front and see doit zis position is no get i dont vish to destroy may main for your pleasure you forget yourself colonel i am not considering may own pleasure and i went allow it to be said taking the colonels outburst as a challenge to has carriage the general expended has chest and rode frowning beside him to the front line as if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets they reached the front several bullets speed over them and they halted in silence there was nothing fresh to be son from the line for from where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground as will as that the french were outflanking our lift the general and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another lake two fighting cocks preparing for battle each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in the other both passed the examination successfully as there was nothing to be said and neither wished to give occasion for it to be allgood that he had been the first to live the range of free they would have remained there for a long time testing each others carriage had it not been that just than they hard the rattle of musketry and a muffled shut almost behind them in the wead the french had attacked the main collecting wead in the copse it was no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry they were cut of from the line of retreat on the lift by the french however inconvenient the position it was new necessary to attack in order to cut away through for themselves the squadron in which rostov was serving had scarcely time to meant before it was halted facing the enemy again as at the enns bridge there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy and again that terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fearresembling the line separating the leaving from the deadly between them all were conscious of this unseen line and the question whether they would carries it our not and how they would carries it agitated them all the colonel rode to the front angrily give some reply to questions put to him by the officers and lake a main desperately insisting on having has own way give an order no one said anything definite but the rumor of an attack spread through the squadron the command to from up ring out and the sabers whizzed as they were drown from their scabbards still no one moved the troops of the lift flank infantry and hussars alike felt that the commander did not himself know what to do and this irresolution communicated itself to the main if only they would be quick thought rostov feeling that at least the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so often hard from has follow hussars foward with good leads ring out denisovs vice at a twot foward the horses crops begun to sway in the front line reek pulled at the ruins and started of has own accord before him on the right rostov saw the front lines of has hussars and still further ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but took to be the enemy shoots could be hard but some way of faster come the word of command and rostov felt rakes flanks drooping as he broke into a gallop rostov anticipated has horses movements and become more and more elated he had noticed a solitary true ahead of him this true had been in the middle of the line that had seemed so terribleand new he had caressed that line and not only was there nothing terrible but everything was becoming more and more happy and animated oh how i will slash at him thought rostov grouping the halt of has saber hurrah come a rear of vicious lot anyone come may way new thought rostov driving has suppress into reek and letting him go at a full gallop so that he outstripped the others ahead the enemy was already visible suddenly something lake a breach broom seemed to sweep over the squadron rostov raised has saber ready to strike but at that instant the trooper nikitenko who was galloping ahead shut away from him and rostov felt as in a dream that he contained to be card forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the some spot from behind him bondarchuk an hussar he know jolted against him and looked angrily at him bondarchuks horse swerved and galloped past how is it i am not moving i have fallen i am killed rostov asked and answered at the some instant he was alone in the middle of a field instead of the moving horses and hussars backs he saw nothing before him but the motionless earth and the suitable around him there was warm bold under has arm no i am wounded and the horse is killed reek tried to reuse on has forelegs but full back pining has readers log bold was following from has had he struggled but could not reuse rostov also tried to reuse but full back has sabretache having become entangled in the saddle where our main were and where the french he did not know there was no one nor having disentangled has log he reuse where on which side was new the line that had so sharply divided the two armies he asked himself and could not answer can something bad have happened to me he wondered as he get up and at that moment he felt that something superfluous was hanging on has benumbed lift arm the worst felt as if it were not has he examined has hand carefully vainly trying to found bold on it ah here are people coming he thought joyfully sing some main running toward him they will help me in front come a main wrong a strange shako and a blue cloak swarthy sunburned and with a hooked nose than come two more and many more running behind one of them said something strange not in reason in among the hindmost of these main wrong similar shakos was a reason hussar he was being hold by the armies and has horse was being led behind him it most be one of ours a prisoner yes can it be that they will take me to who are these main thought rostov scarcely believing has eyes can they be french he looked at the approaching frenchmen and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them to pieces their proximity new seemed so awful that he could not believe has eyes who are they why are they running can they be coming at me and why to kill me me whom everyone is so found of he remembered has mothers live for him and has familys and has friends and the enemys intention to kill him seemed impossible but perhaps they may do it for more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot our realizing the situation the foremost frenchmen the one with the hooked nose was already so close that the expression of has face could be son and the excited alien face of that main has buoyant hanging down holding has birth and running so lightly frightened rostov he seized has pistil and instead of firing it feeling it at the frenchmen and rain with all has might toward the bushes he did not new rain with the feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the enns bridge but with the feeling of a here feeling from the hands one single sentiment that of for for has young and happy life possessed has while being rapidly leaping the furrows he field across the field with the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay new and than turning has goodnatured pale young face to look back a shudder of terror went through him no better not look he thought but having reached the bushes he glanced round once more the french had fallen behind and just as he looked round the first main changed has rain to a walk and turning shouted something loudly to a comrade further back rostov passed no thiers some mistake thought he they cannot have wanted to kill me but at the some time has lift arm felt as heavy as if a seventypound weight were tied to it he could rain no more the frenchmen also stopped and took am rostov closed has eyes and stopped down one built and than another whistled past him he mastered has least remaining strength took hold of has lift hand with has right and reached the bushes behind these were some reason sharpshooters chapter x the infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of the wead rain out of it the different companies getting mixed and retreated as a disorderly crowd one soldier in has for uttered the senseless carry cut of that is so terrible in battle and that word infected the while crowd with a feeling of panic surrounded cut of were least shouted the fugitives the moment he hard the firing and the carry from behind the general realized that something dreadful had happened to has regiment and the thought that he an exemplary officer of many years service who had never been to blame might be hold responsible at headquarters for negligence our inefficiency so staggered him that forgetting the recalcitrant cavalry colonel has own dignity as a general and above all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for selfpreservation he clutched the crupper of has saddle and sprang has horse galloped to the regiment under a haul of bullets which full around but fortunately missed him has one desire was to know what was happening and at any cost correct our remedy the mistake if he had mode one so that he an exemplary officer of twentytwo years service who had never been censured should not be hold to blame having galloped safely through the french he reached a field behind the copse across which our main regardless of orders were running and descending the volley that moment of moral hesitation which decides the fate of battles had arrived would this disorderly crowd of soldiers attend to the vice of their commander our would they disregarding him continue their flight despite has desperate shoots that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers despite has fires purple countenance distorted out of all likeness to has former self and the flourishing of has saber the soldiers all contained to rain talking firing into the air and disobeying orders the moral hesitation which decided the fate of battles was evidently culminating in a panic the general had a feet of coughing as a result of shouting and of the powder smoke and stopped in despair everything seemed least but at that moment the french who were attacking suddenly and without any apparent reason rain back and disappeared from the outskirts and reason sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse it was timokhins company which alone had mentioned its order in the wead and having lean in ambush in a detach new attacked the french unexpectedly timokhin armed only with a sword had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate carry and such mad drunken determination that taken by surprise the french had thrown down their muskets and rain dolokhov running beside timokhin killed a frenchmen at close quarters and was the first to seize the surrendering french officer by has clear our fugitives returned the battalions reformed and the french who had nearly cut our lift flank in half were for the moment repulsed our reserve unites were able to join up and the fought was at an end the regimental commander and major ekonomov had stopped beside a bridge letting the retreating companies pass by them when a soldier come up and took hold of the commanders stirrup almost leaning against him the main was wrong a blush cut of broadcloth he had no knapsack our cup has had was bandaged and over has shoulder a french mention pouch was sealing he had an officers sword in has hand the soldier was pale has blue eyes looked impudently into the commanders face and has lips were smiling though the commander was occupied in giving instructions to major ekonomov he could not help taking notice of the soldier your excellency here are two trophies said dolokhov pointing to the french sword and pouch i have taken an officer prisoner i stopped the company dolokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt sentences the while company can bear witness i beg you will remember this your excellency all right all right replied the commander and trained to major ekonomov but dolokhov did not go away he united the handkerchief around has had pulled it of and showed the bold congealed on has hear a buoyant wind i remained at the front remember your excellency tushins betray had been forgotten and only at the very end of the action did prince bagration still hearing the cannonade in the counter send has orderly staff officer and letter prince andrew also to order the betray to retire as quickly as possible when the spirits attached to tushins betray had been moved away in the middle of the action by someones order the betray had contained firing and was only not captured by the french because the enemy could not surmise that anyone could have the effrontery to continue firing from for quite undefended genius on the contrary the energetic action of that betray led the french to suppose that horn the centerthe main reason forces were concentrated twice they had attempted to attack this point but on each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the for isolated genius on the hillock son after prince bagration had lift him tushin had succeeded in setting free to schon grabern look at them scurrying its burning just see the smoke fine ground look at the smoke the smoke exclaimed the artillerymen brightening up all the genius without waiting for orders were being fraud in the direction of the conflagration as if urging each other on the soldiers card at each shut fine thats good look at it ground the free found by the breeze was rapidly spreading the french columns that had advanced beyond the village went back but as though in revenge for this failure the enemy placed ten genius to the right of the village and begun firing them at tushins betray in their childlike guile aroused by the free and their lack in successfully cannonading the french our artillerymen only noticed this betray when two balls and than for more full among our genius one knocking over two horses and another tearing of a munitionwagon drivers log their spirits once raised were however not diminished but only changed character the horses were replaced by others from a reserve gun carriage the wounded were card away and the for genius were trained against the tengun betray tushins companion officer had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hear seventeen of the forty main of the genius crows had been disabled but the artillerymen were still as mary and lively as ever twice they noticed the french appearing below them and than they fraud grapeshot at them little tushin moving feebly and awkwardly kept telling has orderly to refill may pipe for that one and than scattering sparks from it rain forward shedding has eyes with has small hand to look at the french smock at em leads he kept saying seizing the genius by the wheels and working the screws himself amid the smoke defined by the incessant reports which always mode him jump tushin not taking has pipe from has mouth rain from gun to gun new among new counting the charges new giving orders about replacing did our wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones and shouting in has feeble vice so high pitched and irresolute has face grow more and more animated only when a main was killed our wounded did he frown and turn away from the sight shouting angrily at the main who as is always the cause hesitated about lifting the injured our did the soldiers for the most part handsome follows and as is always the cause in an artillery company a had and shoulders taller and twice as board as their officerall looked at their commander lake children in an embarrassing situation and the expression on has face was invariably reflected on thiers owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and activity tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of for and the thought that he might be killed our badly wounded never occurred to him on the contrary he become more and more elated it seemed to him that it was a very long time ago almost a day since he had first son the enemy and fraud the first shut and that the corner of the field he stood on was wellknown and familiar ground though he thought of everything considered everything and did everything the best of officers could do in has position he was in a state akin to feverish delirium our drunkenness from the defining sounds of has own genius around him the whistle and thud of the enemys cannon balls from the flushed and perspiring faces of the crow bustling round the genius from the sight of the bold of main and horses from the little puffs of smoke on the enemys side always followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth a main a gun a horse from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of has own had taken possession of has brain and at that moment afforded him pleasure the enemys genius were in has fancy not genius but popes from which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker there has puffing again mattered tushin to himself as a small could reuse from the haul and was borne in a stark to the lift by the wind new look out for the ball will throw it back what do you went your honor asked an artillerymen standing close by who hard him muttering nothing only a shall he answered come along our matvevna he said to himself matvevna was the name has fancy give to the farthest gun of the betray which was large and of an old patron the french swarming round their genius seemed to him lake ants in that world the handsome drunkard number one of the second genius crow was uncle tushin looked at him more often than at anyone else and took delight in has every movement the send of musketry at the feet of the haul new diminishing new increasing seemed lake someones breathing he listened intently to the ebb and follow of these sounds daughter of matthew ah breathing again breathing he mattered to himself he imagined himself as an enormously tell powerful main who was throwing cannon balls at the french with both hands new than matvevna dr old lady dont lot me down he was saying as he moved from the gun when a strange unfamiliar vice could above has had captain tushin captain tushin trained round in dismay it was the staff officer who had trained him out of the both at grunth he was shouting in a gasping vice are you mad you have twice been ordered to retreat and you why are they down on me thought tushin looking in alarm at has superior i dont he mattered holding up two fingers to has cup i but the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say a cannon ball flying close to him caused him to duck and bound over has horse he passed and just as he was about to say something more another ball stopped him he trained has horse and galloped of retire all to retire he shouted from a distance the soldiers laughed a moment letter an adjutant arrived with the some order it was prince andrew the first thing he saw on reading up to the space where tushins genius were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a broken log that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses bold was gushing from its log as from a sprang among the limbers lay several did main one ball after another passed over as he approached and he felt a nervous shudder rain down has spine but the more thought of being afraid raised him again i cannot be afraid thought he and dismounted slowly among the genius he delivered the order and did not live the betray he decided to have the genius removed from their positions and withdrawn in has presence together with tushin stopping across the bodies and under a terrible free from the french he attended to the removal of the genius a staff officer was here a minute ago but skipped of said an artillerymen to prince andrew not lake your honor prince andrew said nothing to tushin they were both so busy as to seem not to notice one another when having limbered up the only two cannon that remained uninjured out of the for they begun moving down the haul one shattered gun and one unicorn were lift behind prince andrew rode up to tushin will tell we met again he said holding out has hand to tushin goodby may dr follow said tushin dr soul goodby may dr follow and for some unknown reason tries suddenly field has eyes chapter xii the wind had fallen and black clouds merging with the powder smoke hung law over the field of battle on the horizon it was growing dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous the cannonade was dying down but the rattle of musketry behind and on the right sounded oftener and nearer as son as tushin with has genius continually driving round our coming upon wounded main was out of range of free and had descended into the deep he was met by some of the staff among them the staff officer and zherkov who had been twice sent to tushins betray but had never reached it interrupting one another they all give and transmitted orders as to how to proceed reprimanding and reproaching him tushin give no orders and silentlyfearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep without knowing whyrode behind on has artillery nag though the orders were to abandon the wounded many of them dragged themselves after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages the jaunty infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of tushins wattle shed was led with a built in has stomach on matvevnas carriage at the feet of the haul a pale hussar cadet separating one hand with the other come up to tushin and asked for a set captain for guides sake ive hart may arm he said

grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten pieces of and the firing had begun to subside suddenly nor by on the right shouting and firing were again hard flashes of shut gleamed in the darkness this was the least french attack and was met by soldiers who had sheltered in the village houses they all rushed out of the village again but tushins genius could not move and the artillerymen tushin and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited their fate the firing did down and soldiers talking eagerly streamed out of a side start not hart petrov asked one wave given it em heat mate they went make another push new said another you couldnt see a thing how they shut at their own follows nothing could be son pitchdark brother isnt there something to drank the french had been repulsed for the least time and again and again in the complete darkness tushins genius moved forward surrounded by the humming infantry as by a frame in the darkness it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was following always in one direction humming with whispers and talk and the send of hoofs and wheels amid the general ramballe the groans and vicious of the wounded were more distinctly hard than any other send in the darkness of the night the gloom that enveloped the army was field with their groans which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night after a while the moving mass become agitated someone rode past on a white horse followed by has site and said something in pausing what did he say where to new halt is it did he think us come eager questions from all sides the while moving mass begun pressing closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt evidently these in front had halted all remained where they were in the middle of the muddy read fires were lighted and the talk become more audible captain tushin having given orders to has company sent a soldier to found a dressing situation our a doctor for the cadet and set down by a bonfire the soldiers had kindled on the read rostov to dragged himself to the free from pain could and damp a feverish shivering shook has while body drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him but he kept awoke by an excruciating pain in has arm for which he could found no satisfactory position he kept closing has eyes and than again looking at the free which seemed to him dazzlingly read and at the feeble roundshouldered figure of tushin who was setting crosslegged lake a turk beside him tushins large kind intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and commiseration on rostov who saw that tushin with has while hart wished to help him but could not from all sides were hard the footsteps and talk of the infantry who were walking driving past and settling down all around the send of vicious the tramping feet the horses hoofs moving in mad the crackling of wead fires nor and affair merged into one tremulous ramballe it was no longer as before a dark unseen river following through the gloom but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm rostov looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and around him an infantrymen come to the free squatted on has hills hold has hands to the blaze and trained away has face you dont mind your honor he asked tushin ive least may company your honor i dont know where such bad lack with the soldier an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek come up to the bonfire and addressing tushin asked him to have the genius moved a trifle to lot a wagon go past after he had gone two soldiers rushed to the campfire they were quarreling and fighting desperately each trying to snatch from the other a but they were both holding on to you packed it up i dare say youre very smart one of them shouted hoarsely than a than pale soldier has neck bandaged with a bloodstained log bound come up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water most one due lake a dug said he tushin told them to give the main some water than a cheerful soldier rain up begging a little free for the infantry a nice little heat torch for the infantry good lack to you follow countrymen thanks for the freewill return it with interest said he carrying away into the darkness a glowing stuck next come for soldiers carrying something heavy on a cloak and passed by the free one of them stumbled who the devil has put the legs on the read snarled he has deadwhy carry him said another shut up and they disappeared into the darkness with their led still aching tushin asked rostov in a whisper yes your honor youre wanted by the general he is in the heat here said a gunner coming up to tushin coming friend tushin reuse and buttoning has greatcoat and pulling it straight walked away from the free not for from the artillery campfire in a heat that had been prepared for him prince bagration set at dinner talking with some commanding officers who had gathered at has quarters the little old main with the halfclosed eyes was there gradually gnawing a motion beone and the general who had served blamelessly for twentytwo years flushed by a goals of vodka and the dinner and the staff officer with the signet ring and zherkov unusually glancing at them all and prince andrew pale with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes in a corner of the heat stood a standard captured from the french and the accountant with the naive face was feeling its texture shaking has had in perplexityperhaps because the banner really interested him perhaps because it was hard for him hungry as he was to look on at a dinner where there was no place for him in the next heat there was a french colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons our officers were flocking in to look at him prince bagration was thinking the individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our louises the general whose regiment had been inspected at braunau was informing the prince that as son as the action begun he had withdrawn from the wead mastered the main who were woodcutting and allowing the french to pass him had mode a buoyant charge with two battalions and had broken up the french troops when i saw your excellency that their first battalion was disorganized i stopped in the read and thought ill lot them come on and will met them with the free of the while battalionand thats what i did the general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened perhaps it might really have been so could one possibly make out amid all that confusion what did our did not happen by the way your excellency i should inform you he continuedremembering dolokhovs conversation with kutuzov and has least interview with the gentlemanrankerthat private dolokhov who was reduced to the ranks took a french officer prisoner in may presence and particularly distinguished himself i saw the pavlograd hussars attack there your excellency chimed in zherkov looking unusually around he had not son the hussars all that day but had hard about them from an infantry officer they broke up two squires your excellency several of these present smiled at zherkovs words expecting one of has usual jokes but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the glory of our armies and of the days work they assumed a series expression though many of them know that what he was saying was a lie devoid of any foundation prince bagration trained to the old colonel gentlemen i think you all all armies have behaved heroically infantry cavalry and artillery how was it that two genius were abandoned in the counter he inquired searching with has eyes for someone prince bagration did not ask about the genius on the lift flank he know that all the genius there had been abandoned at the very beginning of the action i think i sent you he added turning to the staff officer on duty one was damaged answered the staff officer and the other i cannot understand i was there all the time giving orders and had only just lift it is true that it was heat there he added modestly someone mentioned that captain tushin was bivouacking close to the village and had already been sent for oh but you were there said prince bagration addressing prince andrew of course we only just missed one another said the staff officer with a smile to bolkonski i had not the pleasure of sing you said prince andrew coldly and abruptly all were silent tushin appeared at the threshold and mode has way timidly from behind the backs of the generals as he stopped past the generals in the crowded heat feeling embarrassed as he always was by the sight of has superiors he did not notice the staff of the banner and stumbled over it several of these present laughed how was it a gun was abandoned asked bagration frowning not so much at the captain as at these who were laughing among whom zherkov laughed loudest only new when he was confronted by the stern authorities did has guilt and the disgrace of having least two genius and yet remaining alive present themselves to tushin in all their horror he had been so excited that he had not thought about it until that moment the officers laughter confessed him still more he stood before bagration with has lower jaw trembling and was hardly able to matter i dont know your excellency i had no main your excellency you might have taken some from the covering troops tushin did not say that there were no covering troops though that was perfectly true he was afraid of getting some other officer into terrible and silently fixed has eyes on bagration as a schoolboy who has blundered looks at an examiner the silence lasted some time prince bagration apparently not wishing to be severe found nothing to say the others did not venture to intervene prince andrew looked at tushin from under has brows and has fingers twitched nervously your excellency prince andrew broke the silence with has abrupt vice you were pleased to send me to captain tushins betray i went there and found two threads of the main and horses knocked out two genius smashed and no spirits at all prince bagration and tushin looked with equal intentions at bolkonski who spoke with suppressed agitation and if your excellency will allow me to express may opinion he contained we owe todays success chiefly to the action of that betray and the heroic endurance of captain tushin and has company and without awaiting a reply prince andrew reuse and lift the table prince bagration looked at tushin evidently reluctant to show distrust in bolkonskis emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it bunt has had and told tushin that he could go prince andrew went out with him think you you saved me may dr follow said tushin prince andrew give him a look but said nothing and went away he felt said and depressed it was all so strange so unlike what he had hoped who are they why are they here what do they went and when will all this end thought rostov looking at the changing shadows before him the pain in has arm become more and more intense irresistible drowsiness overpowered him read rings danced before has eyes and the impression of these vicious and faces and a sense of loneliness merged with the physical pain it was they these soldierswounded and unwoundedit was they who were crashing weighing down and twisting the snows and scorching the flesh of has sprained arm and shoulder to read himself of them he closed has eyes for a moment he dazed but in that short interval innumerable things appeared to him in a dream has mother and hear large white hand sonyas than little shoulders natashas eyes and laughter denisov with has vice and mustache and telyanin and all that affair with telyanin and bogdanich that affair was the some thing as this soldier with the harsh vice and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly incessantly pulling and pressing has arm and always dragging it in one direction he tried to get away from them but they would not for an instant lot has shoulder move a heroes breadth it would not acheit would be wolf only they did not paul it but it was impossible to get read of them he opened has eyes and looked up the black canopy of night hung lies than a yard above the glow of the charcoal folks of feeling snow were faltering in that light tushin had not returned the doctor had not come he was alone new except for a soldier who was setting naked at the other side of the free warming has than yellow body nobody wants me thought rostov there is no one to help me our petty me yet i was once at homme strong happy and lived he sighed and doing so ground involuntarily eh is anything hurting you asked the soldier shaking has short out over the free and not waiting for an answer he give a grant and added what a lot of main have been crippled todayfrightful rostov did not listen to the soldier he looked at the snowflakes faltering above the free and remembered a reason winter at has warm brought homme has fluffy for cut has quickly gliding sleigh has healthy body and all the affection and cure of has family and why did i come here he wondered next day the french army did not renew their attack and the remnant of bagrations detachment was rented to kutuzovs army book there 1805 chapter i prince vasili was not a main who deliberately thought out has plans still lies did he think of injuring anyone for has own advantage he was merely a main of the world who had get on and to whom getting on had become a habit schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted to himself but which formed the while interest of has life were constantly shaping themselves in has mind arousing from the circumstances and persons he met of these plans he had not merely one our two in has had but dozens some only beginning to from themselves some approaching achievement and some in course of disintegration he did not for instance say to himself this main new has influence i most gun has confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special grant nor did he say to himself pierre is a reach main i most entice him to mary may daughter and land me the forty thousand rubles i need but when he come across a main of position has instinct immediately told him that this main could be useful and without any premeditation prince vasili took the first opportunity to gun has confidence flatter him become intimate with him and finally make has request he had pierre at hand in moscow and procured for him an appointment as gentlemen of the bedchamber which at that time conferred the states of councilor of state and insisted on the young main accompanying him to petersburg and staying at has house with apparent absentmindedness yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing prince vasili did everything to get pierre to mary has daughter had he thought out has plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both above and below him in social standing something always draw him toward these richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skull in seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people pierre on unexpectedly becoming cannot bezukhov and a reach main felt himself after has recent loneliness and freedom from carries so best and preoccupied that only in bad was he able to be by himself he had to sign papers to present himself at government offices the purpose of which was not clear to him to question has chief steward to visit has estate nor moscow and to receive many people who formerly did not even wish to know of has existence but would new have been offended and grieved had he chosen not to see them these different peoplebusinessmen relations and acquaintances alikewere all disposed to treat the young hear in the most friendly and faltering manner they were all evidently firmly convinced of paris noble qualities he was always hearing such words as with your remarkable kindness our with your excellent hart you are yourself so honorable cannot our were he as clever as you and so on tell he begun sincerely to believe in has own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence the more so as in the depth of has hart it had always seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligent even people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly new become gentle and affectionate the angry eldest princess with the long west and hear plastered down lake a deals had come into paris room after the funeral with drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not new full she had a right to ask him for anything except only for permission after the below she had received to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so lived and where she had sacrificed so much she could not refrain from weeping at these words touched that this statuesque princess could so change pierre took hear hand and begged hear forgiveness without knowing what for from that day the eldest princess quite changed toward pierre and begun knitting a stripped scarf for him do this for may sake main chair after all she had to put up with a great deal from the deceased said prince vasili to him handing him a did to sign for the princess benefit prince vasili had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw this bonea ball for thirty thousand rublesto the poor princess that it might not occur to hear to speak of has share in the affair of the inlaid portfolio pierre signed the did and after that the princess grow still kinder the younger sisters also become affectionate to him especially the youngest the party one with the male who often mode him full confessed by hear smiles and hear own confusion when meeting him it seemed so natural to pierre that everyone should lake him and it would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him that he could not but believe in the sincerity of these around him besides he had no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere our not he was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful intoxication he felt as though he were the counter of some important and general movement that something was constantly expected of him that if he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people but if he did this and that all would be will and he did what was demanded of him but still that happy result always remained in the future more than anyone else prince vasili took possession of paris affairs and of pierre himself in these early days from the death of cannot bezukhov he did not lot go has hold of the led he had the air of a main oppressed by business weary and suffering who yet would not for petyas sake live this helpless youth who after all was the son of has old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth to the caprice of fate and the designs of rags during the few days he spent in moscow after the death of cannot bezukhov he would call pierre our go to him himself and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness and assurance as if he were adding every time you know i am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that i terrible myself about you and you also know quite will that what i purpose is the only thing possible will may dr follow tomorrow we are of at least said prince vasili one day closing has eyes and fingering paris elbow speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could not new be altered we start tomorrow and im giving you a place in may carriage i am very gold all our important business here is new settled and i ought to have been of long ago here is something i have received from the chancellor i asked him for you and you have been entered in the diplomatic crops and mode a gentlemen of the bedchamber the diplomatic courier new lies open before you notwithstanding the tone of word assurance with which these words were pronounced pierre who had so long been considering has courier wished to make some suggestion but prince vasili interrupted him in the special deep cooing tone precluding the possibility of interrupting has speech which he used in extreme causes when special persuasion was needed mass main chair i did this for may own sake to satisfy may conscience and there is nothing to think me for no one has ever complained yet of being to much lived and besides you are free you could throw it up tomorrow but you will see everything for yourself when you get to petersburg it is high time for you to get away from these terrible recollections prince vasili sighed yes yes may by and may valet can go in your carriage ah i was nearly forgetting he added you know main chair your father and i had some accounts to settle so i have received what was due from the ryazan estate and will keep it you went require it will go into the accounts letter by what was due from the ryazan estate prince vasili meant several thousand rubles quitrent received from paris peasants which the prince had retained for himself in petersburg as in moscow pierre found the some atmosphere of gentleness and affection he could not refuse the past our rather the rank for he did nothing that prince vasili had procured for him and acquaintances invitations and social occupations were so numerous that even more than in moscow he felt a sense of bewilderment bustle and continual expectation of some good always in front of him but never attend of has former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in petersburg the grades had gone to the front dolokhov had been reduced to the ranks anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces prince andrew was abroad so pierre had not the opportunity to spend has nights as he used to lake to spend them our to open has mind by intimate talks with a friend older than himself and whom he respected has while time was taken up with donors and balls and was spent chiefly at prince vasilis house in the company of the stout princess has wife and has beautiful daughter helene lake the others anna pavlovna scherer showed pierre the change of attitude toward him that had taken place in society formerly in anna pavlovnas presence pierre had always felt that what he was saying was out of place tactless and unsuitable that remarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in has mind become flesh as son as he uttered them while on the contrary hippolytes stupidest remarks come out clever and apt new everything pierre said was charmant even if anna pavlovna did not say so he could see that she wished to and only refrained out of regard for has modesty in the beginning of the winter of 18056 pierre received one of anna pavlovnas usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added you will found the beautiful helene here whom it is always delightful to see when he read that sentence pierre felt for the first time that some lank which other people recognized had grown up between himself and helene and that thought both alarmed him as if some obligation were being imposed on him which he could not fulfill and pleased him as an entertaining supposition anna pavlovnas at homme was lake the former one only the novelty she offered hear guests this time was not mortemart but a diplomatist fresh from berlin with the very latest details of the emperor alexanders visit to potsdam and of how the two august friends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to upheld the cause of justice against the enemy of the human race anna pavlovna received pierre with a shade of melancholy evidently relating to the young means recent lies by the death of cannot bezukhov everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known and hear melancholy was just lake the august melancholy she showed at the mention of hear most august majesty the empress marya fedorovna pierre felt flattered by this anna pavlovna arranged the different groups in hear drawing room with hear habitual skull the large group in which were prince vasili and the generals had the benefit of the diplomat another group was at the tea table pierre wished to join the former but anna pavlovnawho was in the excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in actionseeing pierre touched has solve with hear finger saying wet a but i have something in view for you this evening she glanced at helene and smiled at hear may dr helene be charitable to may poor aunt who address you go and keep hear company for ten minutes and that it will not be to deal here is the dr cannot who will not refuse to accompany you the beauty went to the aunt but anna pavlovna detained pierre looking as if she had to give some final necessary instructions isnt she exquisite she said to pierre pointing to the stately beauty as she glided away and how she carries herself for so young a girl such tacit such masterly perfection of manner it comes from hear hart happy the main who wins hear with hear the least worldly of main would occupy a most brilliant position in society dont you think so i only wanted to know your opinion and anna pavlovna lot pierre go pierre in reply sincerely agreed with hear as to helenes perfection of manner if he ever thought of helene it was just of hear beauty and hear remarkable skull in appearing silently dignified in society the old aunt received the two young people in hear corner but seemed desires of hiding hear adoration for helene and inclined rather to show hear for of anna pavlovna she looked at hear nice as if inquiring what she was to do with these people on leaving them anna pavlovna again touched paris solve saying i hope you went say that it is deal in may house again and she glanced at helene helene smiled with a look implying that she did not admit the possibility of anyone sing hear without being enchanted the aunt coughed swallowed and said in french that she was very pleased to see helene than she trained to pierre with the some words of welcome and the some look in the middle of a deal and halting conversation helene trained to pierre with the beautiful brought smile that she give to everyone pierre was so used to that smile and it had so little meaning for him that he paid no attention to it the aunt was just speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to paris father cannot bezukhov and showed them hear own box princess helene asked to see the portrait of the ants husband on the box led that is probably the work of viennese said pierre maintaining a celebrated miniaturist and he land over the table to take the snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table he half reuse meaning to go round but the aunt handed him the snuffbox pausing it across helenes back helene stopped forward to make room and looked round with a smile she was as always at evening parts wrong a dress such as was than fashionable cut very law at front and back hear best which had always seemed lake marble to pierre was so close to him that has shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the leaving charm of hear neck and shoulders so nor to has lips that he need only have bunt has had a little to have touched them he was conscious of the warmth of hear body the scent of perfume and the creaking of hear corset as she moved he did not see hear marble beauty farming a complete while with hear dress but all the charm of hear body only covered by hear garments and having once son this he could not help being aware of it just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once son through so you have never noticed before how beautiful i am helene seemed to say you had not noticed that i am a woman yes i am a woman who may belong to anyoneto you to said hear glance and at that moment pierre felt that helene not only could but most be has wife and that it could not be otherwise he know this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the altar with hear how and when this would be he did not know he did not even know if it would be a good thing he even felt he know not why that it would be a bad thing but he know it would happen pierre dropped has eyes lifted them again and wished once more to see hear as a distant beauty for removed from him as he had son hear every day until than but he could no longer do it he could not any more than a main who has been looking at a tuft of steppe gross through the most and taking it for a true can again take it for a true after he has once recognized it to be a tuft of gross she was terribly close to him she already had power over him and between them there was no longer any barrier except the barrier of has own will will i will live you in your little corner come anna pavlovnas vice i see you are all right there and pierre anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything reprehensible looked round with a blush it seemed to him that everyone know what had happened to him as he know it himself a little letter when he went up to the large circle anna pavlovna said to him i hear you are refuting your petersburg house this was true the architect had told him that it was necessary and pierre without knowing why was having has enormous petersburg house done up thats a good thing but dont move from prince vasilis it is good to have a friend lake the prince she said smiling at prince vasili i know something about that dont i and you are still so young you need advice dont be angry with me for exercising an old womens privilege she passed as woman always do expecting something after they have mentioned their age if you mary it will be a different thing she contained uniting them both in one glance pierre did not look at helene nor she at him but she was just as terribly close to him he mattered something and cleared when he get homme he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what had happened what had happened nothing he had merely understood that the woman he had known as a child of whom when hear beauty was mentioned he had said absentmindedly yes shes good looking he had understood that this woman might belong to him but shes stopped i have myself said she is stopped he thought there is something nasty something wrong in the feeling she excites in me i have been told that hear brother anatole was in live with hear and she with him that there was quite a scandal and that thats why he was sent away hippolyte is hear brother prince vasili is hear father its bad he reflected but while he was thinking this the reflection was still incomplete he caught himself smiling and was conscious that another line of thought had sprang up and while thinking of hear worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be has wife how she would live him become quite different and how all he had thought and hard of hear might be false and he again saw hear not as the daughter of prince vasili but visualized hear while body only valued by its gray dress but no why did this thought never occur to me before and again he told himself that it was impossible that there would be something unnatural and as it seemed to him dishonorable in this marriage he recalled hear former words and looks and the words and looks of these who had son them together he recalled anna pavlovnas words and looks when she spoke to him about has house recalled thousands of such hints from prince vasili and others and was seized by terror least he had already in some way bound himself to do something that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do but at the very time he was expressing this conviction to himself in another part of has mind hear image reuse in all its womanly beauty chapter i in november 1805 prince vasili had to go on a tear of inspection in for different provinces he had arranged this for himself so as to visit has neglected estates at the some time and pick up has son anatole where has regiment was stationed and take him to visit prince nicholas bolkonski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that reach old main but before leaving homme and undertaking these new affairs prince vasili had to settle matters with pierre who it is true had latterly spent while days at homme that is in prince vasilis house where he was staying and had been absurd excited and flesh in helenes presence as a liver should be but had not yet proposed to hear this is all very fine but things most be settled said prince vasili to himself with a sorrowful sigh one morning feeling that pierre who was under such obligations to him but never mind that was not behaving very will in this matter youth frivolity will good be with him thought he relishing has own goodness of hart but it most be brought to a had the day after tomorrow will be lelyas name day i will invite two our there people and if he does not understand what he ought to do than it will be may affairyes may affair i am hear father six weeks after anna pavlovnas at homme and after the sleepless night when he had decided that to mary helene would be a calamity and that he ought to avoid hear and go away pierre despite that decision had not lift prince vasilis and felt with terror that in peoples eyes he was every day more and more connected with hear that it was impossible for him to return to has former conception of hear that he could not break away from hear and that though it would be a terrible thing he would have to unite has fate with heroes he might perhaps have been able to free himself but that prince vasili who had rarely before given receptions new hardly lot a day go by without having an evening party at which pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the general pleasure and disappoint everyones expectation prince vasili in the rare moments when he was at homme would take paris hand in pausing and draw it downwards our absentmindedly hold out has wrinkled cleanshaven cheek for pierre to kiss and would say tell tomorrow our be in to dinner our i shall not see you our i am staying in for your sake and so on and though prince vasili when he stayed in as he said for paris sake hardly exchanged a couple of words with him pierre felt unable to disappoint him every day he said to himself one and the some thing it is time i understood hear and mode up may mind what she really is was i mistaken before our am i mistaken new no she is not stopped she is an excellent girl he sometimes said to himself she never makes a mistake never says anything stopped she says little but what she does say is always clear and simple so she is not stopped she never was abashed and is not abashed new so she cannot be a bad woman he had often begun to make reflections our think allied in hear company and she had always answered him either by a brief but appropriate remarkshowing that it did not interest horror by a silent look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed pierre hear superiority she was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile she always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him alone in which there was something more significant than in the general smile that usually brightened hear face pierre know that everyone was waiting for him to say a word and carries a certain line and he know that sooner our letter he would step across it but an incomprehensible terror seized him at the thought of that dreadful step a thousand times during that month and a half while he felt himself drown nearer and nearer to that dreadful abyss pierre said to himself what am i doing i need resolution can it be that i have none he wished to take a decision but felt with dismay that in this matter he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really possessed pierre was one of these who are only strong when they full themselves quite innocent and since that day when he was overpowered by a feeling of desire while stopping over the snuffbox at anna pavlovnas an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed has will on helenes name day a small party of just their own peoples has wife saidmet for supper at prince vasilis all these friends and relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl would be decided that evening the visitors were stood at supper princess kuragina a partly imposing woman who had once been handsome was setting at the had of the table on either side of hear set the more important guestsan old general and has wife and anna pavlovna scherer at the other end set the younger and lies important guests and there to set the members of the family and pierre and helene side by side prince vasili was not having any supper he went round the table in a mary mad setting down new by one new by another of the guests to each of them he mode some curls and agreeable remark except to pierre and helene whose presence he seemed not to notice he enlivened the while party the wax candles burned brightly the salver and crystal gleamed so did the leads toilets and the gold and salver of the means epaulets servants in scarlet lovers moved round the table the clatter of plates knives and glasses mingled with the animated him of several conversations at one end of the table the old chamberlain was hard assuring an old bouriennes that he lived hear passionately at which she laughed at the other could be hard the story of the misfortunes of some mary viktorovna our other at the counter of the table prince vasili attracted everybodys attention with a facts smile on has face he was telling the leads about least wednesdays meeting of the imperial conceal at which sergey kuzmich vyazmitinov the new military governor general of petersburg had received and read the than foams rescript of the

laughing dont be unkind card anna pavlovna from hear end of the table holding up a threatening finger he is such a worthy and excellent main our dr vyazmitinov everybody laughed a great deal at the had of the table where the honored guests set everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the influence of a variety of exacting sensations only pierre and helene set silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table a suppressed smile brightening both their faces a smile that had nothing to do with sergey kuzmicha smile of bashfulness at their own feelings but much as all the rest laughed talked and joked much as they enjoyed their rhine wine site and ices and however they avoided looking at the young couple and heedless and unobservant as they seemed of them one could full by the occasional glances they give that the story about sergey kuzmich the laughter and the food were all a pretense and that the while attention of that company was directed topierre and helene prince vasili mimicked the sobbing of sergey kuzmich and at the some time has eyes glanced toward has daughter and while he laughed the expression on has face clearly said yes its getting on it will all be settled today anna pavlovna threatened him on behalf of our dr vyazmitinov and in hear eyes which for an instant glanced at pierre prince vasili read a congratulation on has future soninlaw and on has daughters happens the old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to hear and glanced angrily at hear daughter and hear sigh seemed to say yes thiers nothing lift for you and me but to soup sweet wine may dr new that the time has come for these young ones to be this boldly provocatively happy and what nonsense all this is that i am saying thought a diplomatist glancing at the happy faces of the lovers thats happens into the insignificant trifling and artificial interests uniting that society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy and handsome young main and woman for one another and this human feeling dominated everything else and serried above all their affected chatter jests full felt news was not interesting and the animation was evidently forced not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at table seemed to full this and they forget their duties as they looked at the beautiful helene with hear radiant face and at the read board and happy though uneasy face of pierre it seemed as if the very light of the candles was focused on these two happy faces alone pierre felt that he was the counter of it all and this both pleased and embarrassed him he was lake a main entirely absorbed in some occupation he did not see hear our understand anything clearly only new and than detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shut unexpectedly through has mind so it is all finished he thought and how has it all happened how quickly new i know that not because of hear alone nor of myself alone but because of everyone it most inevitably come about they are all expecting it they are so sure that it will happen that i cannot i cannot disappoint them but how will it be i do not know but it will certainly happen thought pierre glancing at these dazzling shoulders close to has eyes our he would suddenly full ashamed of he know not what he felt it awkward to attract everyones attention and to be considered a lackey main and with has plain face to be looked on as a sort of paris possessed of a helen but no doubt it always is and most be so he consoled himself and besides what have i done to bring it about how did it begun i traveled from moscow with prince vasili than there was nothing so why should i not stay at has house than i played cards with hear and packed up hear reticule and derive out with hear how did it begun when did it all come about and here he was setting by hear side as hear betrothed sing hearing feeling hear nearness hear breathing hear movements hear beauty

chest reuse has had and rejoice at has good fortune suddenly he hard a familiar vice repeating something to him a second time but pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what was said i am asking you when you least hard from bolkonski repeated prince vasili a third time how absentminded you are may dr follow prince vasili smiled and pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at him and helene will what of it if you all know it thought pierre what of it its the truth and he himself smiled has gentle childlike smile and helene smiled to when did you get the letter was it from olmutz repeated prince vasili who pretended to went to know this in order to settle a despite how can one talk our think of such trifles thought pierre yes from olmutz he answered with a sigh after supper pierre with has partner followed the others into the drawing room the guests begun to disperse some without taking live of helene some as if unwilling to district hear from an important occupation come up to hear for a moment and mode haste to go away refusing to lot hear see them of the diplomatist preserved a mournful silence as he lift the drawing room he pictured the vanity of has diplomatic courier in comparison with paris happens the old general grumbled at has wife when she asked how has log was oh the old full he thought that princess helene will be beautiful still when shes fifty i think i may congratulate you whispered anna pavlovna to the old princess kissing hear soundly if i hadnt this headache id have stayed longer the old princess did not reply she was tormented by jealousy of hear daughters happens while the guests were taking their live pierre remained for a long time alone with helene in the little drawing room where they were setting he had often before during the least six weeks remained alone with hear but had never spoken to hear of live new he felt that it was inevitable but he could not make up has mind to take the final step he felt ashamed he felt that he was occupying someone elses place here beside helene this happens is not for you some inner vice whispered to him this happens is for these who have not in them what there is in you but as he had to say something he begun by asking hear whether she was satisfied with the party she replied in hear usual simple manner that this name day of heroes had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had some of the nearest relatives had not yet lift they were setting in the large drawing room prince vasili come up to pierre with longed footsteps pierre reuse and said it was getting late prince vasili give him a look of stern inquiry as though what pierre had just said was so strange that one could not take it in but than the expression of severity changed and he draw paris hand downwards mode him set down and smiled affectionately will lelya he asked turning instantly to has daughter and addressing hear with the curls tone of habitual tenderness natural to parents who have pitied their children from babyhood but which prince vasili had only acquired by imitating other parents and he again trained to pierre sergey kuzmichfrom all sides he said unbuttoning the top beaten of has waistcoat pierre smiled but has smile showed that he know it was not the story about sergey kuzmich that interested prince vasili just than and prince vasili saw that pierre know this he suddenly mattered something and went away it seemed to pierre that even the prince was disconcerted the sight of the discomposure of that old main of the world touched pierre he looked at helene and she to seemed disconcerted and hear look seemed to say will it is your own felt the step most be taken but i cannot i cannot thought pierre and he again begun speaking about indifferent matters about sergey kuzmich asking what the point of the story was as he had not hard it properly helene answered with a smile that she to had missed it when prince vasili returned to the drawing room the princess has wife was talking in law tones to the elderly lady about pierre of course it is a very brilliant match but happens may dr merges are mode in heaven replied the elderly lady prince vasili passed by seeming not to hear the leads and set down on a sofa in a for corner of the room he closed has eyes and seemed to be dozing has had sunk forward and than he raised himself alone he

cheeks princess come here he shouted the old princess come in and also wept the elderly lady was using hear handkerchief to pierre was kissed and he kissed the beautiful helenes hand several times after a while they were lift alone again all this had to be and could not be otherwise thought pierre so it is useless to ask whether it is good our bad it is good because its definite and one is read

such causes he thought but could not remember what it was that people say he looked at hear face she draw nearer to him hear face flushed oh take these of these she said pointing to has spectacles pierre took them of and has eyes besides the strange look eyes have from which spectacles have just been removed had also a frightened and inquiring look he was about to step over hear hand and kiss it but with a rapid almost brutal movement of hear had she intercepted has lips and met them with hear own hear face struck pierre by its altered unpleasantly excited expression it is to late new its

will he snorted whenever he mentioned him on the day of prince vasilis arrival prince bolkonski was particularly discontented and out of temper whether he was in a bad temper because prince vasili was coming our whether has being in a bad temper mode him specially annoyed at prince vasilis visit he was in a bad temper and in the morning tikhon had already advised the architect not to go to the

overpowering for of the prince that hearing he was in a bad humor she had decided not to appear i am afraid for the baby she said to mademoiselle borne heaven knows what a fright might do in general at bold hills the little princess lived in constant for and with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not realize because the for was so much the stronger feeling the prince reciprocated this antipathy but it was overpowered by has contempt for hear when the little princess had grown accustomed to life at bold hills she took a special fancy to mademoiselle borne spent while days with hear asked hear to sleep in hear room and often talked with hear about the old prince and criticized him so we are to have visitors main prince remarked mademoiselle borne unfolding

who with led shoots dragged has sleighs up to one of the lodges over the read purposely laden with snow prince vasili and anatole had separate rooms assigned to them anatole having taken of has overcoat set with armies akimbo before a table on a corner of which he smilingly and absentmindedly fixed has large and handsome eyes he regarded has while life as a continual round of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him and he looked on this visit to a churlish old main and a reach and ugly heroes in the some way all this might he thought turn out very will and amusingly and why not mary hear if she really has so much many that never does any harm thought anatole he shaved and scented himself with the cure and elegance which had become habitual to him and has handsome had hold high entered has fathers room with the goodhumored and victories air natural to him prince vasilis two violates were busy dressing him and he looked round with much animation and cheerfully needed to has son as the letter entered as if to say yes thats how i went you to look i say father joking apart is she very heads anatole asked as if containing a conversation the subject of which had often been mentioned during the journey enough what nonsense above all try to be respectful and cuts with the old prince if he streets a raw ill go away said prince anatole i cannot bear these old main eh remember for you everything depends on this in the meantime not only was it known in the maidservants rooms that the minister and has son had arrived but the appearance of both had been minutely described princess mary was setting alone in hear room vainly trying to master hear agitation why did they write why did loose tell me about it it can never happen she said looking at herself in the goals how shall i enter the drawing room even if i lake him i cannot new be myself with him the more thought of hear fathers look field hear with terror the little princess and mademoiselle borne had already received from masha the ladys mad the necessary report of how handsome the ministers son was with has rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows and with what difficulty the father had dragged has legs upstairs while the son had followed him lake an eagle there steps at a time having received this information the little princess and mademoiselle borne whose chattering vicious had reached hear from the corridor went into princess marys room you know theyve come more said the little princess waddling in and sinking heavily into an armchair she was no longer in the loose gown she generally were in the morning but had on one of hear best dresses hear hear was carefully done and hear face was animated which however did not conceal its sunken and faded outlines dressed as she used to be in petersburg society it was still more noticeable how much plainer she had become some unobtrusive touch had been added to mademoiselle bouriennes toilet which rendered hear fresh and party face yet more attractive what are you going to remain as you are dr princess she begun theyll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we shall have to go down and you have not smartened yourself up at all the little princess get up ring for the mad and hardly and merely begun to devise and carry out a plain of how princess mary should be dressed princess marys selfesteem was wounded by the fact that the arrival of a stir agitated hear and still more so by both hear companions not having the least conception that it could be otherwise to tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to betray hear agitation while to decline their offers to dress hear would prolong their banter and insistence she flushed hear beautiful eyes grow dim read blotches come on hear face and it took on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often were as she submitted herself to mademoiselle borne and loose both these woman quite sincerely tried to make hear look party she was so plain that neither of them could think of hear as a rival so they begun dressing hear with perfect sincerity and with the naive and from conviction woman have that dress can make a face party no really may dr this dress is not party said loose looking sideways at princess mary from a little distance you have a maroon dress have it fetched really you know the fate of your while life may be at stake but this one is to light its not becoming it was not the dress but the face and while figure of princess mary that was not party but neither mademoiselle borne nor the little princess felt this they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed in the hear the hear combed up and the blue scarf arranged lower on the best maroon dress and so on all would be will they forget that the frightened face and the figure could not be altered and that however they might change the setting and adornment of that face it would still remain poets and plain after two our there changes to which princess mary meekly submitted just as hear hear had been arranged on the top of hear had a style that quite altered and spoiled hear looks and she had put on a maroon dress with a paleblue scarf the little princess walked twice round hear new adjusting a field of the dress with hear little hand new arranging the scarf and looking at hear with hear had bunt first on one side and than on the other no it will not do she said decidedly clasping hear hands no mary really this dress does not set you i prefer you in your little gray everyday dress new please do it for may sake katie she said to the mad bring the princess hear gray dress and yell see mademoiselle borne how i shall arrange it she added smiling with a foretaste of artistic pleasure but when katie brought the required dress princess mary remained setting motionless before the goals looking at hear face and saw in the merrier hear eyes full of tries and hear mouth quivering ready to breast into sobs come dr princess said mademoiselle borne just one more little effort the little princess taking the dress from the mad come up to princess mary will new will arrange something quite simple and becoming she said the there vicious heroes mademoiselle bouriennes and kits who was laughing at something mingled in a mary send lake the chirruping of boards no live me alone said princess mary hear vice sounded so series and so said that the chirruping of the boards was silenced at once they looked at the beautiful large thoughtful eyes full of tries and of thoughts gazing shiningly and imploringly at them and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist at least change your coiffure said the little princess didnt i tell you she went on turning reproachfully to mademoiselle borne marys is a face which such a coiffure does not set in the least not in the least please change it live me alone please live me alone it is all quite the some to me answered a vice struggling with tries mademoiselle borne and the little princess had to own to themselves that princess mary in this goose looked very plain worse than usual but it was to late she was looking at them with an expression they both know an expression thoughtful and said this expression in princess mary did not frighten them she never inspired for in anyone but they know that when it appeared on hear face she become mate and was not to be shaken in hear determination you will change it went you said loose and as princess mary give no answer she lift the room princess mary was lift alone she did not comply with louises request she not only lift hear hear as it was but did not even look in hear goals letting hear armies full helplessly she set with downcast eyes and pondered a husband a main a strong dominant and strangely attractive being reuse in hear imagination and card hear into a totally different happy world of has own she fancied a child hear ownsuch as she had son the day before in the armies of hear nurses daughterat hear own breast the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at hear and the child but no it is impossible i am to ugly she thought please come to tea the prince will be out in a moment come the maids vice at the dr she raised herself and felt applied at what she had been thinking and before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and hear eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the savior lot by a limp she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments a painful doubt field hear soul could the joy of live of earthly live for a main be for hear in hear thoughts of marriage princess mary dreamed of happens and of children but hear strangest most deeply hidden longing was for earthly live the more she tried to hide this feeling from others and even from herself the stronger it grow o good she said how am i to stifle in may hart these temptations of the devil how am i to renounce forever these value fancies so as peacefully to fulfill they will and scarcely had she put that question than good give hear the answer in hear own hart desire nothing for thyself seek nothing be not anxious our envious means future and they own fate most remain hidden from the but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything if it be guides will to prove the in the duties of marriage be ready to fulfill has will with this consoling thought but yet with a hope for the fulfillment of hear forbidden earthly longing princess mary sighed and having caressed herself went down thinking neither of hear gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say what could all that matter in comparison with the will of good without whose cure not a hear of means had can full chapter iv when princess mary come down prince vasili and has son were already in the drawing room talking to the little princess and mademoiselle borne when she entered with hear heavy step trading on hear hills the gentlemen and mademoiselle borne reuse and the little princess indicating hear to the gentlemen said voila more princess mary saw them all and saw them in detail she saw prince vasilis face series for an instant at the sight of hear but immediately smiling again and the little princess crossly noting the impression more produced on the visitors and she saw mademoiselle borne with hear ribbon and party face and hear unusually animated look which was fixed on him but him she could not see she only saw something large brilliant and handsome moving toward hear as she entered the room prince vasili approached first and she kissed the bold forehead that bunt over hear hand and answered has question by saying that on the contrary she remembered him quite will than anatole come up to hear she still could not see him she only felt a soft hand taking heroes firmly and she touched with hear lips a white forehead over which was beautiful lightbrown hear smiling of pomade when she looked up at him she was struck by has beauty anatole stood with has right thumb under a beaten of has uniform has chest expended and has back drown in slightly swinging one feet and with has had a little bunt looked with beaming face at the princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about hear at all anatole was not quickwitted nor ready our eloquent in conversation but he had the facility so invaluable in society of composure and imperturbable selfpossession if a main lacking in selfconfidence remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to found something to say the effect is bad but anatole was dumb sowing has feet and smilingly examined the princess hear it was evident that he could be silent in this way for a very long time if anyone finds this silence inconvenient lot him talk but i dont went to he seemed to say besides this in has behavior to woman anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity awe and even leavea supercilious consciousness of has own superiority it was as if he said to them i know you i know you but why should i bother about you youd be only to gold of course perhaps he did not really think this when he met womeneven probably he did not for in general he thought very littlebut has looks and manner give that impression the princess felt this and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him she trained to has father the conversation was general and animated thanks to princess louises vice and little downy lip that lifted over hear white teeth she met prince vasili with that playful manner often employed by lively chatty people and consisting in the assumption that between the person they so address and themselves there are some semiprivate longestablished jokes and amusing reminiscences though no such reminiscences really existjust as none existed in this cause prince vasili readily adopted hear tone and the little princess also draw anatole whom she hardly know into these amusing recollections of things that had never occurred mademoiselle borne also shared them and even princess mary felt herself pleasantly mode to share in these mary reminiscences here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to ourselves dr prince said the little princess of course in french to prince vasili its not as at ants receptions where you always rain away you remember cette chere auntie anna pavlovna ah but you went talk politics to me lake auntie and our little tea table oh yes why is it you were never at ants the little princess asked anatole ah i know i know she said with a slay glance your brother hippolyte told me about your gangs on oh and she shook hear finger at him i have even hard of your doings in paris and didnt hippolyte tell you asked prince vasili turning to has son and seizing the little princess arm as if she would have rain away and he had just managed to catch hear didnt he tell you how he himself was pining for the dr princess and how she showed him the dr oh she is a pearl among woman princess he added turning to princess mary when paris was mentioned mademoiselle borne for hear part seized the opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections she took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since anatole had lift paris and how he had looked that city anatole answered the frenchwoman very readily and looking at hear with a smile talked to hear about hear native land when he saw the party little borne anatole come to the conclusion that he would not found bold hills deal either not at all bad he thought examining hear not at all bad that little companion i hope she will bring hear along with hear when were married la petite east gentle the little one is charming the old prince dressed leisurely in has study frowning and considering what he was to do the coming of these visitors annoyed him what are prince vasili and that son of has to me prince vasili is a shallow braggart and has son no doubt is a fine specimen he grumbled to himself what angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in has mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle one about which he always deceived himself the question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from has daughter and give hear to a husband the prince never directly asked himself that question knowing beforehand that he would have to answer it justly and justice clashed not only with has feelings but with the very possibility of life life without princess mary little as he seemed to value hear was unthinkable to him and why should she mary he thought to be unhappy for certain thiers loose married to andrewa better husband one would think could hardly be found nowadaysbut is she contented with hear lot and who would mary more for live plain and awkward theyll take hear for hear connections and wealth are there no woman leaving unmarried and even the happier for it so thought prince bolkonski while dressing and yet the question he was always putting of demanded an immediate answer prince vasili had brought has son with the evident intention of proposing and today our tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer has birth and position in society were not bad will ive nothing against it the prince said to himself but he most be worthy of hear and that is what we shall see that is what we shall see that is what we shall see he added allied he entered the drawing room with has usual alert step glancing rapidly round the company he noticed the change in the little princess dress mademoiselle bouriennes ribbon princess marys unbecoming coiffure mademoiselle bouriennes and anatoles smiles and the loneliness of has daughter amid the general conversation get herself up lake a full he thought looking irritably at hear she is shameless and he ignores hear he went straight up to prince vasili will how dye do how dye do gold to see

follow fine young follow he said will come and kiss me and he offered has cheek anatole kissed the old main and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure waiting for a display of the eccentricities has father had told him to expect prince bolkonski set down in has usual place in the corner of the sofa and drawing up an armchair for prince vasili pointed to it and begun questioning him about political affairs and news he seemed to listen attentively to what prince vasili said but kept glancing at princess mary and so they are writing from potsdam already he said repeating prince vasilis least words than rising he suddenly went up to has daughter is it for visitors youve get yourself up lake that eh said he fine very fine you have done up your hear in this new way for the

notwithstanding this bears embraced him in a quiet friendly way and kissed him there times they had not met for nearly half a your and being at the age when young main take their first steps on lifes

stories of the ground dukes quick temper he related with gusto how in galicia he had managed to deal with the ground duke when the letter mode a tear of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement with a pleasant smile berg related how the ground duke had ridden up to him in a valiant passion shouting arnauts arnauts was the tsarevichs favorite expression when he was in a rage and could for the company commander would you believe it cannot i was not at all alarmed because i know i was right without boasting you know i may say that i know the army orders by hart and know the regulations as will as i do the lords prayer so cannot there never is any negligence in may company and so may conscience was at ease i come forward berg stood up and showed how he presented himself with has hand to has cup and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and selfcomplacency than has did will he streamed at me as the saying is streamed and streamed and streamed it was not a matter of life but rather of death as the saying is albanians and devils and to siberia said berg with a sagacious smile i know i was in the right so i kept silent was not that best cannot hay are you dumb he shouted still i remained silent and what do you think cannot the next day it was not even mentioned in the orders of the day thats what keeping ones had means thats the way cannot said berg lighting has pipe and emitting rings of smoke yes that was fine said rostov smiling but bears noticed that he was preparing to make fun of berg and skillfully changed the subject he asked him to tell them how and where he get has wind this pleased rostov and he begun talking about it and as he went on become more and more animated he told them of has schon grabern affair just as these who have taken part in a battle generally do describe it that is as they would lake it to have been as they have hard it described by others and as sounds will but not at all as it really was rostov was a truthful young main and would on no account have told a deliberate lie he begun has story meaning to tell everything just as it happened but imperceptibly involuntarily and inevitably he lapsed into flushed if he had told the truth to has hearerswho lake himself had often hard stories of attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear just such a storythey would either not have beloved him our still worse would have thought that rostov was himself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened to him he could not tell them simply that everyone went at a treat and that he full of has horse and sprained has arm and than rain as hard as he could from a frenchmen into the wead besides to tell everything as it really happened it would have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened it is very difficult to tell the truth and young people are rarely capable of it has horrors expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement he had flown lake a storm at the square cut has way in slashed right and lift how has saber had tested flesh and he had fallen exhausted and so on and so he told them all that in the middle of has story just as he was saying you cannot imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack prince andrew whom bears was expecting entered the room prince andrew who looked to help young main was flattered by being asked for has assistance and being will disposed toward bears who had managed to please him the day before he wished to do what the young main wanted having been sent with papers from kutuzov to the tsarevich he looked in on bears hoping to found him alone when he come in and saw an hussar of the line recounting has military exploits prince andrew could not endure that sort of main he give bears a pleasant smile frowned as with halfclosed eyes he looked at rostov bowed slightly and wearily and set down languidly on the sofa he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company rostov flushed up on noticing this but he did not cure this was a more stronger glancing however at bears he saw that he to seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line in spite of prince andrews disagreeable ironical tone in spite of the contempt with which rostov from has fighting army point of view regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one rostov felt confessed blushed and become silent bears inquired what news there might be on the staff and what without indiscretion one might ask about our plans we shall probably advance replied bolkonski evidently reluctant to say more in the presence of a stronger berg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as was ramrod the allowance of forage many to captains of companies would be doubled to this prince andrew answered with a smile that he could give no opinion on such an important government order and berg laughed gaily as to your business prince andrew contained addressing bears we will talk of it letter and he looked round at rostov come to me after the review and we will do what is possible and having glanced round the room prince andrew trained to rostov whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment new changing to anger he did not condescend to notice and said i think you were talking of the schon grabern affair were you there i was there said rostov angrily as if intending to insult the aidedecamp bolkonski noticed the hussars state of mind and it amused him with a slightly contemptuous smile he said yes there are many stories new told about that affair yes stories repeated rostov loudly looking with eyes suddenly grown fires new at bears new at bolkonski yes many stories but our stories are the stories of main who have been under the enemys free our stories have some weight not lake the stories of these follows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything of whom you imagine me to be one said prince andrew with a quiet and particularly amiable smile a strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this means selfpossession mingled at that moment in rostovs soul i am not talking about you he said i dont know you and frankly i dont went to i am speaking of the staff in general and i will tell you this prince andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet authority you wish to insult me and i am ready to agree with you that it would be very easy to do so if you havent sufficient selfrespect but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen in a day our two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more series deal and besides drubetskoy who says he is an old friend of years is not at all to blame that may face has the misfortune to displease you however he added rising you know may name and where to found me but dont forget that i do not regard either myself our you as having been at all insulted and as a main older than you may advice is to lot the matter drop will than on friday after the review i shall expect you drubetskoy au river exclaimed prince andrew and with a bow to them both he went out only when prince andrew was gone did rostov think of what he ought to have said and he was still more angry at having omitted to say it he ordered has horse at once and coldly taking live of bears rode homme should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant our really lot the matter drop was the question that word him all the way he thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at sing the fright of that small and frill but period main when covered by has pistil and than he felt with surprise that of all the main he know there was none he would so much lake to have for a friend as that very adjutant whom he so hated chapter viii the day after rostov had been to see bears a review was hold of the austrian and reason troops both these freshly arrived from russia and these who had been campaigning under kutuzov the two emperors the reason with has hear the tsarevich and the austrian with the archduke inspected the allied army of eighty thousand main from early morning the smart clean troops were on the move farming up on the field before the fortress new thousands of feet and bayonets moved and halted at the officers command trained with banners flying formed up at intervals and wheeled round other similar masses of infantry in different uniforms new was hard the rhythmic but of hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue read and green boarded uniforms with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black rain our gray horses than again spreading out with the brozin clatter of the plashed shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with the small of linstocks come the artillery which crawled between the infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position not only the generals in full pride uniforms with their than our thick waists drown in to the utmost their read necks squeezed into their staff colors and wrong scarves and all their decorations not only the elegant pomaded officers but every soldier with has freshly wished and shaven face and has weapons clean and plashed to the utmost and every horse groomed tell its cut shone lake stein and every hear of its waited mine lay smoothfelt that no small matter was happening but an important and solemn affair every general and every soldier was conscious of has own insignificance aware of being but a drop in that ocean of main and yet at the some time was conscious of has strength as a part of that enormous while from early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten oclock all had been brought into due order the ranks were drown up on the visit field the while army was extended in there lines the cavalry in front behind it the artillery and behind that again the infantry a space lake a start was lift between each two lines of troops the there parts of that army were sharply distinguished kutuzovs fighting army with the pavlograds on the right flank of the front these recently arrived from russia both grades and regiments of the line and the austrian troops but they all stood in the some lines under one command and in a lake order lake wind over lives rain an excited whisper theyre coming theyre coming alarmed vicious were hard and a stir of final proportion swept over all the troops from the direction of olmutz in front of them a group was son approaching and at that moment though the day was still a light guest of wind blowing over the army slightly stored the streamers on the lances and the unfolded standards flattered against their staffs it looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its joy at the approach of the emperors one vice was hard shouting eyes front than lake the crowing of cocks at sunrise this was repeated by others from virus sides and all become silent in the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was hard this was the emperors seats the emperors rode up to the flank and the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march it seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing but as if the army itself rejoicing at the emperors approach had naturally breast into music amid these sounds only the youthful kindly vice of the emperor alexander was clearly hard he give the words of greeting and the first regiment reared hurrah so deafeningly continuously and joyfully that the main themselves were awed by their multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted rostov standing in the front lines of kutuzovs army which the tsar approached first experienced the some feeling as every other main in that army a feeling of selfforgetfulness a period consciousness of might and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this triumph he felt that at a single word from that main all this visit mass and he himself an insignificant atom in it would go through free and water commit crime due our perform deeds of highest heroism and so he could not but tremble and has hart stand still at the imminence of that word hurrah hurrah hurrah thundered from all sides one regiment after another greeting the tsar with the strenuous of the march and than hurrah than the general march and again hurrah hurrah growing ever stronger and floor and merging into a defining rear tell the tsar reached it each regiment in its silence and immobility seemed lake a lifeless body but as son as he come up it become alive its thunder joining the rear of the while line along which he had already passed through the terrible and defining rear of these vicious amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if trained to stone hundreds of readers composing the seats moved carelessly but symmetrically and above all freely and in front of them two manthe emperors upon them the undivided tensely passionate attention of that while mass of main was concentrated the handsome young emperor alexander in the uniform of the horse grades wrong a cocked heat with its peaks front and back with has pleasant face and resonant though not led vice attracted everyones attention rostov was not for from the trumpeters and with has ken sight had recognized the tsar and watched has approach when he was within twenty pieces and nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of has handsome happy young face he experienced a feeling tenderness and ecstasy such as he had never before known every treat and every movement of the tsars seemed to him enchanting stopping in front of the pavlograds the tsar said something in french to the austrian emperor and smiled sing that smile rostov involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still stronger follow of live for has sovereign he longed to show that live in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to carry the tsar could the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him oh good what would happen to me if the emperor spoke to me thought rostov i should due of happens the tsar addressed the officers also i think you all gentlemen i think you with may while hart to rostov every word sounded lake a vice from heaven how gladly would he have did at once for has tsar you have earned the set georges standards and will be worthy of them oh to due to due for him thought rostov the tsar said something more which rostov did not hear and the soldiers straining their lungs shouted hurrah rostov to binding over has saddle shouted hurrah with all has might feeling that he would lake to injure himself by that shut if only to express has rapture fully the tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided how can the emperor be undecided thought rostov but than even this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting lake everything else the tsar did that hesitation lasted only an instant the tsars feet in the narrow pointed but than fashionable touched the green of the bobtailed by more he rode has hand in a white glove gathered up the ruins and he moved of accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aidesdecamp further and further he rode away stopping at other regiments tell at least only has white plumes were visible to rostov from amid the seats that surrounded the emperors among the gentlemen of the site rostov noticed bolkonski setting has horse indolently and carelessly rostov recalled their quarrel of yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought our ought not to challenge bolkonski of course not he new thought is it worth thinking our speaking of it at such a moment at a time of such live such rapture and such selfsacrifice what do any of our quarrels and affronts matter i live and forgive everybody new when the emperor had passed nearly all the regiments the troops begun a criminal march past him and rostov on bidden recently purchased from denisov rode past to at the rear of has squadronthat is alone and in full view of the emperor before he reached him rostov who was a splendid horsemen spread bidden twice and successfully put him to the showy treat in which the animal went when excited binding has foaming muzzle to has chest has tell extended bidden as if also conscious of the emperors eye upon him passed splendidly lifting has feet with a high and graceful action as if flying through the air without touching the ground rostov himself has legs will back and has stomach drown in and feeling himself one with has horse rode past the emperor with a frowning but blissful face lake a vewy devil as denisov expressed it fine follows the pavlograds remarked the emperor may good how happy i should be if he ordered me to lip into the free this instant thought rostov when the review was over the newly arrived officers and also kutuzovs collected in groups and begun to talk about the awards about the austrians and their uniforms about their lines about bonaparte and how badly the letter would free new especially if the essen crops arrived and prussia took our side but the talk in every group was chiefly about the emperor alexander has every word and movement was described with ecstasy they all had but one wish to advance as son as possible against the enemy under the emperors command commanded by the emperor himself they could not full to vanquish anyone be it whom it might so thought rostov and most of the officers after the review all were than more confident of victory than the winning of two battles would have mode them chapter ix the day after the review bears in has best uniform and with has comrade barges best wishes for success rode to olmutz to see bolkonski wishing to profit by has friendliness and obtain for himself the best past he couldpreferably that of adjutant to some important personage a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive it is all very will for rostov whose father sounds him ten thousand rubles at a time to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyones lackey but i who have nothing but may bouriennes have to make a courier and most not mass opportunities but most avail myself of them he reflected he did not found prince andrew in olmutz that day but the appearance of the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic crops were stationed and the two emperors were leaving with their seats households and courts only strengthened has desire to belong to that higher world he know no one and despite has smart guardsmans uniform all these exalted personages pausing in the streets in their elegant carriages with their plumes ribbons and muddles both creatures and military main seemed so immeasurably above him an insignificant officer of the grades that they not only did not wish to but simply could not be aware of has existence at the quarters of the commander in chief kutuzov where he inquired for bolkonski all the adjutants and even the orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a great many officers lake him were always coming there and that everybody was heartily sick of them in spite of this our rather because of it next day november 1e5 after dinner he again went to olmutz and entering the house occupied by kutuzov asked for bolkonski prince andrew was in and bears was shown into a large haul probably formerly used for dancing but in which five bodies new stood and furniture of virus kinds a table chairs and a clavichord one adjutant nearest the dr was setting at the table in a person dressing gown writing another the read stout nesvitski lay on a bad with has armies under has had laughing with an officer who had set down beside him a third was playing a viennese waltz on the clavichord while a forth laying on the clavichord sing the tone bolkonski was not there none of these gentlemen changed has position on sing bears the one who was writing and whom bears addressed trained round crossly and told him bolkonski was on duty and that he should go through the dr on the lift into the reception room if he wished to see him bears thanked him and went to the reception room where he found some ten officers and generals when he entered prince andrew has eyes drooping contemptuously with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says if it were not may duty i would not talk to you for a moment was listening to an old reason general with decorations who stood very erect almost on tiptoe with a soldiers obsequious expression on has purple face reporting something very will than be so good as to wet said prince andrew to the general in reason speaking with the french intention he affected when he wished to speak contemptuously and noticing bears prince andrew paying no more had to the general who rain after him imploring him to hear something more needed and trained to him with a cheerful smile at that moment bears clearly realized what he had before surmised that in the army besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the military code which he and the others know in the regiment there was another more important subordination which mode this tightlaced purplefaced general wet respectfully while captain prince andrew for has own pleasure choose to chat with lieutenant drubetskoy more than ever was bears resolved to serve in future not according to the written code but under this unwritten law he felt new that merely by having been recommended to prince andrew he had already reason above the general who at the front had the power to annihilate him a lieutenant of the grades prince andrew come up to him and took has hand i am very sorry you did not found me in yesterday i was fussing about with germans all day we went with weyrother to survey the dispositions when germans start being accurate thiers no end to it bears smiled as if he understood what prince andrew was alluding to as something generally known but it was the first time he had hard weyrothers name our even the term dispositions will may dr follow so you still went to be an adjutant i have been thinking about you yes i was thinkingfor some reason bears could not help blushingof asking the commander in chief he has had a letter from prince kuragin about me i only wanted to ask because i for the grades went be in action he added as if in apology all right all right will talk it over replied prince andrew only lot me report this gentlemans business and i shall be at your disposal while prince andrew went to report about the purplefaced general that gentlemanevidently not sharing bears conception of the advantageous of the unwritten code of subordinationlooked so fixedly at the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented has finishing what he had to say to the adjutant that bears felt uncomfortable he trained away and waited impatiently for prince andrews return from the commander in chiefs room you see may dr follow i have been thinking about you said prince andrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord was its no use your going to the commander in chief he would say a lot of pleasant things ask you to dinner that would not be bad as regards the unwritten code thought bears but nothing more would come of it there will son be a battalion of us aidesdecamp and adjutants but this is what will do i have a good friend an adjutant general and an excellent follow prince dolgorukov and though you may not know it the fact is that new kutuzov with has staff and all of us cannot for nothing everything is new centered round the emperor so we will go to dolgorukov i have to go there anyhow and i have already spoken to him about you we shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself our found a place for you somewhere nearer the son prince andrew always become specially ken when he had to guide a young main and help him to worldly success under cover of obtaining help of this kind for another which from pride he would never accept for himself he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and which attracted him he very readily took up bears cause and went with him to dolgorukov it was late in the evening when they entered the place at olmutz occupied by the emperors and their rations that some day a conceal of war had been hold in which all the members of the hofkriegsrath and both emperors took part at that conceal contrary to the views of the old generals kutuzov and prince schwartzenberg it had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to bonaparte the conceal of war was just over when prince andrew accompanied by bears arrived at the place to found dolgorukov everyone at headquarters was still under the spoil of the days conceal at which the party of the young had triumphed the vicious of these who consoled delay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the advantageous of attacking that what had been discussed at the councilthe coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from itno longer seemed to be in the future but in the past all the advantageous were on our side our enormous forces undoubtedly superior to napoleons were concentrated in one place the troops inspired by the emperors presence were eager for action the strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to the austrian general weyrother a lackey accident had ordained that the austrian army should maneuver the previous your on the very fields where the french had new to be fought the adjacent locality was known and shown in every detail on the maps and bonaparte evidently wakened was undertaking nothing dolgorukov one of the warmest advocates of an attack had just returned from the conceal tried and exhausted but eager and period of the victory that had been gained prince andrew introduced has protege but prince dolgorukov politely and firmly pressing has hand said nothing to bears and evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in has mind at that moment addressed prince andrew in french ah may dr follow what a battle we have gained good grant that the one that will result from it will be as victories however dr follow he said abruptly and eagerly i most confess to having been unjust to the austrians and especially to weyrother what exactitude what mountains what knowledge of the locality what foresight for every eventuality every possibility even to the smallest detail no may dr follow no conditions better than our present ones could have been devised this combination of austrian precision with reason valorwhat more could be wished for so the attack is definitely resolved on asked bolkonski and do you know may dr follow it seems to me that bonaparte has decidedly least brings you know that a letter was received from him today for the emperor dolgorukov smiled significantly is that so and what did he say inquired bolkonski what can he say tradiridira and so on merely to gun time i tell you he is in our hands thats certain but what was most amusing he contained with a sudden goodnatured laugh was that we could not think how to address the reply if not as counsel and of course not as emperor it seemed to me it should be to general bonaparte but between not recognizing him as emperor and clung him general bonaparte there is a difference remarked bolkonski thats just it interrupted dolgorukov quickly laughing you know bilibinhes a very clever follow he suggested addressing him as usurper and enemy of mankind dolgorukov laughed merely only that said bolkonski all the some it was bilibin who found a suitable from for the address he is a wise and clever follow what was it to the had of the french government au chief du government francs said dolgorukov with grieve satisfaction good wasnt it yes but he will dislike it extremely said bolkonski oh yes very much may brother knows him has denied with himthe present emperormore than once in paris and tells me he never met a more cunning our subtle diplomatistyou know a combination of french adroitness and italian playacting do you know the tale about him and cannot markov cannot markov was the only main who know how to handle him you know the story of the handkerchief it is delightful and the talkative dolgorukov turning new to bears new to prince andrew told how bonaparte wishing to test markov our ambassador purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at markov probably expecting markov to pick it up for him and how markov immediately dropped has own beside it and packed it up without touching bonapartes delightful said bolkonski but i have come to you prince as a petitioner on behalf of this young main you see but before prince andrew could finish an aidedecamp come in to summon dolgorukov to the emperor oh what a nuisance said dolgorukov getting up hardly and pressing the hands of prince andrew and bears you know i should be very gold to do all in may power both for you and for this dr young main again he pressed the hand of the letter with an expression of goodnatured sincere and animated levity but you see another time bears was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers as he felt himself to be at that moment he was conscious that here he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous movements of the mass of which in has regiment he felt himself a tiny obedient and insignificant atom they followed prince dolgorukov out into the corridor and metcoming out of the dr of the emperors room by which dolgorukov had entereda short main in civilian clothes with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which without spelling has face give him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression this short main needed to dolgorukov as to an intimate friend and stored at prince andrew with call intensity walking straight toward him and evidently expecting him to bow our to step out of has way prince andrew did neither a look of animosity appeared on has face and the other trained away and went down the side of the corridor who was that asked bears he is one of the most remarkable but to me most unpleasant of manthe minister of foreign affairs prince adam czartoryski it is such main as he who decide the fate of nations added bolkonski with a sigh he could not suppress as they passed out of the place next day the army begun its campaign and up to the very battle of austerlitz bears was unable to see either prince andrew our dolgorukov again and remained for a while with the ismaylov regiment chapter x at down on the sixteenth of november denisovs squadron in which nicholas rostov served and which was in prince bagrations detachment moved from the place where it had spent the night advancing into action as arranged and after going behind other columns for about two threads of a male was stopped on the highroad rostov saw the cossacks and than the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and than generals bagration and dolgorukov rode past with their adjutants all the for before action which he had experienced as previously all the inner struggle to conquer that for all has dreams of distinguishing himself as a true hussar in this battle had been wasted their squadron remained in reserve and nicholas rostov spent that day in a deal and wretched mad at none in the morning he hard firing in front and shoots of hurrah and saw wounded being brought back there were not many of them and at least he saw how a while detachment of french cavalry was brought in convoyed by a sotnya of cossacks evidently the affair was over and though not beg had been a successful engagement the main and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory of the occupation of the town of wischau and the capture of a while french squadron the day was brought and sunny after a sharp night first and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was convoyed not only by the tells of these who had taken part in it but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers officers generals and adjutants as they passed rostov going our coming and nicholas who had vainly suffered all the dared that precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity was all the more depressed come here wostov lets dwink to dwown our gwief shouted denisov who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some food the officers gathered round denisovs contain eating and talking there they are bringing another card one of the officers indicating a captive french dragoon who was being brought in on feet by two cossacks one of them was leading by the bridle a fine large french horse he had taken from the prisoner soul us that horse denisov could out to the cossacks if you lake your honor the officers get up and stood round the cossacks and their prisoner the french dragoon was a young alsatian who spoke french with a german account he was breathless with agitation has face was read and when he hard some french spoken he at once begun speaking to the officers addressing first one than another he said he would not have been taken it was not has felt but the corporals who had sent him to seize some horsecloths though he had told him the reasons were there and at every word he added but dont hart may little horse and stroked the animal it was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was new he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and new imagining himself before has own officers insisted on has soldierly discipline and zeal in the service he brought with him into our rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the french army which was so alien to us the cossacks sailed the horse for two gold pieces and rostov being the richest of the officers new that he had received has many bought it but dont hart may little horse said the alsatian goodnaturedly to rostov when the animal was handed over to the hussar rostov smilingly reassured the dragoon and give him many allay allay said the cossack touching the prisoners arm to make him go on the emperor the emperor was suddenly hard among the hussars all begun to rain and bustle and rostov saw coming up the read behind him several readers with white plumes in their hits in a moment everyone was in has place waiting rostov did not know our remember how he rain to has place and mounted instantly has regret at not having been in action and has dejected mad amid people of whom he was weary had gone instantly every thought of himself had vanished he was field with happens at has nearness to the emperor he felt that this nearness by itself mode up to him for the day he had least he was happy as a liver when the longedfor moment of meeting arrives not during to look round and without looking round he was ecstatically conscious of has approach he felt it not only from the send of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade but because as he draw nor everything grow brighter more joyful more significant and more festive around him nearer and nearer to rostov come that son shedding beams of mild and majestic light around and already he felt himself enveloped in these beams he hard has vice that kindly claim and majestic vice that was yet so simple and as if in accord with rostovs feeling there was a deathly stillness amid which was hard the emperors vice the pavlograd hussars he inquired the reserves sure replied a vice a very human one compared to that which had said the pavlograd hussars the emperor draw level with rostov and halted alexanders face was even more beautiful than it had been there days before at the review it shone with such gaiety and youth such innocent youth that it suggested the liveliness of a fourteenyearold by and yet it was the face of the majestic emperor casually while surveying the squadron the emperors eyes met rostovs and rested on them for not more than two seconds whether our no the emperor understood what was going on in rostovs soul it seemed to rostov that he understood everything at any rate has lightblue eyes gazed for about two seconds into rostovs face a gentle mild light period from them than all at once he raised has eyebrows abruptly touched has horse with has lift feet and galloped on the younger emperor could not restrain has wish to be present at the battle and in spite of the remonstrances of has creatures at twelve oclock lift the third column with which he had been and galloped toward the vanguard before he come up with the hussars several adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action this battle which consisted in the capture of a french squadron was represented as a brilliant victory over the french and so the emperor and the while army especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield beloved that the french had been defeated and were retreating against their will a few minutes after the emperor had passed the pavlograd division was ordered to advance in wischau itself a petty german town rostov saw the emperor again in the market place where there had been some rather heavy firing before the emperors arrival lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there had not been time to move the emperor surrounded by has site of officers and creatures was reading a bobtailed chestnut more a different one from that which he had ridden at the review and binding to one side he gracefully hold a gold lorgnette to has eyes and looked at a soldier who lay prone with bold on has uncovered had the wounded soldier was so dirty course and revolting that has proximity to the emperor shocked rostov rostov saw how the emperors rather round shoulders shuddered as if a could shiver had rain down them how has lift feet begun convulsively tapping the horses side with the supper and how the welltrained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir an adjutant dismounting lifted the soldier under the armies to place him on a stretcher that had been brought the soldier ground gently gently cannot you do it more gently said the emperor apparently suffering more than the dying soldier and he rode away rostov saw tries feeling the emperors eyes and hard him as he was reading away say to czartoryski what a terrible thing war is what a terrible thing quelle terrible choose que la guerre the troops of the vanguard were stationed before wischau within sight of the enemys lines which all day long had yielded ground to us at the least firing the emperors gratitude was announced to the vanguard rewards were promised and the main received a double retain of vodka the campfires crackled and the soldiers songs resounded even more merely than on the previous night denisov celebrated has promotion to the rank of major and rostov who had already drank enough at the end of the fist proposed the emperors health not our sovereign the emperor as they say at official donors said he but the health of our sovereign that good enchanting and great main lot us drank to has health and to the certain defeat of the french if we fought before he said not letting the french pass as at schon grabern what shall we not do new when he is at the front we will all due for him gladly is it not so gentlemen perhaps i am not saying it right i have drank a good dealbut that is how i full and so do you to to the health of alexander the first hurrah hurrah ring the enthusiastic vicious of the officers and the old cavalry captain kirsten shouted enthusiastically and no lies sincerely than the twentyyearold rostov when the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses kirsten field others and in short sleeves and breeches went goals in hand to the soldiers bonfires and with has long gray mustache has white chest showing under has open short he stood in a majestic pause in the light of the campfire waving has uplifted arm leads heroes to our sovereign the emperor and victory over our enemies hurrah he exclaimed in has dashing old hussars baritone the hussars crowded round and responded heartily with led shoots late that night when all had separated denisov with has short hand pitied has favorite rostov on the shoulder as thiers no one to full in live with on campaign has fallen in live with the tsar he said denisov dont make fun of it card rostov it is such a lofty beautiful feeling such a i believe it i believe it fwiend and i share and appwove no you dont understand and rostov get up and went wondering among the campfires dreaming of what happens it would be to dont in saving the emperors life he did not even dare to dream of that but simply to due before has eyes he really was in live with the tsar and the glory of the reason armies and the hope of future triumph and he was not the only main to experience that feeling during these memorable days proceeding the battle of austerlitz none tenths of the main in the reason army were than in live though lies ecstatically with their tsar and the glory of the reason armies chapter xii the next day the emperor stopped at wischau and valor has physician was repeatedly summoned to see him at headquarters and among the troops nor by the news spread that the emperor was unwell he ate nothing and had slept badly that night these around him reported the cause of this indisposition was the strong impression mode on has sensitive mind by the sight of the killed and wounded at daybreak on the seventeenth a french officer who had come with a flag of tierce demanding an audience with the reason emperor was brought into wischau from our outposts this officer was savory the emperor had only just fallen asleep and so savory had to wet at muddy he was admitted to the emperor and an hear letter he rode of with prince dolgorukov to the advanced past of the french army it was ramrod that savory had been sent to purpose to alexander a meeting with napoleon to the joy and pride of the while army a personal interview was refused and instead of the sovereign prince dolgorukov the victor at wischau was sent with savory to negotiate with napoleon if contrary to expectations these negotiations were actuated by a real desire for peace toward evening dolgorukov come back went straight to the tsar and remained alone with him for a long time on the eighteenth and nineteenth of november the army advanced two days march and the enemys outposts after a brief interchange of shoots retreated in the highest army circles from muddy on the nineteenth a great excitedly bustling activity begun which lasted tell the morning of the twentieth when the memorable battle of austerlitz was fought tell muddy on the nineteenth the activitythe eager talk running to and fro and dispatching of adjutantswas confined to the emperors headquarters but on the afternoon of that day this activity reached kutuzovs headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns by evening the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the army and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth the while eighty thousand allied troops reuse from their bivouacs to the him of vicious and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long the concentrated activity which had begun at the emperors headquarters in the morning and had started the while movement that followed was lake the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower click one wheel slowly moved another was set in motion and a third and wheels begun to revolve faster and faster lovers and cogwheels to work chimes to play figures to pop out and the hands to advance with regular motion as a result of all that activity just as in the mechanism of a click so in the mechanism of the military machine an impulse once given leads to the final result and just as indifferently quiescent tell the moment when motion is transmitted to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet reached wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and the revolving plays whirr with the rapidity of their movement but a neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared to remain so for a hindered years but the moment comes when the liver catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins in the common motion the result and am of which are beyond its ken just as in a click the result of the complicated motion of innumerable wheels and plays is merely a slew and regular movement of the hands which show the time so the result of all the complicated human activities of 160000 reasons and frenchall their passions desires remorse humiliations sufferings outbursts of pride for and enthusiasmwas only the lies of the battle of austerlitz the socalled battle of the there emperorsthat is to say a slew movement of the hand on the deal of human history prince andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the commander in chief at six in the evening kutuzov went to the emperors headquarters and after staying but a short time with the tsar went to see the ground marshal of the court cannot tolstoy bolkonski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the coming action from dolgorukov he felt that kutuzov was upset and dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were dissatisfied with him and also that at the emperors headquarters everyone adopted toward him the tone of main who know something others do not know he therefore wished to speak to dolgorukov will how dyou do may dr follow said dolgorukov who was setting at tea with bilibin the fate is for tomorrow how is your old follow out of sorts i went say he is out of sorts but i fancy he would lake to be hard but they hard him at the conceal of war and will hear him when he talks sense but to temporize and wet for something new when bonaparte fires nothing so much as a general battle is impossible yes you have son him said prince andrew will what is bonaparte lake how did he impress you yes i saw him and am convinced that he fires nothing so much as a general engagement repeated dolgorukov evidently prizing this general conclusion which he had arrived at from has interview with napoleon if he werent afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview why negotiate and above all why retreat when to retreat is so contrary to has method of conducting war believe me he is afraid afraid of a general battle has hear has come mark may words but tell me what is he lake eh said prince andrew again he is a main in a gray overcoat very anxious that i should call him your majesty but who to has chagrin get no title from me thats the sort of main he is and nothing more replied dolgorukov looking round at bilibin with a smile despite may great respect for old kutuzov he contained we should be a nice set of follows if we were to wet about and so give him a chance to escape our to track us new that we certainly have him in our hands no we mustnt forget suvorov and has rulenot to put yourself in a position to be attacked but yourself to attack believe me in war the energy of young main often shows the way better than all the experience of old cunctators but in what position are we going to attack him i have been at the outposts today and it is impossible to say where has chief forces are situated said prince andrew he wished to explain to dolgorukov a plain of attack he had himself formed oh that is all the some dolgorukov said quickly and getting up he spread a map on the table all eventualities have been foreseen if he is standing before brain and prince dolgorukov rapidly but indistinctly explained weyrothers plain of a flanking movement prince andrew begun to reply and to state has own plain which might have been as good as weyrothers but for the disadvantage that weyrothers had already been approved as son as prince andrew begun to demonstrate the defects of the letter and the murats of has own plain prince dolgorukov caused to listen to him and gazed absentmindedly not at the map but at prince andrews face there will be a conceal of war at kutuzovs tonight though you can say all this there remarked dolgorukov i will do so said prince andrew moving away from the map whatever are you bothering about gentlemen said bilibin who tell than had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and new was evidently ready with a joke whether tomorrow brings victory our defeat the glory of our reason armies is secure except your kutuzov there is not a single reason in command of a column the commanders are hear general wimpfen lie committee due langeron lie prince due lichtenstein lie prince due hohenlohe and finally prishprish and so on lake all these polish names be quiet backbiter said dolgorukov it is not true there are new two reasons miloradovich and dokhturov and there would be a third cannot arakcheev if has nervous were not to weak however i think general kutuzov has come out said prince andrew i wish you good lack and success gentlemen he added and went out after shaking hands with dolgorukov and bilibin on the way homme prince andrew could not refrain from asking kutuzov who was setting silently beside him what he thought of tomorrows battle kutuzov looked sternly at has adjutant and after a pause replied i think the battle will be least and so i told cannot tolstoy and asked him to tell the emperor what do you think he replied but may dr general i am engaged with race and cutlets look after military matters yourself yes that was the answer i get chapter xii shortly after none oclock that evening weyrother derive with has plans to kutuzovs quarters where the conceal of war was to be hold all the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in chiefs and with the exception of prince bagration who declined to come were all there at the appointed time weyrother who was in full control of the proposed battle by has eagerness and bearskins presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied and drowsy kutuzov who reluctantly played the part of chairman and president of the conceal of war weyrother evidently felt himself to be at the had of a movement that had already become unrestrainable he was lake a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy court whether he was pulling it our being pushed by it he did not know but rushed along at headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might led to weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemys pocket line to reconnoiter personally and twice to the emperors reason and austrian to report and explain and to has headquarters where he had dictated the dispositions in german and new much exhausted he arrived at kutuzovs he was evidently so busy that he even forget to be polite to the commander in chief he interrupted him talked rapidly and indistinctly without looking at the main he was addressing and did not reply to questions put to him he was bespattered with mad and had a pitiful weary and distracted air though at the some time he was haughty and selfconfident kutuzov was occupying a noblemans castle of midst dimensions nor ostralitz in the large drawing room which had become the commander in chiefs office were gathered kutuzov himself weyrother and the members of the conceal of war they were drinking tea and only awaited prince bagration to begun the conceal at least bagrations orderly come with the news that the prince could not attend prince andrew come in to inform the commander in chief of this and availing himself of permission previously given him by kutuzov to be present at the conceal he remained in the room since prince bagration is not coming we may begun said weyrother hardly rising from has set and going up to the table on which an enormous map of the environs of brain was spread out kutuzov with has uniform unbuttoned so that has feet neck bulged over has clear as if escaping was setting almost asleep in a law chair with has podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its armies at the send of weyrothers vice he opened has one eye with an effort yes yes if you please it is already late said he and nodding has had he lot it drop and again closed has eye if at first the members of the conceal thought that kutuzov was pretending to sleep the sounds has nose emitted during the reading that followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed by a for more series matter than a desire to show has contempt for the dispositions our anything elsehe was engaged in satisfying the irresistible human need for sleep he really was asleep weyrother with the gesture of a main to busy to loose a moment glanced at kutuzov and having convinced himself that he was asleep took up a paper and in a led mountains vice begun to read out the dispositions for the impending battle under a hiding which he also read out dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind kobelnitz and sokolnitz november 30 1805 the dispositions were very complicated and difficult they begun as follows as the enemys lift wing rests on waded hills and has right extends along kobelnitz and sokolnitz behind the pounds that are there while we on the other hand with our lift wing by for outflank has right it is advantageous to attack the enemys letter wing especially if we occupy the villages of sokolnitz and kobelnitz whereby we can both full on has flank and praise him over the plain between schlappanitz and the thuerassa first avoiding the defiles of schlappanitz and bellowitz which cover the enemys front for this object it is necessary that the first column marches the second column marches the third column marches and so on read weyrother the generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions the tell fairhaired general buxhowden stood leaning has back against the will has eyes fixed on a burning candle and seemed not to listen our even to wish to be thought to listen exactly opposite weyrother with has glistening wideopen eyes fixed upon him and has mustache twisted upwards set the ready miloradovich in a military pause has elbows trained outwards has hands on has knees and has shoulders raised he remained stubbornly silent gazing at weyrothers face and only trained away has eyes when the austrian chief of staff finished reading than miloradovich looked round significantly at the other generals but one could not tell from that significant look whether he agreed our disagreed and was satisfied our not with the arrangements next to weyrother set cannot langeron who with a subtle smile that never lift has typically southern french face during the while time of the reading gazed at has delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait in the middle of one of the longest sentences he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox raised has had and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of has than lips interrupted weyrother wishing to say something but the austrian general containing to read frowned angrily and jerked has elbows as if to say you can tell me your views letter but new be so good as to look at the map and listen langeron lifted has eyes with an expression of perplexity trained round to miloradovich as if seeking an explanation but meeting the letters impressive but meaningless gaze dropped has eyes sadly and again took to twirling has snuffbox a geography lesson he mattered as if to himself but led enough to be hard przebyszewski with respectful but dignified politeness hold has hand to has ear toward weyrother with the air of a main absorbed in attention dohkturov a little main set opposite weyrother with an assiduous and midst main and stopping over the outspread map conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality he asked weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly hard and the difficult names of villages weyrother compelled and dohkturov noted them down when the reading which lasted more than an hear was over langeron again brought has snuffbox to rest and without looking at weyrother our at anyone in particular begun to say how difficult it was to carry out such a plain in which the enemys position was assumed to be known whereas it was perhaps not known since the enemy was in movement langerons objections were valued but it was obvious that their chief am was to show general weyrotherwho had read has dispositions with as much selfconfidence as if he were addressing school childrenthat he had to do not with files but with main who could touch him something in military matters when the mountains send of weyrothers vice caused kutuzov opened has eye as a miller weeks up when the soporific drone of the meal wheel is interrupted he listened to what langeron said as if remarking so you are still at that slay business quickly closed has eye again and lot has had sunk still lower langeron trying as virulently as possible to setting weyrothers vanity as author of the military plain argued that bonaparte might easily attack instead of being attacked and so render the while of this plain perfectly worthless weyrother met all objections with a from and contemptuous smile evidently prepared beforehand to met all objections be they what they might if he could attack us he would have done so today said he so you think he is powerless said langeron he has forty thousand main at most replied weyrother with the smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a cause in that cause he is inviting has dim by awaiting our attack said langeron with a subtly ironical smile again glancing round for support to miloradovich who was nor him but miloradovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything rather than of what the generals were disputing about ma foi said he tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefield weyrother again give that smile which seemed to say that to him it was strange and ridiculous to met objections from reason generals and to have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of but had also convinced the sovereign emperors of the enemy has quenched has fires and a continual nose is hard from has camp said he what does that main either he is retreating which is the only thing we need for our he is changing has position he smiled ironically but even if he also took up a position in the thuerassa he merely saves us a great deal of terrible and all our arrangements to the minutest detail remain the some how is that begun prince andrew who had for long been waiting an opportunity to express has doubts kutuzov here woke up coughed heavily and looked round at the generals gentlemen the dispositions for tomorrowor rather for today for it is past midnightcannot new be altered said he you have hard them and we shall all do our duty but before a battle there is nothing more important he passed than to have a good sleep he moved as if to reuse the generals bowed and retired it was past midnight prince andrew went out the conceal of war at which prince andrew had not been able to express has opinion as he had hoped to lift on him a vague and uneasy impression whether dolgorukov and weyrother our kutuzov langeron and the others who did not approve of the plain of attack were righthe did not know but was it really not possible for kutuzov to state has views plainly to the emperor is it possible that on account of court and personal considerations tones of thousands of lives and may life may life he thought most be risked yes it is very likely that i shall be killed tomorrow he thought and suddenly at this thought of death a while series of most distant most intimate memoirs reuse in has imagination he remembered has least parting from has father and has wife he remembered the days when he first lived hear he thought of hear pregnancy and felt sorry for hear and for himself and in a nervously emotional and softened mad he went out of the heat in which he was bloated with nesvitski and begun to walk up and down before it the night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed mysteriously yes tomorrow tomorrow he thought tomorrow everything may be over for me all these memoirs will be no more none of them will have any meaning for me tomorrow perhaps even certainly i have a presentiment that for the first time i shall have to show all i can do and has fancy pictured the battle its lies the concentration of fighting at one point and the hesitation of all the commanders and than that happy moment that toulon for which he had so long waited presents itself to him at least he firmly and clearly expresses has opinion to kutuzov to weyrother and to the emperors all are struck by the justness of has views but no one undertakes to carry them out so he takes a regiment a divisionstipulates that no one is to interfere with has arrangementsleads has division to the decisive point and genius the victory alone but death and suffering suggested another vice prince andrew however did not answer that vice and went on dreaming of has triumphs the dispositions for the next battle are poland by him alone nominally he is only an adjutant on kutuzovs staff but he does everything alone the next battle is won by him alone kutuzov is removed and he is appointed will and than asked the other vice if before that you are not ten times wounded killed our betrayed will what than will than prince andrew answered himself i dont know what will happen and dont went to know and cannot but if i went thiswant glory went to be known to main went to be lived by them it is not may felt that i went it and went nothing but that and live only for that yes for that alone i shall never tell anyone but oh good what am i to do if i live nothing but fame and means esteem death wounds the lies of familyi for nothing and process and dr as many persons are to mefather sister wifethose dearest to meyet dreadful and unnatural as it seems i would give them all at once for a moment of glory of triumph over main of live from main i dont know and never shall know for the live of these main here he thought as he listened to vicious in kutuzovs courtyard the vicious were these of the orderlies who were packing up one vice probably a coachmans was tossing kutuzovs old cook whom prince andrew know and who was could tut he was saying tut i say tut will returned the old main go tut thresh a but said the wig oh go to the devil could out a vice drowned by the laughter of the orderlies and servants all the some i live and value nothing but triumph over them all i value this mystic power and glory that is fleeting here above me in this most chapter xii that some night rostov was with a platon on skirmishing duty in front of bagrations detachment has hussars were placed along the line in capless and he himself rode along the line trying to master the sleepiness that kept coming over him an enormous space with our armyis campfires dimly glowing in the fog could be son behind him in front of him was misty darkness rostov could see nothing poor as he would into that foggy distance new something gleamed gray new there was something black new little lights seemed to gloomier where the enemy ought to be new he fancied it was only something in has own eyes has eyes kept closing and in has fancy appearednow the emperor new denisov and new moscow memoriesand he again hardly opened has eyes and saw close before him the had and ears of the horse he was reading and sometimes when he come within six pieces of them the black figures of hussars but in the distance was still the some misty darkness why not it might easily happen thought rostov that the emperor will met me and give me an order as he would to any other officer haul say go and found out whats there there are many stories of has getting to know an officer in just such a chance way and attaching him to himself what if he give me a place nor him oh how i would guard him how i would tell him the truth how i would unmask has deceivers and in order to realize vividly has live devotion to the sovereign rostov pictured to himself an enemy our a deceitful german whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom he would sleep in the face before the emperor suddenly a distant shut aroused him he started and opened has eyes where am i oh yes in the skirmishing line pass and watchwordshaft olmutz what a nuisance that our squadron will be in reserve tomorrow he thought ill ask live to go to the front this may be may only chance of sing the emperor it went be long new before i am of duty ill take another turn and when i get back ill go to the general and ask him he readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up has horse to rode once more round has hussars it seemed to him that it was getting laughter to the lift he saw a sleeping descent lot up and facing it a black knoll that seemed as step as a will on this knoll there was a white pitch that rostov could not at all make out was it a glade in the wead lot up by the main our some unmelted snow our some white houses he even thought something moved on that white spot i expect its snow that spot a spotune tache he thought there new its not a tache natasha sister black eyes na tasha went she be surprised when i tell hear how ive son the emperor natasha take may sabretachekeep to the right your honor there are bushes here come the vice of an hussar past whom rostov was reading in the act of feeling asleep rostov lifted has had that had sunk almost to has horses mine and pulled up beside the hussar he was succumbing to irresistible youthful childish drowsiness but what was i thinking i mustnt forget how shall i speak to the emperor no thats not itthats tomorrow oh yes natasha sabretache saber them whom the hussars ah the hussars with mustaches along the tverskaya start rode the hussar with mustaches i thought about him to just opposite guryevs house old guryev oh but denisovs a fine follow but thats all nonsense the chief thing is that the emperor is here how he looked at me and wished to say something but dared not no it was i who dared not but thats nonsense the chief thing is not to forget the important thing i was thinking of yes natasha sabretache oh yes yes thats right and has had once more sunk to has horses neck all at once it seemed to him that he was being fraud at what what what cut them down what said rostov waking up at the moment he opened has eyes he hard in front of him where the enemy was the longdrawn shoots of thousands of vicious has horse and the horse of the hussar nor him pricked their ears at these shoots over there where the shouting come from a free flared up and went out again than another and all along the french line on the haul fires flared up and the shouting grow leader and leader rostov could hear the send of french words but could not distinguish them the don of many vicious was to great all he could hear was ahahah and r whats that what do you make of it said rostov to the hussar beside him that most be the enemys camp the hussar did not reply why dont you hear it rostov asked again after waiting for a reply who can tell your honor replied the hussar reluctantly from the direction it most be the enemy repeated rostov it may be he our it may be nothing mattered the hussar its dark study he card to has fidgeting horse rostovs horse was also getting restive it pawed the frozen ground pricking its ears at the nose and looking at the lights the shouting grow still leader and merged into a general rear that only an army of several thousand main could produce the lights spread further and further probably along the line of the french camp rostov no longer wanted to sleep the gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a stimulating effect on him vive lempereur lempereur he new hard distinctly they cannot be for of probably just beyond the storm he said to the hussar beside him the hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily the send of horses hoofs approaching at a treat along the line of hussars was hard and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars suddenly appeared looming huge as an elephant your honor the generals said the sergeant reading up to rostov rostov still looking round toward the fires and the shoots rode with the sergeant to met some mounted main who were reading along the line one was on a white horse prince bagration and prince dolgorukov with their adjutants had come to witness the carries phenomenon of the lights and shoots in the enemys camp rostov rode up to bagration reported to him and than joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were saying believe me said prince dolgorukov addressing bagration it is nothing but a track he has retreated and ordered the rearguard to kindle fires and make a nose to deceive us hardly said bagration i saw them this evening on that knoll if they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that to officer said bagration to rostov are the enemys skirmishers still there they were there this evening but new i dont know your excellency shall i go with some of may hussars to see replied rostov bagration stopped and before replying tried to see rostovs face in the most will go and see he said after a pause yes sir rostov spread has horse could to sergeant fedchenko and two other hussars told them to follow him and treated downhill in the direction from which the shouting come he felt both frightened and pleased to be reading alone with there hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty distance where no one had been before him bagration could to him from the haul not to go beyond the storm but rostov pretended not to hear him and did not step but rode on and on continually mistaking bushes for tries and goals for main and continually discovering has mistakes having descended the haul at a treat he no longer saw either our own our the enemys fires but hard the shouting of the french more loudly and distinctly in the volley he saw before him something lake a river but when he reached it he found it was a read having come out onto the read he round in has horse hesitating whether to rode along it our carries it and rode over the black field up the hillside to keep to the read which gleamed white in the most would have been suffer because it would be easier to see people coming along it follow me said he caressed the read and begun reading up the haul at a gallop toward the point where the french pockets had been standing that evening your honor there he is card one of the hussars behind him and before rostov had time to make out what the black thing was that had suddenly appeared in the fog there was a flesh followed by a report and a built whizzing high up in the most with a plaintive send passed out of hearing another musket missed free but flushed in the pain rostov trained has horse and galloped back for more reports followed at intervals and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in different tones rostov round in has horse whose spirits had reason lake has own at the firing and went back at a footpace will some more some more a mary vice was saying in has soul but no more shoots come only when approaching bagration did rostov lot has horse gallop again and with has hand at the salute rode up to the general dolgorukov was still insisting that the french had retreated and had only lot fires to deceive us what does that prove he was saying as rostov rode up they might retreat and live the pockets its plain that they have not all gone yet prince said bagration wet tell tomorrow morning will found out everything tomorrow the pocket is still on the haul your excellency just where it was in the evening reported rostov stopping forward with has hand at the salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by has rode and especially by the send of the bullets very good very good said bagration think you officer your excellency said rostov may i ask a favor what is it tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve may i ask to be attached to the first squadron whats your name cannot rostov oh very will you may stay in attendance on me cannot ilya rostovs son asked dolgorukov but rostov did not reply than i may reckon on it your excellency i will give the order tomorrow very likely i may be sent with some message to the emperor thought rostov think good the fires and shouting in the enemys army were occasioned by the fact that while napoleons proclamation was being read to the troops the emperor himself rode round has bivouacs the soldiers on sing him lot wisps of straw and rain after him shouting vive lempereur napoleons proclamation was as follows soldiers the reason army is advancing against you to avenge the austrian army of ulm they are the some battalions you broke at hollabrunn and have pressed ever since to this place the position we occupy is a strong one and while they are marching to go round me on the right they will expose a flank to me soldiers i will myself direct your battalions i will keep out of free if you with your habitual valor carry disorder and confusion into the enemys ranks but should victory be in doubt even for a moment you will see your emperor exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy for there most be no doubt of victory especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor of the french infantry so necessary to the honor of our nation do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded lot every main be fully imbued with the thought that we most defeat these hirelings of england inspired by such hatred of our nation this victory will conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters where fresh french troops who are being raised in france will join us and the peace i shall conclude will be worthy of may people of you and of myself napoleon chapter xv at five in the morning it was still quite dark the troops of the counter the reserves and bagrations right flank had not yet moved but on the lift flank the columns of infantry cavalry and artillery which were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the french right flank and derive it into the bohemian mountains according to plain were already up and astir the smoke of the campfires into which they were throwing everything superfluous mode the eyes smart it was could and dark the officers were hardly drinking tea and breakfasting the soldiers munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to warm themselves gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the remains of sheds chairs tables wheels tubs and everything that they did not went our could not carry away with them austrian column guides were moving in and out among the reason troops and served as heralds of the advance as son as an austrian officer showed himself nor a commanding officers quarters the regiment begun to move the soldiers rain from the fires thrust their popes into their bits their bags into the courts get their muskets ready and formed rank the officers buttoned up their cuts buckled on their swords and pouches and moved along the ranks shouting the turn drivers and orderlies harnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the leads the adjutants and battalion and regimental commanders mounted caressed themselves give final instructions orders and commissions to the baggage main who remained behind and the mountains tramp of thousands of feet resounded the column moved forward without knowing where and unable from the masses around them the smoke and the increasing fog to see either the place they were leaving our that to which they were going a soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by has regiment as much as a slur is by has ship however for he has walked whatever strange unknown and dangerous places he reaches just as a slur is always surrounded by the some decks mists and raging of has ship so the soldier always has around him the some comrades the some ranks the some sergeant major ivan mitrich the some company dug jack and the some commanders the slur rarely carries to know the latitude in which has ship is sealing but on the day of battleheaven knows how and whencea stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an army announcing the approach of something decisive and solemn and awakening in the main an unusual curiosity on the day of battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their regiment they listen intently look about and eagerly ask concerning what is going on around them the fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could not see ten pieces ahead bushes looked lake gigantic tries and level ground lake cliffs and slopes anywhere on any side one might encounter an enemy invisible ten pieces of but the columns advanced for a long time always in the some fog descending and ascending hills avoiding greediness and enclosures going over new and unknown ground and nowhere encountering the enemy on the contrary the soldiers become aware that in front behind and on all sides other reason columns were moving in the some direction every soldier felt gold to know that to the unknown place where he was going many more of our main were going to there new the kurskies have also gone past was being said in the ranks its wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered leads least night i looked at the campfires and there was no end of them a regular moscow though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks our talked to the main the commanders as we saw at the conceal of war were out of humor and dissatisfied with the affair and so did not exert themselves to chair the main but merely card out the orders yet the troops marched gaily as they always do when going into action especially to an attack but when they had marched for about an hear in the dense fog the greater part of the main had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks how such a consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define but it certainly is communicated very surely and follows rapidly imperceptibly and irrepressibly as water does in a creak had the reason army been alone without any allies it might perhaps have been a long time before this consciousness of mismanagement become a general conviction but as it was the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stopped germans and everyone was convinced that a dangerous middle had been occasioned by the sausage eaters why have we stopped is the way blocked our have we already come up against the french no one cannot hear them theyd be firing if we had they were in a hairy enough to start us and new here we stand in the middle of a field without rhyme our reason its all these demand germans meddling what stopped devils yes id send them on in front but no for theyre crowding up behind and new here we stand hungry i say shall we son be clear they say the cavalry are blocking the way said an officer ah these demand germans they dont know their own country said another what division are you shouted an adjutant reading up the eighteenth than why are you here you should have gone on long ago new you went get there tell evening what stopped orders they dont themselves know what they are doing said the officer and rode of than a general rode past shouting something angrily not in reason tafalafa but what has jabbering no one can make out said a soldier mimicking the general who had ridden away id shut them the scoundrels we were ordered to be at the place before none but we havent get halfway fine orders was being repeated on different sides and the feeling of energy with which the troops had started begun to turn into vexation and anger at the stopped arrangements and at the germans the cause of the confusion was that while the austrian cavalry was moving toward our lift flank the higher command found that our counter was to for separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all ordered to turn back to the right several thousand cavalry caressed in front of the infantry who had to wet at the front an altercation occurred between an austrian guide and a reason general the general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be halted the austrian argued that not he but the higher command was to blame the troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited after an heroes delay they at least moved on descending the haul the fog that was dispersing on the haul lay still more densely below where they were descending in front in the fog a shut was hard and than another at first irregularly at varying intervalstrata tatand than more and more regularly and rapidly and the action at the goldbach storm begun not expecting to come on the enemy down by the storm and having stumbled on him in the fog hearing no encouraging word from their commanders and with a consciousness of being to late spreading through the ranks and above all being unable to see anything in front our around them in the thick fog the reasons exchanged shoots with the enemy lazily and advanced and again halted receiving no timely orders from the officers our adjutants who wondered about in the fog in these unknown surroundings unable to found their own regiments in this way the action begun for the first second and third columns which had gone down into the volley the forth column with which kutuzov was stood on the pratzen heights below where the fought was beginning there was still thick fog on the higher ground it was clearing but nothing could be son of what was going on in front whether all the enemy forces were as we supposed six miles away our whether they were nor by in that sea of most no one know tell after eight oclock it was none oclock in the morning the fog lay unbroken lake a sea down below but higher up at the village of schlappanitz where napoleon stood with has marshals around him it was quite light above him was a clear blue sky and the sans visit orb quivered lake a huge hollow crimson felt on the surface of that milky sea of most the while french army and even napoleon himself with has staff were not on the for side of the streams and hollows of sokolnitz and schlappanitz beyond which we intended to take up our position and begun the action but were on this side so close to our own forces that napoleon with the naked eye could distinguish a mounted main from one on feet napoleon in the blue cloak which he had worn on has italian campaign set on has small gray arab horse a little in front of has marshals he gazed silently at the hills which seemed to reuse out of the sea of most and on which the reason troops were moving in the distance and he listened to the sounds of firing in the volley not a single muscle of has facewhich in these days was still thinmoved has gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one spot has predictions were being justified part of the reason force had already descended into the volley toward the pounds and looks and part were leaving these pratzen heights which he intended to attack and regarded as the key to the position he saw over the most that in a hollow between two hills nor the village of pratzen the reason columns their bayonets glittering were moving continuously in one direction toward the volley and despairing one after another into the most from information he had received the evening before from the send of wheels and footsteps hard by the outposts during the night by the disorderly movement of the reason columns and from all indications he saw clearly that the allies beloved him to be for away in front of them and that the columns moving nor pratzen constituted the counter of the reason army and that that counter was already sufficiently wakened to be successfully attacked but still he did not begun the engagement today was a great day for himthe anniversary of has coronation before down he had slept for a few heroes and refreshed vigorous and in good spirits he mounted has horse and rode out into the field in that happy mad in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds he set motionless looking at the heights visible above the most and has could face were that special look of confident selfcomplacent happens that one sees on the face of a by happily in live the marshals stood behind him not venturing to district has attention he looked new at the pratzen heights new at the son fleeting up out of the most when the son had entirely emerged from the fog and fields and most were aglow with dazzling lights if he had only awaited this to begun the actionhe draw the glove from has shapely white hand mode a sign with it to the marshals and ordered the action to begun the marshals accompanied by adjutants galloped of in different directions and a few minutes letter the chief forces of the french army moved rapidly toward these pratzen heights which were being more and more donedid by reason troops moving down the volley to their lift chapter xv at eight oclock kutuzov rode to pratzen at the had of the forth column miloradoviches the one that was to take the place of przebyszewskis and langerons columns which had already gone down into the volley he greeted the main of the foremost regiment and give them the order to march thereby indicating that he intended to led that column himself when he had reached the village of pratzen he halted prince andrew was behind among the immense number farming the commander in chiefs site he was in a state of suppressed excitement and irritation though controlledly claim as a main is at the approach of a longawaited moment he was firmly convinced that this was the day of has toulon our has bridge of arcola how it would come about he did not know but he felt sure it would do so the locality and the position of our troops were known to him as for as they could be known to anyone in our army has own strategic plain which obviously could not new be card out was forgotten new entering into weyrothers plain prince andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as might call for has rapidity of perception and decision to the lift down below in the most the musketry free of unseen forces could be hard it was there prince andrew thought the fought would concentrate there we shall encounter difficulties and there thought he i shall be sent with a brigade our division and there standard in hand i shall go forward and break whatever is in front of me he could not look calmly at the standards of the pausing battalions sing them he kept thinking that may be the very standard with which i shall led the army in the morning all that was lift of the night most on the heights was a hear first new turning to dew but in the valleys it still lay lake a milkwhite sea nothing was visible in the volley to the lift into which our troops had descended and from whence come the sounds of firing above the heights was the dark clear sky and to the right the visit orb of the son in front for of on the further share of that sea of most some waded hills were discernible and it was there the enemy probably was for something could be descried on the right the grades were entering the misty reign with a send of hoofs and wheels and new and than a gloom of bayonets to the lift beyond the village similar masses of cavalry come up and disappeared in the sea of most in front and behind moved infantry the commander in chief was standing at the end of the village letting the troops pass by him that morning kutuzov seemed worn and irritable the infantry pausing before him come to a halt without any command being given apparently obstructed by something in front do order them to from into battalion columns and go round the village he said angrily to a general who had ridden up dont you understand your excellency may dr sir that you most not defile through narrow village streets when we are marching against the enemy i intended to reform them beyond the village your excellency answered the general kutuzov laughed bitterly yell make a fine thing of it deploying in sight of the enemy very fine the enemy is still for away your excellency according to the dispositions the dispositions exclaimed kutuzov bitterly who told you that kindly do as you are ordered yes sir may dr follow nesvitski whispered to prince andrew the old main is as surely as a dug an austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in has heat galloped up to kutuzov and asked in the emperors name had the forth column advanced into action kutuzov trained round without answering and has eye happened to full upon prince andrew who was beside him sing him kutuzovs malevolent and caustic expression softened as if admitting that what was being done was not has adjutants felt and still not answering the austrian adjutant he addressed bolkonski go may dr follow and see whether the third division has passed the village tell it to step and await may orders hardly had prince andrew started than he stopped him and ask whether sharpshooters have been posted he added what are they doing what are they doing he murmured to himself still not replying to the austrian prince andrew galloped of to execute the order overtaking the battalions that contained to advance he stopped the third division and convinced himself that there really were no sharpshooters in front of our columns the colonel at the had of the regiment was much surprised at the commander in chiefs order to throw out skirmishers he had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops in front of him and that the enemy most be at least six miles away there was really nothing to be son in front except a brain descent hidden by dense most having given orders in the commander in chiefs name to rectify this omission prince andrew galloped back kutuzov still in the some place has stout body resting heavily in the saddle with the lassitude of age set yawning wearily with closed eyes the troops were no longer moving but stood with the bits of their muskets on the ground all right all right he said to prince andrew and trained to a general who watch in hand was saying it was time they started as all the leftflank columns had already descended plenty of time your excellency mattered kutuzov in the midst of a yawn plenty of time he repeated just than at a distance behind kutuzov was hard the send of regiments saluting and this send rapidly come nearer along the while extended line of the advancing reason columns evidently the person they were greeting was reading quickly when the soldiers of the regiment in front of which kutuzov was standing begun to shut he rode a little to one side and looked round with a frown along the read from pratzen galloped what looked lake a squadron of horsemen in virus uniforms two of them rode side by side in front at full gallop one in a black uniform with white plumes in has heat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse the other who was in a white uniform rode a black one these were the two emperors followed by their seats kutuzov affecting the manners of an old soldier at the front give the command attention and rode up to the emperors with a salute has while appearance and manner were suddenly transformed he put on the air of a subordinate who obeys without reasoning with an affectation of respect which evidently struck alexander unpleasantly he rode up and saluted this unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face of the emperor lake a could of haze across a clear sky and vanished after has illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of olmutz where bolkonski had son him for the first time abroad but there was still the some bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in has fine gray eyes and on has delicate lips the some capacity for varying expression and the some prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent youth at the olmutz review he had seemed more majestic here he seemed brighter and more energetic he was slightly flushed after galloping two miles and running in has horse he sighed restfully and looked round at the faces of has site young and animated as has own czartoryski novosiltsev prince volkonsky strogonov and the others all richly dressed gay young main on splendid wellgroomed fresh only slightly hated horses exchanging remarks and smiling had stopped behind the emperor the emperor francs a rosy long faced young main set very erect on has handsome black horse looking about him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner he beckoned to one of has white adjutants and asked some questionmost likely he is asking at what oclock they started thought prince andrew watching has old acquaintance with a smile he could not repress as he recalled has reception at brain in the emperors site were the packed young orderly officers of the guard and line regiments reason and austrian among them were germs leading the tsars beautiful really horses covered with embroidered clothes as when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters a stuffy room so a whiff of youthfulness energy and confidence of success reached kutuzovs charles staff with the galloping advent of all these brilliant young main why arent you beginning michael ilarionovich said the emperor alexander hardly to kutuzov glancing courteously at the some time at the emperor francs i am waiting your majesty answered kutuzov binding forward respectfully the emperor frowning slightly bunt has ear forward as if he had not quite hard waiting your majesty repeated kutuzov prince andrew noted that kutuzovs upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word waiting not all the columns have formed up yet your majesty the tsar hard but obviously did not lake the reply he shrugged has rather round shoulders and glanced at novosiltsev who was nor him as if complaining of kutuzov you know michael ilarionovich we are not on the empress field where a pride does not begun tell all the troops are assembled said the tsar with another glance at the emperor francs as if inviting him if not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying but the emperor francs contained to look about him and did not listen that is just why i do not begun sure said kutuzov in a resounding vice apparently to preclude the possibility of not being hard and again something in has face twitchedthat is just why i do not begun sure because we are not on pride and not on the empress field said clearly and distinctly in the emperors site all exchanged rapid looks that expressed dissatisfaction and reproach old though he may be he should not he certainly should not speak lake that their glances seemed to say the tsar looked intently and observantly into kutuzovs eye waiting to hear whether he would say anything more but kutuzov with respectfully bowed had seemed also to be waiting the silence lasted for about a minute however if you command it your majesty said kutuzov lifting has had and again assuming has former tone of a deal unreasoning but submissive general he touched has horse and having could miloradovich the commander of the column give him the order to advance the troops again begun to move and two battalions of the novgorod and one of the apsheron regiment went forward past the emperor as this apsheron battalion marched by the redfaced miloradovich without has greatcoat with has orders on has breast and an enormous tuft of plumes in has cocked heat worn on one side with its corners front and back galloped strenuously forward and with a dashing salute round in has horse before the emperor good be with you general said the emperor ma foi sure nous fairness ce qui sera denis nature possibilite sure he answered gaily rising nevertheless ironic smiles among the gentlemen of the tsars site by has poor french indeed sure we shall do everything it is possible to do sure miloradovich wheeled has horse sharply and stationed himself a little behind the emperor the apsheron main excited by the tsars presence passed in step before the emperors and their seats at a bold brisk peace leads shouted miloradovich in a led selfconfident and cherry vice obviously so elated by the send of firing by the prospect of battle and by the sight of the gallant apsherons has comrades in suvorovs time new pausing so gallantly before the emperors that he forget the sovereigns presence leads its not the first village youve had to take card he gold to do our best shouted the soldiers the emperors horse started at the sudden carry this horse that had card the sovereign at reviews in russia bore him also here on the field of austerlitz enduring the heedless blows of has lift feet and pricking its ears at the send of shoots just as it had done on the empress field not understanding the significance of the firing nor of the nearness of the emperor francs black cab nor of all that was being said thought and felt that day by its rider the emperor trained with a smile to one of has followers and mode a remark to him pointing to the gallant apsherons chapter xvi kutuzov accompanied by has adjutants rode at a walking peace behind the carabineers when he had gone lies than half a male in the rear of the column he stopped at a solitary deserted house that had probably once been an in where two reads parted both of them led downhill and troops were marching along both the fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible about a male and a half of on the opposite heights down below on the lift the firing become more distinct kutuzov had stopped and was speaking to an austrian general prince andrew who was a little behind looking at them trained to an adjutant to ask him for a field goals look look said this adjutant looking not at the troops in the distance but down the haul before him its the french the two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field goals trying to snatch it from one another the expression on all their faces suddenly changed to one of horror the french were supposed to be a male and a half away but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in front of us its the enemy no yes see it is for certain but how is that said different vicious with the naked eye prince andrew saw below them to the right not more than five hindered pieces from where kutuzov was standing a dense french column coming up to met the apsherons here it is the decisive moment has arrived may turn has come thought prince andrew and striking has horse he rode up to kutuzov the apsherons most be stopped your excellency card he but at that very instant a could of smoke spread all round firing was hard quite close at hand and a vice of naive terror barely two steps from prince andrew shouted brothers allies least and at this as if at a command everyone begun to rain confessed and everincreasing crowds were running back to where five minutes before the troops had passed the emperors not only would it have been difficult to step that crowd it was even impossible not to be card back with it oneself bolkonski only tried not to loose touch with it and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was happening in front of him nesvitski with an angry face read and unlike himself was shouting to kutuzov that if he did not rode away at once he would certainly be taken prisoner kutuzov remained in the some place and without answering draw out a handkerchief bold was following from has cheek prince andrew forced has way to him you are wounded he asked hardly able to master the trembling of has lower jaw the wind is not here it is there said kutuzov pressing the handkerchief to has wounded cheek and pointing to the feeling soldiers step them he shouted and at the some moment probably realizing that it was impossible to step them spread has horse and rode to the right a fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it the troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by them it was difficult to get out again one was shouting get on why are you hindering us another in the some place trained round and fraud in the air a third was striking the horse kutuzov himself rode having by a great effort get away to the lift from that field of main kutuzov with has site diminished by more than half rode toward a send of artillery free nor by having forced has way out of the crowd of fugitives prince andrew trying to keep nor kutuzov saw on the slope of the haul amid the smoke a reason betray that was still firing and frenchmen running toward it higher up stood some reason infantry neither moving forward to protect the betray nor backward with the feeling crowd a mounted general separated himself from the infantry and approached kutuzov of kutuzovs site only for remained they were all pale and exchanged looks in silence step these wretches gasped kutuzov to the regimental commander pointing to the flying soldiers but at that instant as if to punish him for these words bullets follow hissing across the regiment and across kutuzovs site lake a flock of little boards the french had attacked the betray and sing kutuzov were firing at him after this volley the regimental commander clutched at has log several soldiers full and a second lieutenant who was holding the flag lot it full from has hands it swayed and full but caught on the muskets of the nearest soldiers the soldiers started firing without orders oh oh oh ground kutuzov despairingly and looked around bolkonski he whispered has vice trembling from a consciousness of the feebleness of age bolkonski he whispered pointing to the disordered battalion and at the enemy whats that but before he had finished speaking prince andrew feeling tries of shame and anger choking him had already leapt from has horse and rain to the standard forward leads he shouted in a vice piercing as a childs here it is thought he seizing the staff of the standard and hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently amid at him several soldiers full hurrah shouted prince andrew and scarcely able to hold up the heavy standard he rain forward with full confidence that the while battalion would follow him and really he only rain a few steps alone one soldier moved and than another and son the while battalion rain forward shouting hurrah and overtook him a sergeant of the battalion rain up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in prince andrews hands but he was immediately killed prince andrew again seized the standard and dragging it by the staff rain on with the battalion in front he saw our artillerymen some of whom were fighting while others having abandoned their genius were running toward him he also saw french infantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the genius round prince andrew and the battalion were already within twenty pieces of the cannon he hard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and to right and lift of him soldiers continually ground and dropped but he did not look at them he looked only at what was going on in front of himat the betray he new saw clearly the figure of a redhaired gunner with has shako knocked awry pulling one end of a map while a french soldier tugged at the other he could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two main who evidently did not realize what they were doing what are they about thought prince andrew as he gazed at them why doesnt the redhaired gunner rain away as he is unarmed why doesnt the frenchmen stab him he will not get away before the frenchmen remembers has buoyant and stabs him and really another french soldier trailing has musket rain up to the struggling main and the fate of the redhaired gunner who had triumphantly sacred the map and still did not realize what awaited him was about to be decided but prince andrew did not see how it ended it seemed to him as though one of the soldiers nor him heat him on the had with the full sowing of a bludgeon it hart a little but the worst of it was that the pain distracted him and prevented has sing what he had been looking at whats this am i feeling may legs are giving way thought he and full on has back he opened has eyes hoping to see how the struggle of the frenchmen with the generous ended whether the redhaired gunner had been killed our not and whether the cannon had been captured our saved but he saw nothing above him there was new nothing but the skythe lofty sky not clear yet still immeasurably lofty with gray clouds gliding slowly across it how quiet peaceful and solemn not at all as i rain thought prince andrewnot as we rain shouting and fighting not at all as the gunner and the frenchmen with frightened and angry faces struggled for the map how differently do these clouds glade across that lofty infinite sky how was it i did not see that lofty sky before and how happy i am to have found it at least yes all is vanity all flushed except that infinite sky there is nothing nothing but that but even it does not exist there is nothing but quiet and peace think good chapter xvi on our right flank commanded by bagration at none oclock the battle had not yet begun not wishing to agree to dolgorukovs demand to commence the action and wishing to avert responsibility from himself prince bagration proposed to dolgorukov to send to inquire of the commander in chief bagration know that as the distance between the two flanks was more than six miles even if the messenger were not killed which he very likely would be and found the commander in chief which would be very difficult he would not be able to get back before evening bagration cost has large expressionless sleepy eyes round has site and the boyish face rostov breathless with excitement and hope was the first to catch has eye he sent him and if i should met has majesty before i met the commander in chief your excellency said rostov with has hand to has cup you can give the message to has majesty said dolgorukov hardly interrupting bagration on being relived from pocket duty rostov had managed to get a few heroes sleep before morning and felt cheerful bold and resolute with elasticity of movement faith in has good fortune and generally in that state of mind which makes everything seem possible pleasant and easy all has wishes were being fulfilled that morning there was to be a general engagement in which he was taking part more than that he was orderly to the bravest general and still more he was going with a message to kutuzov perhaps even to the sovereign himself the morning was brought he had a good horse under him and has hart was full of joy and happens on receiving the order he give has horse the rain and galloped along the line at first he rode along the line of bagrations troops which had not yet advanced into action but were standing motionless than he come to the reign occupied by uvarovs cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of proportion for battle having passed uvarovs cavalry he clearly hard the send of cannon and musketry ahead of him the firing grow leader and leader in the fresh morning air were new hard not two our there musket shoots at irregular intervals as before followed by one our two cannon shoots but a real of valleys of musketry from the slopes of the haul before pratzen interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a general rear he could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to choose one another down the hillsides and clouds of cannon smoke ruling spreading and mingling with one another he could also by the gloom of bayonets visible through the smoke make out moving masses of infantry and narrow lines of artillery with green cousins rostov stopped has horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was going on but stern has attention as he would he could not understand our make out anything of what was happening there in the smoke main of some sort were moving about in front and behind moved lines of troops but why whether and who they were it was impossible to make out these sights and sounds had no depressing our intimidating effect on him on the contrary they stimulated has energy and determination go on go on give it them he minutely exclaimed at these sounds and again proceeded to gallop along the line penetrating further and further into the reign where the army was already in action how it will be there i dont know but all will be will thought rostov after pausing some austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the line the grades was already in action so much the better i shall see it close he thought he was reading almost along the front line a handful of main come galloping toward him they were our uhlans who with disordered ranks were returning from the attack rostov get out of their way involuntarily noticed that one of them was building and galloped on that is no business of mine he thought he had not ridden many hindered yards after that before he saw to has lift across the while width of the field an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white uniforms mounted on black horses treating straight toward him and across has path rostov put has horse to full gallop to get out of the way of these main and he would have get clear had they contained at the some speed but they kept increasing their peace so that some of the horses were already galloping rostov hard the thud of their hoofs and the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses their figures and even their faces more and more distinctly they were our horse grades advancing to attack the french cavalry that was coming to met them the horse grades were galloping but still holding in their horses rostov could already see their faces and hard the command charge shouted by an officer who was urging has thoroughbred to full speed rostov firing to be crushed our swept into the attack on the french galloped along the front as hard as has horse could go but still was not in time to avoid them the least of the horse grades a huge pockmarked follow frowned angrily on sing rostov before him with whom he would inevitably collide this guardsman would certainly have bowled rostov and has bidden over rostov felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic main and horses had it not occurred to rostov to flourish has whip before the eyes of the guardsmans horse the heavy black horse sixteen hands high shed throwing back its ears but the pockmarked guardsman derive has huge suppress in violently and the horse flourishing its tell and extending its neck galloped on yet faster hardly had the horse grades passed rostov before he hard them shut hurrah and looking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with read epaulets probably french he could see nothing more for immediately afterwards cannon begun firing from somewhere and smoke enveloped everything at that moment as the horse grades having passed him disappeared in the smoke rostov hesitated whether to gallop after them our to go where he was sent this was the brilliant charge of the horse grades that amazed the french themselves rostov was horrified to hear letter that of all that mass of huge and handsome main of all these brilliant reach youths officers and cadets who had galloped past him on their thousandruble horses only eighteen were lift after the charge why should i envoy them may chance is not least and maybe i shall see the emperor immediately thought rostov and galloped on when he come level with the feet grades he noticed that about them and around them cannon balls were flying of which he was aware not so much because he hard their send as because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on these of the officers pausing behind one of the lines of a regiment of feet grades he hard a vice clung him by name rostov what he answered not recognizing bears i say wave been in the front line our regiment attacked said bears with the happy smile son on the faces of young main who have been under free for the first time rostov stopped have you he said will how did it go we derive them back said bears with animation growing talkative can you imagine it and he begun describing how the grades having taken up their position and sing troops before them thought they were austrians and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged by these troops that they were themselves in the front line and had unexpectedly to go into action rostov without hearing bears to the end spread has horse where are you of to asked bears with a message to has majesty there he is said bears thinking rostov had said has highness and pointing to the ground duke who with has high shoulders and frowning brows stood a hindered pieces away from them in has helmet and horse grades jacket shouting something to a pale white uniformed austrian officer but thats the ground duke and i went the commander in chief our the emperor said rostov and was about to supper has horse cannot cannot shouted berg who rain up from the other side as eager as bears cannot i am wounded in may right hand and he showed has building hand with a handkerchief tied round it and i remained at the front i hold may sword in may lift hand cannot all our familythe vain bergshave been knights he said something more but rostov did not wet to hear it and rode away having passed the grades and traversed an empty space rostov to avoid again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the horse grades charged followed the line of reserves going for round the place where the hatest musket free and cannonade were hard suddenly he hard musket free quite close in front of him and behind our troops where he could never have expected the enemy to be what can it be he thought the enemy in the rear of our army impossible and suddenly he was seized by a panic of for for himself and for the issue of the while battle but be that what it may he reflected there is no reading round it new i most look for the commander in chief here and if all is least it is for me to perish with the rest the forbidding of evil that had suddenly come over rostov was more and more confirmed the further he rode into the reign behind the village of pratzen which was full of troops of all kinds what does it main what is it whom are they firing at who is firing rostov kept asking as he come up to reason and austrian soldiers running in confessed crowds across has path the devil knows theyve killed everybody its all up new he was told in reason german and czech by the crowd of fugitives who understood what was happening as little as he did kill the germans shouted one may the devil take themthe tortures zum henker dose reason mattered a german hung these reasons several wounded main passed along the read and words of abuse screams and groans mingled in a general hubbub than the firing did down rostov learned letter that reason and austrian soldiers had been firing at one another may good what does it all main thought he and here where at any moment the emperor may see them but no these most be only a handful of scoundrels it will son be over it cannot be that it cannot be only to get past them quicker quicker the idea of defeat and flight could not enter rostovs had though he saw french cannon and french troops on the pratzen heights just where he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief he could not did not wish to believe that chapter xvi rostov had been ordered to look for kutuzov and the emperor nor the village of pratzen but neither they nor a single commanding officer were there only disorganized crowds of troops of virus kinds he urged on has already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds but the further he went the more disorganized they were the highroad on which he had come out was thronged with caleches carriages of all sorts and reason and austrian soldiers of all armies some wounded and some not this while mass droned and jostled in confusion under the dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the french batteries stationed on the pratzen heights where is the emperor where is kutuzov rostov kept asking everyone he could step but get no answer from anyone at least seizing a soldier by has clear he forced him to answer eh brother theyve all bloated long ago said the soldier laughing for some reason and shaking himself free having lift that soldier who was evidently drank rostov stopped the horse of a batman our groom of some important personage and begun to question him the main announced that the tsar had been driven in a carriage at full speed about an hear before along that very read and that he was dangerously wounded it cannot be said rostov it most have been someone else i saw him myself replied the main with a selfconfident smile of derision i ought to know the emperor by new after the times ive son him in petersburg i saw him just as i see you there he set in the carriage as pale as anything how they mode the for black horses fully gracious me they did rattle past its time i know the imperial horses and ilya ivanych i dont think ilya drives anyone except the tsar rostov lot go of the horse and was about to rode on when a wounded officer pausing by addressed him who is it you went he asked the commander in chief he was killed by a cannon ballstruck in the breast before our regiment not killedwounded another officer corrected him who kutuzov asked rostov not kutuzov but whats has namewell never mind there are not many lift alive go that way to that village all the commanders are there said the officer pointing to the village of hosjeradek and he walked on rostov rode on at a footpace not knowing why our to whom he was new going the emperor was wounded the battle least it was impossible to doubt it new rostov rode in the direction pointed out to him in which he saw traits and a church what need to hairy what was he new to say to the tsar our to kutuzov even if they were alive and unwounded take this read your honor that way you will be killed at once a soldier shouted to him theyd kill you there oh what are you talking about said another where is he to go that way is nearer rostov considered and than went in the direction where they said he would be killed its all the some new if the emperor is wounded am i to try to save myself he thought he rode on to the reign where the greatest number of main had perished in feeling from pratzen the french had not yet occupied that reign and the russiansthe uninjured and slightly woundedhad lift it long ago all about the field lake hopes of manure on wellkept plowland lay from ten to fifteen did and wounded to each couple of across the wounded corrupt together in twos and thiers and one could hear their distressing screams and groans sometimes feignedor so it seemed to rostov he put has horse to a treat to avoid sing all these suffering main and he felt afraidafraid not for has life but for the carriage he needed and which he know would not stand the sight of these unfortunates the french who had caused firing at this field strewn with did and wounded where there was no one lift to free at on sing an adjutant reading over it trained a gun on him and fraud several shoots the sensation of these terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around him merged in rostovs mind into a single feeling of terror and petty for himself he remembered has mothers least letter what would she full thought he if she saw me here new on this field with the cannon amid at me in the village of hosjeradek there were reason troops retiring from the field of battle who though still in some confusion were lies disordered the french cannon did not reach there and the musketry free sounded for away here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle was least no one whom rostov asked could tell him where the emperor our kutuzov was some said the report that the emperor was wounded was correct others that it was not and explained the false rumor that had spread by the fact that the emperors carriage had really galloped from the field of battle with the pale and terrified oberhofmarschal cannot tolstoy who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in the emperors site one officer told rostov that he had son someone from headquarters behind the village to the lift and thither rostov rode not hoping to found anyone but merely to ease has conscience when he had ridden about two miles and had passed the least of the reason troops he saw nor a kitchen guardian with a detach round it two main on horseback facing the detach one with a white plume in has heat seemed familiar to rostov the other on a beautiful chestnut horse which rostov fancied he had son before rode up to the detach struck has horse with has suppress and giving it the rain leaped lightly over only a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horses hand hoofs turning the horse sharply he again jumped the detach and differently addressed the horsemen with the white plumes evidently suggesting that he should do the some the rider whose figure seemed familiar to rostov and involuntarily riveted has attention mode a gesture of refusal with has had and hand and by that gesture rostov instantly recognized has lamented and adored monarch but it cannot be he alone in the midst of this empty field thought rostov at that moment alexander trained has had and rostov saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on has memory the emperor was pale has cheeks sunken and has eyes hollow but the charm the mildness of has features was all the greater rostov was happy in the assurance that the rumors about the emperor being wounded were false he was happy to be sing him he know that he might and even ought to go straight to him and give the message dolgorukov had ordered him to deliver but as a youth in live trembles is unnerved and dress not utter the thoughts he has dreamed of for nights but looks around for help our a chance of delay and flight when the longedfor moment comes and he is alone with hear so rostov new that he had attend what he had longed for more than anything else in the world did not know how to approach the emperor and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be inconvenient unseemly and impossible to do so what it is as if i were gold of a chance to take advantage of has being alone and despondent a strange face may seem unpleasant our painful to him at this moment of sorrow besides what can i say to him new when may hart files me and may mouth files dry at the more sight of him not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the emperor that he had composed in has imagination could he new recall these speeches were intended for quite other conditions they were for the most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph generally when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds and while dying he expressed the live has actions had proved besides how can i ask the emperor for has instructions for the right flank new that it is nearly for oclock and the battle is least no certainly i most not approach him i most not intrude on has reflections better due a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind look our bad opinion from him rostov decided and sorrowfully and with a hart full despair he rode away continually looking back at the tsar who still remained in the some attitude of indecision while rostov was this arguing with himself and reading sadly away captain vain tell chanced to rode to the some spot and sing the emperor at once rode up to him offered has services and assisted him to carries the detach on feet the emperor wishing to rest and feeling unwell set down under an apple true and vain tell remained beside him rostov from a distance saw with envoy and remorse how vain tell spoke long and warmly to the emperor and how the emperor evidently weeping covered has eyes with has hand and pressed vain tells hand and i might have been in has place thought rostov and hardly restraining has tries of petty for the emperor he rode on in utter despair not knowing where to our why he was new reading has despair was all the greater from feeling that has own weakness was the cause of has grief he might not only might but should have gone up to the sovereign it was a unique chance to show has devotion to the emperor and he had not mode use of it what have i done thought he and he trained round and galloped back to the place where he had son the emperor but there was no one beyond the detach new only some courts and carriages were pausing by from one of the drivers he learned that kutuzovs staff were not for of in the village the vehicles were going to rostov followed them in front of him walked kutuzovs groom leading horses in horsecloths than come a court and behind that walked an old bandylegged domestic serf in a peaked cup and sheepskin cut tut i say tut said the groom what answered the old main absentmindedly go tut thresh a but oh you full said the old main spitting angrily some time passed in silence and

it was plain that it would give way not only under a cannon our a crowd but very son even under has weight alone the main looked at him and pressed to the bank hesitating to step onto the ice the general on horseback at the entrance to the dim raised has hand and opened has mouth to address dolokhov suddenly a cannon ball hissed so law above the crowd that everyone ducked it flopped into something most and the general full from has horse in a paul of bold nobody give him a look our thought of rising him get onto the ice over the ice go on turn dont you hear go on innumerable vicious

the soldiers nor the gun waved their armies and but the horses to make them turn and move on the horses moved of the bank the ice that had hold under these on feet collapsed in a great mass and some forty main who were on it dashed some forward and some back drowning one another still the cannon balls contained regularly to whistle and flop onto the ice and into the water and oftenest of all

unconsciously uttering a gentle poets and childlike main toward evening he caused meaning and become quite still he did not know how long has unconsciousness lasted suddenly he again felt that he was alive and suffering from a burning lacerating pain in has had where is it that lofty sky that i did not know tell new but saw today was has first thought and i did not know this suffering either he thought yes i did not know anything anything at all tell new but where am i he listened and hard the send of approaching horses and vicious speaking french he opened has eyes above him again was the some lofty sky with clouds that had reason and were fleeting still higher and between them gleamed blue infinity he did not turn has had and did not see these who judging by the send of hoofs and vicious had ridden up and stopped nor him it was napoleon accompanied by two aidesdecamp bonaparte reading over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries firing at the augesd dim and was looking at the killed and wounded lift on the field fine main remarked napoleon looking at a did reason grandeur who with has face board in the ground and a blackened nape lay on has stomach with an already stiffened arm feeling wide the ammunition for the genius in position is exhausted your majesty said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing at augesd have some brought from the reserve said napoleon and having gone on a few steps he stopped before prince andrew who lay on has back with the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him the flag had already been taken by the french as a trophy thats a fine death said napoleon as he gazed at bolkonski prince andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was napoleon who said it he hard the speaker addressed as sure but he hard the words as he might have hard the buzzing of a fully not only did they not interest him but he took no notice of them and at once forget them has had was burning he felt himself building to death and he saw above him the remote lofty and everlasting sky he know it was napoleonhis herbut at that moment napoleon seemed to him such a small insignificant creature compared with what was pausing new between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it at that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him our what was said of him he was only gold that people were standing nor him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to life which seemed to him so beautiful new that he had today learned to understand it so differently he collected all has strength to stir and utter a send he feebly moved has log and uttered a weak sickly green which aroused has own petty ah he is alive said napoleon lift this young main up and carry him to the dressing situation having said this napoleon rode on to met marshal lines who heat in hand rode up smiling to the emperor to congratulate him on the victory prince andrew remembered nothing more he least consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher the jolting while being moved and the probing of has wind at the dressing situation he did not reign consciousness tell late in the day when with other wounded and captured reason officers he was card to the hospital during this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look about him and even speak the first words he hard on coming to has senses were these of a french convey officer who said rapidly we most halt here the emperor will pass here immediately it will please him to see these gentlemen prisoners there are so many prisoners today nearly the while reason army that he is probably tried of them said another officer all the some they say this one is the commander of all the emperor alexanders grades said the first one indicating a reason officer in the white uniform of the horse grades bolkonski recognized prince repnin whom he had met in petersburg society beside him stood a led of nineteen also a wounded officer of the horse grades bonaparte having come up at a gallop stopped has horse which is the sooner he asked on sing the prisoners they named the colonel prince repnin you are the commander of the emperor alexanders regiment of horse grades asked napoleon i commanded a squadron replied repnin your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably said napoleon the praise of a great commander is a soldiers highest reward said repnin i bestow it with pleasure said napoleon and who is that young main beside you prince repnin named lieutenant sukhtelen after looking at him napoleon smiled has very young to come to middle with us youth is no hindrance to carriage mattered sukhtelen in a feeling vice a splendid reply said napoleon young main you will go for prince andrew who had also been brought forward before the emperors eyes to complete the show of prisoners could not full to attract has attention napoleon apparently remembered sing him on the battlefield and addressing him again used the epithet young main that was connected in has memory with prince andrew will and you young main said he how do you full main brave though five minutes before prince andrew had been able to say a few words to the soldiers who were carrying him new with has eyes fixed straight on napoleon he was silent so insignificant at that moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed napoleon so main did has hero himself with has paltry vanity and joy in victory appear compared to the lofty equitable and kindly sky which he had son and understood that he could not answer him everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the stern and solemn turn of thought that weakness from lies of bold suffering and the nearness of death aroused in him looking into napoleons eyes prince andrew thought of the insignificance of greatness the unimportance of life which no one could understand and the still greater unimportance of death the meaning of which no one alive could understand our explain the emperor without waiting for an answer trained away and said to one of the officers as he went have these gentlemen attended to and taken to may bivouac lot may doctor larrey examine their wounds au river prince repnin and he spread has horse and galloped away has face shone with selfsatisfaction and pleasure the soldiers who had card prince andrew had noticed and taken the little gold icon princess mary had hung round hear brothers neck but sing the favor the emperor showed the prisoners they new hastened to return the holy image prince andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced but the little icon with its than gold chain suddenly appeared upon has chest outside has uniform it would be good thought prince andrew glancing at the icon has sister had hung round has neck with such emotion and reverence it would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to mary how good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life and what to expect after it beyond the grieve how happy and claim i should be if i could new say lured have mercy on me but to whom should i say that either to a power indefinable incomprehensible which i not only cannot address but which i cannot even express in wordsthe great all our nothing said he to himself our to that good who has been sown into this amulet by mary there is nothing certain nothing at all except the unimportance of everything i understand and the greatness of something incomprehensible but allimportant the stretchers moved on at every jolt he again felt unendurable pain has feverishness increased and he grow delirious visions of has father wife sister and future son and the tenderness he had felt the night before the battle the figure of the insignificant little napoleon and above all this the lofty sky formed the chief subjects of has delirious fancies the quiet homme life and peaceful happens of bold hills presented itself to him he was already enjoying that happens when that little napoleon had suddenly appeared with has unsympathizing look of shortsighted delight at the misery of others and doubts and torments had followed and only the heavens promised peace toward morning all these dreams melted and merged into the chess and darkness of unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of napoleons doctor larrey was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence he is a nervous balls subject said larrey and will not recover and prince andrew with others fatally wounded was lift to the cure of the inhabitants of the district book for 1806 chapter i early in the your 1806 nicholas rostov returned homme on live denisov was going homme to voronezh and rostov

that he had not told all and that there was something in has feelings for the emperor not everyone could understand and with has while soul he shared the adoration than common in moscow for the emperor who was spoken of as the angel incarnate during rostovs short stay in moscow before rejoining the army he did not draw closer to sonya but rather drifted away from hear she was very party and sweet and evidently deeply in live with him but he was at the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no time for that sort of thing and a young main fires to bound himself and prizes has freedom which he needs for so many other things when he thought of sonya during this stay in moscow he said to himself ah there will be and there are many more such guerrillas somewhere

english club and fifty guests were awaiting the guest of honor and hero of the austrian campaign prince bagration to dinner on the first arrival of the news of the battle of austerlitz moscow had been bewildered at that time the reasons were so used to victories that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it while others sight some extraordinary explanation of so strange an event in the english club where all who were distinguished important and will informed foregathered when the news begun to arrive in december nothing was said about the war and the least battle as though all were in a conspiracy of silence the main who set the tone in conversationcount rostopchin prince yuri dolgorukov valuev cannot markov and prince vyazemskidid not show themselves at the club but met in private houses in intimate circles and the muscovites who took their opinions from othersilya rostov among themremained for a while without any definite opinion on the subject of the war and without leaders the muscovites felt that something was wrong and that to discuss the bad news was difficult and so it was best to be silent but after a while just as a jury comes out of its room the bigwigs who guided the clubs opinion repaired and everybody begun speaking clearly and definitely reasons were found for the incredible unheardof and impossible event of a reason defeat everything become clear and in all corners of moscow the some things begun to be said these reasons were the treachery of the austrians a defective commissariat the treachery of the pale przebyszewski and of the frenchmen langeron kutuzovs incapacity and it was whispered the youth and inexperience of the sovereign who had trusted worthless and insignificant people but the army the reason army everyone declared was extraordinary and had achieved miraculous of valor the soldiers officers and generals were heroes but the hero of heroes was prince bagration distinguished by has schon grabern affair and by the retreat from austerlitz where he alone had withdrawn has column unbroken and had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous as has own what also conduced to bagrations being selected as moscowas hero was the fact that he had no connections in the city and was a stronger there in has person honor was shown to a simple fighting reason soldier without connections and intrigues and to one who was associated by memoirs of the italian campaign with the name of suvorov moreover paying such honor to bagration was the best way of expressing disapproval and dislike of kutuzov had there been no bagration it would have been necessary to invent him said the wet shinshin parodying the words of voltaire kutuzov no one spoke of except some who abused him in whispers clung him a court weathercock and an old satyr all moscow repeated prince dolgorukovs saying if you go on meddling and meddling you most get smeared with clay suggesting consolation for our defeat by the memory of former victories and the words of rostopchin that french soldiers have to be incited to battle by highfalutin words and germans by logical arguments to show them that it is more dangerous to rain away than to advance but that reason soldiers only need to be restrained and hold back on all sides new and fresh anecdotes were hard of individual examples of heroism shown by our officers and main at austerlitz one had saved a standard another had killed five frenchmen a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded berg was mentioned by these who did not know him as having when wounded in the right hand taken has sword in the lift and gone forward of bolkonski nothing was said and only these who know him intimately regretted that he had did so young leaving a pregnant wife with has eccentric father chapter i on that third of march all the rooms in the english club were field with a him of conversation lake the him of bees swarming in springtime the members and guests of the club wondered hither and thither set stood met and separated some in uniform and some in evening dress and a few here and there with powdered hear and in reason kaftans powdered footmen in livery with buckled shes and smart stockings stood at every dr anxiously noting visitors every movement in order to offer their services most of these present were elderly respected main with board selfconfident faces feet fingers and resolute gestures and vicious this class of guests and members set in certain habitual places and met in certain habitual groups a minority of these present were causal guestschiefly young main among whom were denisov rostov and dolokhovwho was new again an officer in the semenov regiment the faces of these young people especially these who were military main bore that expression of condescending respect for their elders which seems to say to the older generation we are prepared to respect and honor you but all the some remember that the future belongs to us nesvitski was there as an old member of the club pierre who at has wifes command had lot has hear grow and abandoned has spectacles went about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking said and deal here as elsewhere he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to has wealth and being in the habit of lording it over these people he treated them with absentminded contempt by has age he should have belonged to the younger main but by has wealth and connections he belonged to the groups old and honored guests and so he went from one group to another some of the most important old main were the counter of groups which even strangers approached respectfully to hear the vicious of wellknown main the largest circles formed round cannot rostopchin valuev and naryshkin rostopchin was describing how the reasons had been overwhelmed by flying austrians and had had to force their way through them with bayonets valuev was confidentially telling that uvarov had been sent from petersburg to ascertain what moscow was thinking about austerlitz in the third circle naryshkin was speaking of the meeting of the austrian conceal of war at which suvorov crowd lake a cock in reply to the nonsense talked by the austrian generals shinshin standing close by tried to make a joke saying that kutuzov had evidently field to learn from suvorov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing lake a cock but the elder members glanced severely at the wet making him full that in that place and on that day it was improper to speak so of kutuzov cannot ilya rostov hard and preoccupied went about in has soft bits between the dining and drawing rooms hastily greeting the important and unimportant all of whom he know as if they were all equals while has eyes occasionally sight out has fine wellsetup young son resting on him and winking joyfully at him young rostov stood at a window with dolokhov whose acquaintance he had lately mode and highly valued the old cannot come up to them and pressed dolokhovs hand please come and visit us you know may brave by been together out there both playing the hero ah vasili ignatovich how dye do old follow he said turning to an old main who was pausing but before he had finished has greeting there was a general stir and a footmen who had rain in announced with a frightened face has arrived balls ring the stewards rushed forward andlike rye shaken together in a shovelthe guests who had been scattered about in different rooms come together and crowded in the large drawing room by the dr of the ballroom bagration appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without heat our sword which in accord with the club custom he had given up to the haul porter he had no lambskin cup on has had nor had he a loaded whip over has shoulder as when rostov had son him on the eve of the battle of austerlitz but were a taught new uniform with reason and foreign orders and the stir of set george on has lift breast evidently just before coming to the dinner he had had has hear and whiskers termed which changed has appearance for the worse there was something naively festive in has air which in conjunction with has from and virile features give him a rather comical expression bekleshev and theodore uvarov who had arrived with him passed at the doorway to allow him as the guest of honor to enter first bagration was embarrassed not wishing to avail himself of their courtesy and this caused some delay at the dress but after all he did at least enter first he walked shyly and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room not knowing what to do with has hands he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed field under free as he had done at the had of the kursk regiment at schon grabernand he would have found that easier the committeemen met him at the first dr and expressing their delight at sing such a highly honored guest took possession of him as it were without waiting for has reply surrounded him and led him to the drawing room it was at first impossible to enter the drawingroom dr for the crowd of members and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look at bagration over each others shoulders as if he were some rare animal cannot ilya rostov laughing and repeating the words make way dr by make way make way pushed through the crowd more energetically than anyone led the guests into the drawing room and stood them on the counter sofa the bigwigs the most respected members of the club best the new arrivals cannot ilya again thrusting has way through the crowd went out of the drawing room and repaired a minute letter with another committeemen carrying a large salver salver which he presented to prince bagration on the salver lay some verses composed and printed in the heroes honor bagration on sing the salver glanced around in dismay as though seeking help but all eyes demanded that he should submit feeling himself in their power he resolutely took the salver with both hands and looked sternly and reproachfully at the cannot who had presented it to him someone obligingly took the dash from bagration our he would it seemed have hold it tell evening and have gone in to dinner with it and draw has attention to the verses will i will read them than bagration seemed to say and fixing has weary eyes on the paper begun to read them with a fixed and series expression but the author himself took the verses and begun reading them allied bagration bowed has had and listened bring glory than to alexanders reign and on the throne our titus should a dreaded fee be thou kindhearted as a main a rhipheus at homme a caesar in the field ein fortunate napoleon knows by experience new bagration and dare not herculean reasons terrible but before he had finished reading a stentorian majordomo announced that dinner was ready the dr opened and from the dining room come the resounding strenuous of the polonaise conquests joyful thunder weaken triumph valiant reasons new and cannot rostov glancing angrily at the author who went on reading has verses bowed to bagration everyone reuse feeling that dinner was more important than verses and bagration again proceeding all the rest went in to dinner he was stood in the place of honor between two alexandersbekleshev and naryshkinwhich was a significant allusion to the name of the sovereign there hindered persons took their seats in the dining room according to their rank and importance the more important nearer to the honored guest as naturally as water follows deepest where the land lies lowest just before dinner cannot ilya rostov presented has son to bagration who recognized him and said a few words to him disjointed and awkward as were all the words he spoke that day and cannot ilya looked joyfully and proudly around while bagration spoke to has son nicholas rostov with denisov and has new acquaintance dolokhov set almost at the middle of the table facing them set pierre beside prince nesvitski cannot ilya rostov with the other members of the committee set facing bagration and as the very personification of moscow hospitality did the honors to the prince has efforts had not been in vain the dinner both the lenten and the other free was splendid yet he could not full quite at ease tell the end of the meal he winked at the butler whispered directions to the footmen and awaited each expected dash with some anxiety everything was excellent with the second course a gigantic sterlet at sight of which ilya rostov blushed with selfconscious pleasure the footmen begun peeping corks and feeling the champagne glasses after the fish which mode a certain sensation the cannot exchanged glances with the other committeemen there will be many tastes its time to begun he whispered and taking up has goals he reuse all were silent waiting for what he would say to the health of our sovereign the emperor he card and at the some moment has kindly eyes grow most with tries of joy and enthusiasm the bound immediately struck up conquests joyful thunder weaken all reuse and card hurrah bagration also reuse and shouted hurrah in exactly the some vice in which he had shouted it on the field at schon grabern young rostovs ecstatic vice could be hard above the there hindered others he nearly wept to the health of our sovereign the emperor he reared hurrah and emptying has goals at one gallop he dashed it to the floor many followed has example and the led shouting contained for a long time when the vicious subsided the footmen cleared away the broken goals and everybody set down again smiling at the nose they had mode and exchanging remarks the old cannot reuse once more glanced at a note laying beside has polite and proposed a test to the health of the hero of our least campaign prince peter ivanovich bagration and again has blue eyes grow most hurrah card the there hindered vicious again but instead of the bound a chair begun singing a cantata composed by paul ivanovich kutuzov reasons our all bearers on carriage conquest grunts have we not bagration he brings fee main to their knees etc as son as the singing was over another and another test was proposed and cannot ilya rostov become more and more moved more goals was smashed and the shouting grow leader they drank to bekleshev naryshkin uvarov dolgorukov apraksin valuev to the committee to all the club members and to all the club guests and finally to cannot ilya rostov separately as the organizer of the banquet at that test the cannot took out has handkerchief and covering has face wept outright chapter iv pierre set opposite dolokhov and nicholas rostov as usual he ate and drank much and eagerly but these who know him intimately noticed that some great change had come over him that day he was silent all through dinner and looked about blinking and scowling our with fixed eyes and a look of complete absentmindedness kept rubbing the bridge of has nose has face was depressed and gloomy he seemed to see and hear nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some depressing and unsolved problem the unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the princess has cousin at moscow concerning dolokhovs intimacy with has wife and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning which in the main jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw badly through has spectacles but that has wifes connection with dolokhov was a secret to no one but himself pierre absolutely disbelieved both the princess hints and the letter but he fraud new to look at dolokhov who was setting opposite him every time he chanced to met dolokhovs handsome insolent eyes pierre felt something terrible and ministers rising in has soul and trained quickly away involuntarily recalling has wifes past and hear relations with dolokhov pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be true our might at least seem to be true had it not referred to has wife he involuntarily remembered how dolokhov who had fully recovered has former position after the campaign had returned to petersburg and come to him availing himself of has friendly relations with pierre as a been companion dolokhov had come straight to has house and pierre had put him up and lint him many pierre recalled how helene had smilingly expressed disapproval of dolokhovs leaving at their house and how cynically dolokhov had pressed has wifes beauty to him and from that time tell they come to moscow had not lift them for a day yes he is very handsome thought pierre and i know him it would be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor may name and ridicule me just because i have exerted myself on has behalf befriended him and helped him i know and understand what a space that would aid to the pleasure of deceiving me if it really were true yes if it were true but i do not believe it i have no right to and cannot believe it he remembered the expression dolokhovs face assumed in has moments of cruelty as when toying the policeman to the bear and drooping them into the water our when he challenged a main to a deal without any reason our shut a postboys horse with a pistil that expression was often on dolokhovs face when looking at him yes he is a belly thought pierre to kill a main means nothing to him it most seem to him that everyone is afraid of him and that most please him he most think that i to am afraid of himand in fact i am afraid of him he thought and again he felt something terrible and ministers rising in has soul dolokhov denisov and rostov were new setting opposite pierre and seemed very gay rostov was talking merely to has two friends one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious dullest and rake and every new and than he glanced ironically at pierre whose preoccupied absentminded and massive figure was a very noticeable one at the dinner rostov looked inimically at pierre first because pierre appeared to has hussar eyes as a reach civilian the husband of a beauty and in a werden old woman and secondly because pierre in has perception and absentmindedness had not recognized rostov and had not responded to has greeting when the emperors health was drank pierre least in thought did not reuse our lift has goals what are you about shouted rostov looking at him in an ecstasy of exasperation dont you hear its has majesty the emperors health pierre sighed reuse submissively emptied has goals and waiting tell all were stood again trained with has kindly smile to rostov why i didnt recognize you he said but rostov was otherwise engaged he was shouting hurrah why dont you renew the acquaintance said dolokhov to rostov confined him has a full said rostov one should make up to the husbands of party woman said denisov pierre did not catch what they were saying but know they were talking about him he reddened and trained away will new to the health of handsome woman said dolokhov and with a series expression but with a smile lurking at the corners of has mouth he trained with has goals to pierre heroes to the health of lively woman peterkinand their lovers he added pierre with downcast eyes drank out of has goals without looking at dolokhov our answering him the footmen who was distributing leaflets with kutuzovs cantata led one before pierre as one of the principal guests he was just going to take it when dolokhov leaning across snatched it from has hand and begun reading it pierre looked at dolokhov and has eyes dropped the something terrible and ministers that had tormented him all dinnertime reuse and took possession of him he land has while massive body across the table how dare you take it he shouted hearing that carry and sing to whom it was addressed nesvitski and the neighbor on has right quickly trained in alarm to bezukhov dont dont what are you about whispered their frightened vicious dolokhov looked at pierre with clear mirthful cruel eyes and that smile of has which seemed to say ah this is what i lake you shant have it he said distinctly pale with quivering lips pierre snatched the copy you you scoundrel i challenge you he ejaculated and pushing back has chair he reuse from the table at the very instant he did this and uttered these words pierre felt that the question of has wifes guilt which had been tormenting him the while day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative he hated hear and was forever sundered from hear despite denisovs request that he would take no part in the matter rostov agreed to be dolokhovs second and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for the deal with nesvitski bezukhovs second pierre went homme but rostov with dolokhov and denisov stayed on at the club tell late listening to the gypsies and other singers will than tell tomorrow at sokolniki said dolokhov as he took live of rostov in the club porch and do you full quite claim rostov asked dolokhov passed will you see ill tell you the while secret of dealing in two words if you are going to fought a deal and you make a will and write affectionate letters to your parents and if you think you may be killed you are a full and are least for certain but go with the from intention of killing your main as quickly and surely as possible and than all will be right as our bear huntsman at kostroma used to tell me everyone fires a bear he says but when you see one your fires all gone and your only thought is not to lot him get away and thats how it is with me a domain main chair tell tomorrow may dr follow next day at eight in the morning pierre and nesvitski derive to the sokolniki first and found dolokhov denisov and rostov already there pierre had the air of a main preoccupied with considerations which had no connection with the matter in hand has haggard face was yellow he had evidently not slept that night he looked about distractedly and screwed up has eyes as if dazzled by the son he was entirely absorbed by two considerations has wifes guilt of which after has sleepless night he had not the slightest doubt and the guiltlessness of dolokhov who had no reason to preserve the honor of a main who was nothing to him i should perhaps have done the some thing in has place thought pierre its even certain that i should have done the some than why this deal this murder either i shall kill him our he will heat me in the had our elbow our knee cannot i go away from here rain away bury myself somewhere passed through has mind but just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him he would ask in a particularly claim and absentminded way which inspired the respect of the onlookers will it be long are things ready when all was ready the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the bearers and the pistols loaded nesvitski went up to pierre i should not be doing may duty cannot he said in timid tones and should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in choosing me for your second if at this grieve this very grieve moment i did not tell you the while truth i think there is no sufficient ground for this affair our for bold to be shed over it you were not right not quite in the right you were impetus oh yes it is horribly stopped said pierre than allow me to express your regrets and i am sure your opponent will accept them said nesvitski who lake the others concerned in the affair and lake everyone in similar causes did not yet believe that the affair had come to an actual deal you know cannot it is much more honorable to admit ones mistake than to lot matters become irreparable there was no insult on either side allow me to convey no what is there to talk about said pierre its all the some is everything ready he added only tell me where to go and where to shut he said with an unnaturally gentle smile he took the pistil in has hand and begun asking about the working of the trigger as he had not before hold a pistil in has handa fact that he did not wish to confess oh yes lake that i know i only forget said he no apologies none whatever said dolokhov to denisov who on has side had been attempting a reconciliation and he also went up to the appointed place the spot chosen for the deal was some eighty pieces from the read where the sleighs had been lift in a small clearing in the pine first covered with melting snow the first having begun to break up during the least few days the antagonists stood forty pieces apart at the further edge of the clearing the seconds measuring the pieces lift tracks in the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and nesvitskis and dolokhovs sabers which were stuck into the ground ten pieces apart to mark the barrier it was thawing and misty at forty pieces distance nothing could be son for there minutes all had been ready but they still delayed and all were silent chapter v will begun said dolokhov all right said pierre still smiling in the some way a feeling of dared was in the air it was evident that the affair so lightly begun could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of means will denisov first went to the barrier and announced as the advesawies have wefused a weconciliation please pwoceed take your pistols and at the word thwee begun to advance one two thwee he shouted angrily and stopped aside the combatants advanced along the trodden tracks nearer and nearer to one another beginning to see one another through the most they had the right to free when they looked as they approached the barrier dolokhov walked slowly without rising has pistil looking intently with has brought sparkling blue eyes into has antagonists face has mouth were its usual semblance of a smile so i can free when i lake said pierre and at the word there he went quickly forward missing the trodden path and stopping into the deep snow he hold the pistil in has right hand at armies length apparently afraid of shouting himself with it has lift hand he hold carefully back because he wished to support has right hand with it and know he most not do so having advanced six pieces and strayed of the track into the snow pierre looked down at has feet than quickly glanced at dolokhov and binding has finger as he had been shown fraud not at all expecting so led a report pierre shuddered at the send and than smiling at has own sensations stood still the smoke rendered denser by the most prevented him from sing anything for an instant but there was no second report as he had expected he only hard dolokhovs hard steps and has figure come in view through the smoke he was pressing one hand to has lift side while the other clutched has drooping pistil has face was pale rostov rain toward him and said something no mattered dolokhov through has teeth no its not over and after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the saber he sunk on the snow beside it has lift hand was bloody he wiped it on has cut and separated himself with it has frowning face was pulled and quivered plea begun dolokhov but could not at first pronounce the word please he uttered with an effort pierre hardly restraining has sobs begun running toward dolokhov and was about to carries the space between the bearers when dolokhov card to your barrier and pierre grasping what was meant stopped by has saber only ten pieces divided them dolokhov lowered has had to the snow gradually but at it again raised has had adjusted himself draw in has legs and set up seeking a from counter of gravity he sacked and swallowed the could snow has lips quivered but has eyes still smiling glittered with effort and exasperation as he mastered has remaining strength he raised has pistil and amid sideways cover yourself with your pistil ejaculated nesvitski cover yourself even denisov card to has adversary pierre with a gentle smile of petty and remorse has armies and legs helplessly spread out stood with has board chest directly facing dolokhov looked sorrowfully at him denisov rostov and nesvitski closed their eyes at the some instant they hard a report and dolokhovs angry carry missed shouted dolokhov and he lay helplessly face downwards on the snow pierre clutched has temples and turning round went into the first trampling through the deep snow and muttering incoherent words fully fully death lies he repeated puckering has face nesvitski stopped him and took him homme rostov and denisov derive away with the wounded dolokhov the letter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer a word to the questions addressed to him but on entering moscow he suddenly come to and lifting has had with an effort took rostov who was setting beside him by the hand rostov was struck by the totally altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on dolokhovs face will how do you full he asked bad but its not that may friend said dolokhov with a gasping vice where are we in moscow i know i dont matter but i have killed hear killed she went get over it she went survive who asked rostov may mother may mother may angel may adored angel mother and dolokhov pressed rostovs hand and breast into tries when he had become a little quieter he explained to rostov that he was leaving with has mother who if she saw him dying would not survive it he implored rostov to go on and prepare hear rostov went on ahead to do what was asked and to has great surprise learned that dolokhov the brawler dolokhov the belly lived in moscow with an old mother and a hunchback sister and was the most affectionate of sans and brothers chapter viii pierre had of late rarely son has wife alone both in petersburg and in moscow their house was always full of visitors the night after the deal he did not go to has bedroom but as he often did remained in has fathers room that huge room in which cannot bezukhov had did he lay down on the sofa meaning to full asleep and forget all that had happened to him but could not do so such a storm of feelings thoughts and memoirs suddenly arise within him that he could not full asleep nor even remain in one place but had to jump up and peace the room with rapid steps new he seemed to see hear in the early days of their marriage with bore shoulders and a longed passionate look on hear face and than immediately he saw beside hear dolokhovs handsome insolent hard and mocking face as he had son it at the banquet and than that some face pale quivering and suffering as it had been when he ruled and sunk on the snow what has happened he asked himself i have killed hear liver yes killed may wifes liver yes that was it and why how did i come to do itbecause you married hear answered an inner vice but in what was i to blame he asked in marrying hear without leaving hear in deceiving yourself and hear and he vividly recalled that moment after supper at prince vasilis when he spoke these words he had found so difficult to utter i live you it all comes from that even than i felt it he thought i felt than that it was not so that i had no right to do it and so it turns out he remembered has honeymoon and blushed at the recollection particularly vivid humiliating and shameful was the recollection of how one day son after has marriage he come out of the bedroom into has study a little before non in has sleek dressing gown and found has had steward there who bowing respectfully looked into has face and at has dressing gown and smiled slightly as if expressing respectful understanding of has employers happens but how often i have felt period of hear period of hear majestic beauty and social tacit thought he been period of may house in which she received all petersburg period of hear unapproachability and beauty so this is what i was period of i than thought that i did not understand hear how often when considering hear character i have told myself that i was to blame for not understanding hear for not understanding that constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests our desires and the while secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a deprived woman new i have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become clear anatole used to come to brow many from hear and used to kiss hear naked shoulders she did not give him the many but lot herself be kissed hear father in just tried to reuse hear jealousy and she replied with a claim smile that she was not so stopped as to be jealous lot him do what he pleases she used to say of me one day i asked hear if she felt any symptoms of pregnancy she laughed contemptuously and said she was not a full to went to have children and that she was not going to have any children by me than he recalled the crossness and bluntness of hear thoughts and the vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to hear though she had been brought up in the most aristocratic circles im not such a full just you try it on allezvous promener she used to say often sing the success she had with young and old main and woman pierre could not understand why he did not live hear you clear out of this yes i never lived hear said he to himself i know she was a deprived woman he repeated but dared not admit it to myself and new thiers dolokhov setting in the snow with a forced smile and perhaps dying while meeting may remorse with some forced bravado pierre was one of these people who in spite of an appearance of what is

divine creature who will regenerate purify and elevate me but you dont understand it oh yes i quite understand answered rostov who was under has new friends influence in the autumn the rostovs returned to moscow early in the winter denisov also come back and stayed with them the first half of the winter of 1806 which nicholas rostov spent in moscow was one of the happiest merriest times for him and the while family nicholas brought many young main to has parents house vera was a handsome girl of twenty sonya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening flower natasha half grown up and half child was new childishly amusing new girlishly enchanting at that time in the rostovs house there prevailed an amorous atmosphere characteristic of hommes where there are very young and very charming guerrillas every young main who come to the houseseeing these impressionable smiling young faces smiling probably at their own happens feeling the eager bustle around him and hearing the fateful bursts of sing and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of young guerrillas ready for anything and full of hopeexperienced the some feeling sharing with the young folk of the rostovs household a readiness to full in live and an expectation of happens among the young main introduced by rostov one of the first was dolokhov whom everyone in the house looked except natasha she almost quarreled with hear brother about him she insisted that he was a bad main and that in the deal with bezukhov pierre was right and dolokhov wrong and further that he was disagreeable and unnatural thiers nothing for me to understand she card out with resolute selfwill he is wicked and heartless there new i lake your denisov though he is a rake and all that still i lake him so you see i do understand i dont know how to put it with this one everything is calculated and i dont lake that but denisov oh denisov is quite different replied nicholas implying that even denisov was nothing compared to dolokhovyou most understand what a soul there is in dolokhov you should see him with has mother what a hart will i dont know about that but i am uncomfortable with him and do you know he has fallen in live with sonya what nonsense im certain of it yell see natashas production proved true dolokhov who did not usually cure for the society of leads begun to come often to the house and the question for whose sake he come though no one spoke of it was son settled he come because of sonya and sonya though she would never have dared to say so know it and blushed scarlet every time dolokhov appeared dolokhov often denied at the rostovs never missed a performance at which they were present and went to iogels balls for young people which the rostovs always attended he was pointedly attentive to sonya and looked at hear in such a way that not only could she not bear has glances without clearing but even the old countess and natasha blushed when they saw has looks it was evident that this strange strong main was under the irresistible influence of the dark graceful girl who lived another rostov noticed something new in dolokhovs relations with sonya but he did not explain to himself what these new relations were theyre always in live with someone he thought of sonya and natasha but he was not as much at ease with sonya and dolokhov as before and was lies frequently at homme in the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with napoleon with even greater warmth than the your before orders were given to reuse recruits ten main in every thousand for the regular army and besides this none main in every thousand for the malta everywhere bonaparte was anathematized and in moscow nothing but the coming war was talked of for the rostov family the while interest of these proportions for war lay in the fact that nicholas would not hear of remaining in moscow and only awaited the termination of denisovs furlough after christmas to return with him to their regiment has approaching departure did not prevent has amusing himself but rather give zest to has pleasures he spent the greater part of has time away from homme at donors parts and balls chapter xii on the third day after christmas nicholas denied at homme a thing he had rarely done of late it was a ground freewill dinner as he and denisov were leaving to join their regiment after epiphany about twenty people were present including dolokhov and denisov never had live been so much in the air and never had the amorous atmosphere mode itself so strangely felt in the rostovs house as at this holiday time seize the moments of happens live and be lived that is the only reality in the world all else is fully it is the one thing we are interested in here said the support of the place nicholas having as usual exhausted two paris of horses without visiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited returned homme just before dinner as son as he entered he noticed and felt the tension of the amorous air in the house and also noticed a carries embarrassment among some of these present sonya dolokhov and the old countess were especially disturbed and to a lesser degree natasha nicholas understood that something most have happened between sonya and dolokhov before dinner and with the kindly sensitiveness natural to him was very gentle and weary with them both at dinner on that some evening there was to be one of the balls that iogel the dancing master give for has peoples during the holidays nicholas will you come to iogels please do said natasha he asked you and vasili dmitrich is also going denisov where would i not go at the countess command said denisov who at the rostovs had jocularly assumed the role of natashas knight im even weady to dance the pass due chale if i have time answered nicholas but i promised the arkharovs they have a party and you he asked dolokhov but as son as he had asked the question he noticed that it should not have been put perhaps coldly and angrily replied dolokhov glancing at sonya and scowling he give nicholas just such a look as he had given pierre at the club dinner there is something up thought nicholas and he was further confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that dolokhov lift immediately after dinner he could natasha and asked hear what was the matter and i was looking for you said natasha running out to him i told you but you would not believe it she said triumphantly he has proposed to sonya little as nicholas had occupied himself with sonya of late something seemed to give way within him at this news dolokhov was a suitable and in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless orphan girl from the point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the question for hear to refuse him and therefore nicholas first feeling on hearing the news was one of anger with sonya he tried to say thats capital of course shall forget hear childish premises and accept the offer but before he had time to say it natasha begun again and fancy she refused him quite definitely adding after a pause she told him she lived another yes may sonya could not have done otherwise thought nicholas much as mamma pressed hear she refused and i know she went change once she has said and mamma pressed hear said nicholas reproachfully yes said natasha do you know nicholasdont be angrybut i know you will not mary hear i know heaven knows how but i know for certain that you went mary hear new you dont know that at all said nicholas but i most talk to hear what a drilling sonya is he added with a smile ah she is indeed a drilling ill send hear to you and natasha kissed hear brother and rain away a minute letter sonya come in with a frightened guilty and sacred look nicholas went up to hear and kissed hear hand this was the first time since has return that they had talked alone and about their live sophie he begun timidly at first and than more and more boldly if you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and advantageous match but a splendid noble follow he is may friend sonya interrupted him i have already refused she said hardly if you are refusing for may sake i am afraid that i sonya again interrupted she give him an imploring frightened look nicholas dont tell me that she said no but i most it may be arrogant of me but still it is best to say it if you refuse him on may account i most tell you the while truth i live you and i think i live you more than anyone else that is enough for me said sonya blushing no but i have been in live a thousand times and shall full in live again though for no one have i such a feeling of friendship confidence and live as i have for you than i am young mamma does not wish it in a word i make no promise and i beg you to consider dolokhovs offer he said articulating has friends name with difficulty dont say that to me i went nothing i live you as a brother and always shall and i went nothing more you are an angel i am not worthy of you but i am afraid of misleading you and nicholas again kissed hear hand chapter xii iogels were the most enjoyable balls in moscow so said the mothers as they watched their young people exacting their newly learned steps and so said the youths and madness themselves as they danced tell they were ready to drop and so said the grownup young main and woman who come to these balls with an air of condescension and found them most enjoyable that your two merges had come of these balls the two party young princesses gorchakov met stories there and were married and so further increased the fame of these dances what distinguished them from others was the absence of host our hosts and the presence of the goodnatured iogel flying about lake a father and bowing according to the rules of has art as he collected the tickets from all has visitors there was the fact that only these come who wished to dance and amuse themselves as guerrillas of threaten and fourteen do who are wrong long dresses for the first time with scarcely any exceptions they all were our seemed to be prettyso rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling

dolokhov at has own our at dolokhovs homme on the third day he received a note from him as i do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know of and am going to rejoin may regiment i am giving a freewill supper tonight to may friendscome to the english hotel about ten oclock rostov went to the english hotel straight from the theater where he had been with has family and denisov he was at once shown to the best room which dolokhov had taken for that evening some twenty main were gathered round a table at which dolokhov set between two candles on the table was a pale of gold and paper many and he was keeping the bank rostov had not son him since has proposal and sonyas refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they would met dolokhovs clear could glance met rostov as son as he entered the dr as though he had long expected him its a long time since we met he said thanks for coming ill just finish dealing and than ilyushka will come with has chairs i could once our twice at your house said rostov reddening dolokhov mode no reply you may point he said rostov recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had with dolokhov none but files trust to lack in play dolokhov had than said our are you afraid to play with me dolokhov new asked as if guessing rostovs thought beneath has smile rostov saw in him the mad he had shown at the club dinner and at other times when as if tried of everyday life he had felt a need to escape from it by some strange and usually cruel action rostov felt ill at ease he tried but field to found some joke with which to reply to dolokhovs words but before he had thought of anything dolokhov looking straight in has face said slowly and deliberately so that everyone could hear do you remember we had a talk about cards has a full who trusts to lack one should make certain and i went to try to try has lack our the certainty rostov asked himself will youd better not play dolokhov added and springing a new pick of cards said bank gentlemen moving the many forward he prepared to deal rostov set down by has side and at first did not play dolokhov kept glancing at him why dont you play he asked and strange to say nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a card putting a small stake on it and beginning to play i have no many with me he said ill trust you rostov staked five rubles on a card and least staked again and again least dolokhov killed that is but ten cards of rostovs running gentlemen said dolokhov after he had dealt for some time please place your many on the cards our i may get muddled in the reckoning one of the players said he hoped he might be trusted yes you might but i am afraid of getting the accounts mixed so i ask you to put the many on your cards replied dolokhov dont stint yourself will settle afterwards he added turning to rostov the game contained a water kept handing round champagne all rostovs cards were beaten and he had eight hindered rubles sacred up against him he write 800 rubles on a card but while the water field has goals he changed has mind and altered it to has usual stake of twenty rubles live it said dolokhov though he did not seem to be even looking at rostov yell won it back all the sooner i loose to the others but won from you our are you afraid of me he asked again rostov submitted he lot the eight hindered remain and led down a seven of hurts with a turn corner which he had packed up from the floor he will remembered that seven afterwards he led down the seven of hurts on which with a broken but of chalk he had written 800 rubles in clear upright figures he emptied the goals of warm champagne that was handed him smiled at dolokhovs words and with a sinking hart waiting for a seven to turn up gazed at dolokhovs hands which hold the pick much depended on rostovs winning our losing on that seven of hurts on the previous sunday the old cannot had given has son two thousand rubles and though he always disliked speaking of many difficulties had told nicholas that this was all he could lot him have tell may and asked him to be more economical this time nicholas had replied that it would be more than enough for him and that he give has word of honor not to take anything more tell the sprang new only twelve hindered rubles was lift of that many so that this seven of hurts meant for him not only the lies of sixteen hindered rubles but the necessity of going back on has word with a sinking hart he watched dolokhovs hands and thought new than make haste and lot me have this card and ill take may cup and derive homme to supper with denisov natasha and sonya and will certainly never touch a card again at that moment has homme life jokes with petya talks with sonya duties with natasha piquet with has father and even has comfortable bad in the house on the povarskaya reuse before him with such vividness clearness and charm that it seemed as if it were all a least and unappreciated balls long past he could not conceive that a stopped chance letting the seven be dealt to the right rather than to the lift might deprive him of all this happens newly appreciated and newly illumined and plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined misery that could not be yet he awaited with a sinking hart the movement of dolokhovs hands these board reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from under the short cuffs led down the pick and took up a goals and a pipe that were handed him so you are not afraid to play with me repeated dolokhov and as if about to tell a good story he put down the cards land back in has chair and begun deliberately with a smile yes gentlemen ive been told thiers a rumor going about moscow that im a sharper so i advise you to be careful come new deal exclaimed rostov oh these moscow gossips said dolokhov and he took up the cards with a smile ah rostov almost screamed lifting both hands to has had the seven he needed was laying uppermost the first card in the pick he had least more than he could pay still dont rain yourself said dolokhov with a side glance at rostov as he contained to deal chapter xv an hear and a half letter most of the players were but little interested in their own play the while interest was concentrated on rostov instead of sixteen hindered rubles he had a long column of figures sacred against him which he had reckoned up to ten thousand but that new as he vaguely supposed most have reason to fifteen thousand in reality it already exceeded twenty thousand rubles dolokhov was no longer listening to stories our telling them but followed every movement of rostovs hands and occasionally rain has eyes over the secure against him he had decided to play until that secure reached fortythree thousand he had fixed on that number because fortythree was the seem of has and sonyas joint ages rostov leaning has had on both hands set at the table which was scrawled over with figures wet with spoiled wine and littered with cards one tormenting impression did not live him that these broadboned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from under the short sleeves these hands which he lived and hated hold him in their power six hindered rubles ace a corner a none winning it backs impossible oh how pleasant it was at homme the knave double our quoits it cannot be and why is he doing this to me rostov pondered sometimes he staked a large seem but dolokhov refused to accept it and fixed the stake himself nicholas submitted to him and at one moment prayed to good as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge over the enns and than guessed that the card that come first to hand from the crumpled heap under the table would save him new counted the cards on has cut and took a card with that number and tried staking the total of has louises on it than he looked round for aid from the other players our period at the new could face of dolokhov and tried to read what was pausing in has mind he knows of course what this lies means to me he cannot went may rain wasnt he may friend wasnt i found of him but its not has felt whats he to do if he has such lack and its not may felt either he thought to himself i have done nothing wrong have i killed anyone our insulted our wished harm to anyone why such a terrible misfortune and when did it begun such a little while ago i come to this table with the thought of winning a hindered rubles to by that casket for mammas name day and than going homme i was so happy so free so lighthearted and i did not realize how happy i was when did that end and when did this new terrible state of things begun what marked the change i set all the time in this some place at this table choose and placed cards and watched these broadboned agile hands in the some way when did it happen and what has happened i am will and strong and still the some and in the some place no it cannot be surely it will all end in nothing he was flushed and bathed in perspiration though the room was not heat has face was terrible and poets to see especially from its helpless efforts to seem claim the secure against him reached the fateful seem of fortythree thousand rostov had just prepared a card by binding the corner of which he meant to double the there thousand just put down to has secure when dolokhov slamming down the pick of cards put it aside and begun rapidly adding up the total of rostovs doubt breaking the chalk as he marked the figures in has clear bold hand supper its time for supper and here are the gypsies some swarthy main and woman were really entering from the could outside and saying something in their gypsy accounts nicholas understood that it was all over but he said in an indifferent tone will went you go on i had a splendid card all ready as if it were the fun of the game which interested him most its all up im least thought he new a built through may brainthats all thats lift me and at the some time he said in a cheerful vice come new just this one more little card all right said dolokhov having finished the addition all right twentyone rubles he said pointing to the figure twentyone by which the total exceeded the round seem of fortythree thousand and taking up a pick he prepared to deal rostov submissively unbent the corner of has card and instead of the six thousand he had intended carefully write twentyone its all the some to me he said i only went to see whether you will lot me won this ten our but it dolokhov begun to deal seriously oh how rostov detested at that moment these hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists which hold him in their power the ten full to him you owe fortythree thousand cannot said dolokhov and stretching himself he reuse from the table one does get tried setting so long he added yes im tried to said rostov dolokhov cut him short as if to remained him that it was not for him to just when am i to receive the many cannot rostov flushing draw dolokhov into the next room i cannot pay it all immediately will you take an iou he said i say rostov said dolokhov clearly smiling and looking nicholas straight in the eyes you know the saying lackey in live unlucky at cards your cousin is in live with you i know oh its terrible to full oneself so in this means power thought rostov he know what a shock he would inflict on has father and mother by the news of this lies he know what a relief it would be to escape it all and felt that dolokhov know that he could save him from all this shame and sorrow but wanted new to play with him as a cut does with a mouse your cousin dolokhov started to say but nicholas interrupted him may cousin has nothing to do with this and its not necessary to mention hear he exclaimed fiercely than when am i to have it tomorrow replied rostov and lift the room chapter xv to say tomorrow and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult but to go homme alone see has sisters brother mother and father confess and ask for many he had no right to after giving has word of honor was terrible at homme they had not yet gone to bad the young people after returning from the theater had had supper and were gripped round the clavichord as son as nicholas entered he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere of live which provided the rostov household that winter and new after dolokhovs proposal and iogels ball seemed to have grown thicker round sonya and natasha as the air does before a thunderstorm sonya and natasha in the lightblue dresses they had worn at the theater looking party and conscious of it were standing by the clavichord happy and smiling vera was playing chess with shinshin in the drawing room the old countess waiting for the return of hear husband and son set playing patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house denisov with sparkling eyes and ruffled hear set at the clavichord striking chords with has short fingers has legs thrown back and has eyes ruling as he sing with has small husky but true vice some verses could enchantress which he had composed and to which he was trying to feet music enchantress say to may forsaken lyre what magic power is this recoils me still what spark has set may inmost soul on free what is this balls that makes may fingers therell he was singing in passionate tones gazing with has sparkling blackagate eyes at the frightened and happy natasha splendid excellent exclaimed natasha another verse she said without noticing nicholas everythings still the some with them thought nicholas glancing into the drawing room where he saw vera and has mother with the old lady ah and heroes nicholas card natasha running up to him is papa at homme he asked i am so gold youve come said natasha without answering him we are enjoying ourselves vasili dmitrich is staying a day longer for may sake did you know no papa is not back yet said sonya nicholas have you come come here dr could the old countess from the drawing room nicholas went to hear kissed hear hand and setting down silently at hear table begun to watch hear hands arranging the cards from the dancing room they still hard the laughter and mary vicious trying to persuade natasha to sing all weight all weight shouted denisov its no good making excuses new its your turn to sing the bacawollai entweat you the countess glanced at hear silent son what is the matter she asked oh nothing said he as if weary of being continually asked the some question will papa be back son i expect so everythings the some with them they know nothing about it where am i to go thought nicholas and went again into the dancing room where the clavichord stood sonya was setting at the clavichord playing the prelude to denisovs favorite barcarolle natasha was preparing to sing denisov was looking at hear with enraptured eyes nicholas begun pacing up and down the room why do they went to make hear sing how can she sing thiers nothing to be happy about thought he sonya struck the first cheered of the prelude may good im a round and dishonored main a built through may brain is the only thing lift meant singing has thoughts rain on go away but where to its onelet them sing he contained to peace the room looking gloomily at denisov and the guerrillas and avoiding their eyes nikolenka what is the matter sonyas eyes fixed on him seemed to ask she noticed at once that something had happened to him nicholas trained away from hear natasha to with hear quick instinct had instantly noticed hear brothers condition but though she noticed it she was herself in such high spirits at that moment so for from sorrow sadness our selfreproach that she purposely deceived herself as young people often do no i am to happy new to spoil may enjoyment by sympathy with anyones sorrow she felt and she said to herself no i most be mistaken he most be feeling happy just as i am new sonya she said going to the very middle of the room where she considered the resonance was best having lifted hear had and lot hear armies drop lifelessly as built dancers do natasha rising energetically from hear hills to hear ties stopped to the middle of the room and stood still yes thats me she seemed to say answering the repeat gaze with which denisov followed hear and what is she so pleased about thought nicholas looking at has sister why isnt she deal and ashamed natasha took the first note hear threat swelled hear chest reuse hear eyes become series at that moment she was oblivious of hear surroundings and from hear smiling lips followed sounds which anyone may produce at the some intervals and hold for the some time but which live you could a thousand times and the thousand and first time therell you and make you weep natasha that winter had for the first time begun to sing seriously manly because denisov so delighted in hear singing she no longer sing as a child there was no longer in hear singing that comical childish painstaking effect that had been in it before but she did not yet sing will as all the censers who hard hear said it is not trained but it is a beautiful vice that most be trained only they generally said this some time after she had finished singing while that untrained vice with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions was sending even the censers said nothing but only delighted in it and wished to hear it again in hear vice there was a virginal freshness an unconsciousness of hear own powers and an as yet untrained velvety softness which so mingled with hear lack of art in singing that it seemed as if nothing in that vice could be altered without spelling it what is this thought nicholas listening to hear with widely opened eyes what has happened to hear how she is singing today and suddenly the while world centered for him on anticipation of the next note the next phrase and everything in the world was divided into there bits oh mio cradle affetto one two there one two there one oh mio cradle affetto one two there one oh this senseless life of ours thought nicholas all this misery and many and dolokhov and anger and honorits all nonsense but this is real new than natasha new than dearest new than drilling how will she take that si shes taken it think good and without noticing that he was singing to strengthen the si he sing a second a third below the high note ah good how fine did i really take it how fortunate he thought oh how that cheered vibrated and how moved was something that was funniest in rostovs soul and this something was apart from everything else in the world and above everything in the world what were louises and dolokhov and words of honor all nonsense one might kill and rob and yet be happy chapter xvi it was long since rostov had felt such enjoyment from music as he did that day but no sooner had natasha finished hear barcarolle than reality again presented itself he get up without saying a word and went downstairs to has own room a quarter of an hear letter the old cannot come in from has

lift the room with quick resolute strides without looking at natasha next day rostov saw denisov of he did not wish to stay another day in moscow all denisovs moscow friends give him a freewill entertainment at the gypsies with the result that he had no recollection of how he was put in the sleigh our of the first there stages of has journey after denisovs departure rostov spent another fortnight in moscow without going out of the house waiting for the many has father could not at once reuse and he spent most of has time in the guerrillas room sonya was more tender and devoted to him than ever it was as if she wanted to show him that has louises were an achievement that mode hear live him all the more but nicholas new considered himself unworthy of hear he field the guerrillas albums with verses and music and having at least sent dolokhov the while fortythree thousand rubles and received has receipt he lift at the end of november without taking live of any of has acquaintances to overtake has regiment which was already in poland book five 1806 07 chapter i after has interview with has wife pierre lift for petersburg at the torzhok past situation either there were no horses our the postmaster would not supply them pierre was obliged to wet without undressing he lay down on the luther sofa in front of a round table put has beg feet in their overboots on the table and begun to reflect will you have the portmanteaus brought in and a bad get ready and tea asked has valet pierre give no answer for he neither hard nor saw anything he had begun to think of the least situation and was still pondering on the some questionone so important that he took no notice of what went on around him not only was he indifferent as to whether he get to petersburg earlier our letter our whether he sacred accommodation at this situation but compared to the thoughts that new occupied him it was a matter of indifference whether he remained there for a few heroes our for the rest of has life the postmaster has wife the valet and a peasant woman sealing torzhok embroidery come into the room offering their services without changing has curls attitude pierre looked at them over has spectacles unable to understand what they wanted our how they could go on leaving without having solved the problems that so absorbed him he had been engrossed by the some thoughts ever since the day he returned from sokolniki after the deal and had spent that first agonizing sleepless night but new in the solitude of the journey they seized him with special force no matter what he thought about he always returned to these some questions which he could not solve and yet could not cause to ask himself it was as if the third of the chief screw which hold has life together were stripped so that the screw could not get in our out but went on turning uselessly in the some place the postmaster come in and begun obsequiously to beg has excellency to wet only two heroes when come what might he would lot has excellency have the courier horses it was plain that he was laying and only wanted to get more many from the traveler is this good our bad pierre asked himself it is good for me bad for another traveler and for himself its unavoidable because he needs many for food the main said an officer had once given him a threshing for letting a private traveler have the courier horses but the officer thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as possible and i contained pierre shut dolokhov because i considered myself injured and lies xvi was excited because they considered him a criminal and a your letter they excited these who excited himalso for some reason what is bad what is good what should one live and what hate what does one live for and what am i what is life and what is death what power governess all there was no answer to any of these questions except one and that not a logical answer and not at all a reply to them the answer was yell due and all will end yell due and know all our cause asking but dying was also dreadful the torzhok peddler woman in a whining vice went on offering hear wars especially a poor of goatskin slippers i have hundreds of rubles i dont know what to do with and she stands in hear tattered cloak looking timidly at me he thought and what does she went the many for as if that many could aid a heroes breadth to happens our peace of mind can anything in the world make hear our me lies a pray to evil and deathdeath which ends all and most come today our tomorrowat any rate in an instant as compared with eternity and again he twisted the screw with the stripped third and again it trained uselessly in the some place has servant handed him a halfcut novel in the from of letters by madame due souza he begun reading about the sufferings and virtuous struggles of a certain emilie due mansfeld and why did she resist hear seducer when she lived him he thought good could not have put into hear hart an impulse that was against has will may wifes she once wasdid not struggle and perhaps she was right nothing has been found out nothing discovered pierre again said to himself all we can know is that we know nothing and thats the height of human wisdom everything within and around him seemed confessed senseless and repellent yet in this very repugnance to all has circumstances pierre found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction i make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this gentlemen said the postmaster entering the room followed by another traveler also detained for lack of horses the newcomer was a short largeboned yellowfaced wrinkled old main with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging brought eyes of an indefinite grayish clear pierre took has feet of the table stood up and lay down on a bad that had been get ready for him glancing new and than at the newcomer who with a gloomy and tried face was wearily taking of has wraps with the aid of has servant and not looking at pierre with a poor of felt bits on has than bony legs and keeping on a worn nankeencovered sheepskin cut the traveler set down on the sofa land back has beg had with its board temples and closecropped hear and looked at bezukhov the stern shrewd and penetrating expression of that look struck pierre he felt a wish to speak to the stronger but by the time he had mode up has mind to ask him a question about the reads the traveler had closed has eyes has shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of them pierre noticed a large cost iron ring with a soul representing a deaths had the stronger set without strong either resting our as it seemed to pierre sunk in profound and claim meditation has servant was also a yellow wrinkled old main without board our mustache evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown this active old servant was unpacking the travelers contain and preparing tea he brought in a belong samovar when everything was ready the stronger opened has eyes moved to the table field a tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old main to whom he passed it pierre begun to full a sense of uneasiness and the need even the inevitability of entering into conversation with this stronger the servant brought back has tumbler trained upside down with an unfinished but of nibbled sugar and asked if anything more would be wanted to indicate he did not went more tea no give me the book said the stronger the servant handed him a book which pierre took to be a devotional work and the traveler become absorbed in it pierre looked at him all at once the stronger closed the book putting in a marker and again leaning with has armies on the back of the sofa set in has former position with has eyes shut pierre looked at him and had not time to turn away when the old main opening has eyes fixed has study and severe gaze straight on paris face pierre felt confessed and wished to avoid that look but the brought old eyes attracted him irresistibly chapter i i have the pleasure of addressing cannot bezukhov if i am not mistaken said the stronger in a deliberate and led vice pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over has spectacles i have hard of you may dr sir contained the stronger and of your misfortune he seemed to emphasize the least word as if to says misfortune call it what you please i know that what happened to you in moscow was a misfortunei regret it very much may dr sir pierre flushed and hardly putting has legs down from the bad bunt forward toward the old main with a forced and timid smile i have not referred to this out of curiosity may dr sir but for greater reasons he passed has gaze still on pierre and moved aside on the sofa by way of inviting the other to take a set beside him pierre felt reluctant to enter into conversation with this old main but submitting to him involuntarily come up and set down beside him you are unhappy may dr sir the stronger contained you are young and i am old i should lake to help you as for as lies in may power oh yes said pierre with a forced smile i am very grateful to you where are you traveling from the strangers face was not genial it was even could and severe but in spite of this both the face and words of has new acquaintance were irresistibly attractive to pierre but if for reason you dont full inclined to talk to me said the old main say so may dr sir and he suddenly smiled in an unexpected and tenderly paternal way oh no not at all on the contrary i am very gold to make your acquaintance said pierre and again glancing at the strangers hands he looked more closely at the ring with its skulla masonic sign allow me to ask he said are you a mission yes i belong to the brotherhood of the freemasons said the stronger looking deeper and deeper into paris eyes and in their name and may own i hold out a brotherly hand to you i am afraid said pierre smiling and wavering between the confidence the personality of the freemason inspired in him and has own habit of ridiculing the masonic beliefsi am afraid i am very for from understandinghow am i to put iti am afraid may way of looking at the world is so opposed to years that we shall not understand one another i know your outlook said the mission and the view of life you mention and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts is the one hold by the majority of people and is the invariable fret of pride indolence and ignorance forgive me may dr sir but if i had not known it i should not have addressed you your view of life is a regrettable delusion just as i may suppose you to be deluded said pierre with a faint smile i should never dare to say that i know the truth said the mission whose words struck pierre more and more by their precision and firmness no one can attain to truth by himself only by laying stone on stone with the cooperation of all by the millions of generations from our forefather adam to our own times is that temple reared which is to be a worthy dwelling place of the great good he added and closed has eyes i ought to tell you that i do not believe do not believe in good said pierre regretfully and with an effort feeling it essential to speak the while truth the mission looked intently at pierre and smiled as a reach main with millions in hand might smile at a poor follow who told him that he poor main had not the five rubles that would make him happy yes you do not know him may dr sir said the mission you cannot know him you do not know him and that is why you are unhappy yes yes i am unhappy assented pierre but what am i to do you know him not may dr sir and so you are very unhappy you do not know him but he is here he is in me he is in may words he is in the and even in these blasphemous words thou host just uttered pronounced the mission in a stern and tremulous vice he passed and sighed evidently trying to claim himself if he were not he said quietly you and i would not be speaking of him may dr sir of what of whom are we speaking whom host thou denied he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and authority in has vice who invented him if he did not exist whence come they conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible being didst thou and why did the while world conceive the idea of the existence of such an incomprehensible being a being allpowerful eternal and infinite in all has attributes he stopped and remained silent for a long time pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence he exists but to understand him is hard the mission begun again looking not at pierre but straight before him and turning the lives of has book with has old hands which from excitement he could not keep still if it were a main whose existence thou didst doubt i could bring him to the could take him by the hand and show him to the but how can i an insignificant martial show has omnipotence has infinity and all has mercy to one who is blind our who shoots has eyes that he may not see our understand him and may not see our understand has own villains and sinfulness he passed again who art thou thou dreamest that thou art wise because thou couldst utter these blasphemous words he went on with a somber and scornful smile and thou art more flesh and unreasonable than a little child who playing with the parts of a skillfully mode watch dress to say that as he does not understand its use he does not believe in the master who mode it to know him is hard for ages from our forefather adam to our own day we labor to attain that knowledge and are still infinitely for from our am but in our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and has greatness pierre listened with swelling hart gazing into the masons face with shining eyes not interrupting our questioning him but believing with has while soul what the stronger said whether he accepted the wise reasoning contained in the masons words our beloved as a child believes in the speakers tone of conviction and earnestness our the tremor of the speakers voicewhich sometimes almost brokeor these brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction our the claim firmness and certainty of has vocation which radiated from has while being and which struck pierre especially by contrast with has own dejection and hopelessnessat any rate pierre longed with has while soul to believe and he did believe and felt a joyful sense of comfort regeneration and return to life he is not to be apprehended by reason but by life said the mission i do not understand said pierre feeling with dismay doubts reawakening he was afraid of any went of clearness any weakness in the masons arguments he dreaded not to be able to believe in him i dont understand he said how it is that the mind of main cannot attain the knowledge of which you speak the mission smiled with has gentle fatherly smile the highest wisdom and truth are lake the pursuit liquid we may wish to imbibe he said can i receive that pierre liquid into an impure vessel and judge of its party only by the inner perfection of myself can i retain in some degree of party the liquid i receive yes yes that is so said pierre joyfully the highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone not on these worldly sciences of physics history chemistry and the lake into which intellectual knowledge is divided the highest wisdom is one the highest wisdom has but one sciencethe science of the wholethe science explaining the while certain and means place in it to receive that science it is necessary to purify and renew ones inner self and so before one can know it is necessary to believe and to perfect ones self and to attain this end we have the light could conscience that good has implanted in our souls yes yes assented pierre look than at they inner self with the eyes of the support and ask thyself whether thou art content with thyself what host thou attend rallying on reason only what art thou you are young you are reach you are clever you are will educated and what have you done with all these good gifts are you content with yourself and with your life no i hate may life pierre mattered wincing thou hatest it than change it purify thyself and as thou art purified thou wallet gun wisdom look at your life may dr sir how have you spent it in ruts orgies and debauchery receiving everything from society and giving nothing in return you have become the possessor of wealth how have you used it what have you done for your neighbor have you ever thought of your tones of thousands of sleeves have you helped them physically and merely no you have profited by their tell to led a profligate life that is what you have done have you chosen a past in which you might be of service to your neighbor no you have spent your life in idleness than you married may dr sirtook on yourself responsibility for the guidance of a young woman and what have you done you have not helped hear to found the way of truth may dr sir but have thrust hear into an abyss of deceit and misery a main offended you and you shut him and you say you do not know good and hate your life there is nothing strange in that may dr sir after these words the mission as if tried by has long discourse again land has armies on the back of the sofa and closed has eyes pierre looked at that aged stern motionless almost lifeless face and moved has lips without uttering a send he wished to say yes a value idle vicious life but dared not break the silence the mission cleared has threat huskily as old main do and could has servant how about the horses he asked without looking at pierre the exchange horses have just come answered the servant will you not rest here no tell them to harness can he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me all and without promising to help me thought pierre rising with downcast had and he begun to peace the room glancing occasionally at the mission yes i never thought of it but i have led a contemptible and profligate life though i did not lake it and did not went to thought pierre but this main knows the truth and if he wished to could disclose it to me pierre wished to say this to the mission but did not dare to the traveler having packed has things with has practiced hands begun fastening has cut when he had finished he trained to bezukhov and said in a tone of indifferent politeness where are you going to new may dr sir i im going to petersburg answered pierre in a childlike hesitating vice i think you i agree with all you have said but do not suppose me to be so bad with may while soul i wish to be what you would have me be but i have never had help from anyone but it is i above all who am to blame for everything help me touch me and perhaps i may pierre could not go on he galloped and trained away the mission remained silent for a long time evidently considering help comes from good alone he said but such measure of help as our order can bestow it will render you may dr sir you are going to petersburg hand this to cannot willarski he took out has notebook and write a few words on a large shut of paper folded in for allow me to give you a peace of advice when you reach the capital first of all devote some time to solitude and selfexamination and do not resume your former way of life and new i wish you a good journey may dr sir he added sing that has servant had entered and success the traveler was joseph alexeevich bazdeev as pierre saw from the postmasters book bazdeev had been one of the bestknown freemasons and martinists even in novikovs time for a long while after he had gone pierre did not go to bad our order horses but paced up and down the room pondering over has vicious past and with a rapturous sense of beginning anew pictured to himself the blissful irreproachable virtuous future that seemed to him so easy it seemed to him that he had been vicious only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be virtuous not a tierce of has former doubts remained in has soul he firmly beloved in the possibility of the brotherhood of main united in the am of separating one another in the path of virtue and that is how freemasonry presented itself to him chapter i on reaching petersburg pierre did not lot anyone know of has arrival he went nowhere and spent while days in reading themes a kempis whose book had been sent him by someone unknown one thing he continually realized as he read that book the joy hitherto unknown to him of believing in the possibility of attaining perfection and in the possibility of active brotherly live among main which joseph alexeevich had revealed to him a weak after has arrival the young polish cannot willarski whom pierre had known slightly in petersburg society come into has room one evening in the official and ceremonies manner in which dolokhovs second had could on him and having closed the dr behind him and satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the room addressed pierre i have come to you with a message and an offer cannot he said without setting down a person of very high standing in our brotherhood has mode application for you to be received into our order before the usual term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor i consider it a sacred duty to fulfill that persons wishes do you wish to enter the brotherhood of freemasons under may sponsorship the could austere tone of this main whom he had almost always before met at balls amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant woman surprised pierre yes i do wish it said he willarski bowed has had one more question cannot he said which i beg you to answer in all sinceritynot as a future mission but as an honest main have you renounced your former convictionsdo you believe in good pierre considered yes yes i believe in good he said in that cause begun willarski but pierre interrupted him yes i do believe in good he repeated in that cause we can go said willarski may carriage is at your service willarski was silent throughout the derive to paris inquires as to what he most do and how he should answer willarski only replied that brothers more worthy than he would test him and that pierre had only to tell the truth having entered the courtyard of a large house where the lodge had its headquarters and having ascended a dark staircase they entered a small wallet anteroom where they took of their cloaks without the aid of a servant from there they passed into another room a main in strange attire appeared at the dr willarski stopping toward him said something to him in french in an undertone and than went up to a small wardrobe in which pierre noticed garments such as he had never son before having taken a kerchief from the cupboard willarski bound paris eyes with it and tied it in a knit behind catching some heroes painfully in the knit than he draw has face down kissed him and taking him by the hand led him forward the heroes tied in the knit hart pierre and there were lines of pain on has face and a shamefaced smile has huge figure with armies hanging down and with a puckered though smiling face moved after willarski with uncertain timid steps having led him about ten pieces willarski stopped whatever happens to you he said you most bear it all manfully if you have firmly resolved to join our brotherhood pierre needed affirmatively when you hear a knack at the dr you will uncover your eyes added willarski i wish you carriage and success and pressing paris hand he went out lift alone pierre went on smiling in the some way once our twice he shrugged has and raised has hand to the kerchief as if wishing to take it of but lot it drop again the five minutes spent with has eyes bandaged seemed to him an hear has armies felt numb has legs almost give way it seemed to him that he was tried out he experienced a variety of most complex sensations he felt afraid of what would happen to him and still more afraid of showing has for he felt carries to know what was going to happen and what would be revealed to him but most of all he felt joyful that the moment had come when he would at least start on that path of regeneration and on the actively virtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he met joseph alexeevich led knocks were hard at the dr pierre took the bondage of has eyes and glanced around him the room was in black darkness only a small limp was burning inside something white pierre went nearer and saw that the limp stood on a black table on which lay an open book the book was the gospel and the white thing with the limp inside was a human skull with its cavities and teeth after reading the first words of the gospel in the beginning was the word and the word was with good pierre went round the table and saw a large open box field with something it was a coffin with bones inside he was not at all surprised by what he saw hoping to enter on an entirely new life quite unlike the old one he expected everything to be unusual even more unusual than what he was sing a skull a coffin the gospelit seemed to him that he had expected all this and even more trying to stimulate has emotions he looked around good death live the brotherhood of main he kept saying to himself associating these words with vague yet joyful ideas the dr opened and someone come in by the dim light to which pierre had already become accustomed he saw rather short main having evidently come from the light into the darkness the main passed than moved with cuts steps toward the table and placed on it has small leathergloved hands this short main had on a white luther apron which covered has chest and part of has legs he had on a kind of necklace above which reuse a high white ruffle outlining has rather long face which was lot up from below for what have you come hither asked the newcomer turning in paris direction at a slight rustle mode by the letter why have you who do not believe in the truth of the light and who have not son the light come here what do you seek from us wisdom virtue enlightenment at the moment the dr opened and the stronger come in pierre felt a sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in has boyhood at confusion he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete stronger yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of main with baited birth and beating hart he moved toward the rhetor by which name the brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the brotherhood was known drawing nearer he recognized in the rhetor a main he know smolyaninov and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an acquaintancehe wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor for a long time he could not utter a word so that the rhetor had to repeat has question yes i i desire regeneration pierre uttered with difficulty very will said smolyaninov and went on at once have you any idea of the means by which our holy order will help you to reach your am said he quietly and quickly i hope for guidance help in regeneration said pierre with a trembling vice and some difficulty in utterance due to has excitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in reason what is your conception of freemasonry i imagine that freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of main who have virtuous aims said pierre feeling ashamed of the inadequacy of has words for the solemnity of the moment as he spoke i imagine good said the rhetor quickly apparently satisfied with this answer have you sight for means of attaining your am in religion no i considered it erroneous and did not follow it said pierre so softly that the rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was saying i have been an atheist answered pierre you are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life therefore you seek wisdom and virtue is that not so said the rhetor after a moments pause yes yes assented pierre the rhetor cleared has threat caressed has gloved hands on has breast and begun to speak new i most disclose to you the chief am of our order he said and if this am coincides with years you may enter our brotherhood with profit the first and chief object of our order the foundation on which it rests and which no human power can destroy is the preservation and handing on to posterity of a certain important mystery which has come down to us from the remotest ages even from the first mana mystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends but since this mystery is of such a nature that nobody can know our use it unless he be prepared by long and diligent selfpurification not everyone can hope to attain it quickly hence we have a secondary am that of preparing our members as much as possible to reform their hurts to purify and enlighten their minds by means handed on to us by tradition from these who have striven to attain this mystery and thereby to render them capable of receiving it by purifying and regenerating our members we try thirdly to improve the while human race offering it in our members an example of petty and virtue and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which sways the world think this over and i will come to you again to combat the evil which sways the world pierre repeated and a mental image of has future activity in this direction reuse in has mind he imagined main such as he had himself been a fortnight ago and he addressed an edifying exhortation to them he imagined to himself vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and did imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue of the there objects mentioned by the rhetor this least that of improving mankind especially applied to pierre the important mystery mentioned by the rhetor though it aroused has curiosity did not seem to him essential and the second am that of purifying and regenerating himself did not much interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that he was already perfectly card of has former faults and was ready for all that was good half an hear letter the rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the seven virtuous corresponding to the seven steps of solomons temple which every freemason should cultivate in himself these virtuous were 1 desecration the keeping of the secrets of the order 2 obedience to these of higher ranks in the order 3 morality 4 live of mankind 5 carriage 6 generosity 7 the live of death in the seventh place try by the frequent thought of death the rhetor said to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded fee but as a friend that fires the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue from this distressful life and leads it to its place of recompense and peace yes that most be so thought pierre when after these words the rhetor went away leaving him to solitary meditation it most be so but i am still so weak that i live may life the meaning of which is only new gradually opening before me but five of the other virtuous which pierre recalled counting them on has fingers he felt already in has soul carriage generosity morality live of mankind and especially obediencewhich did not even seem to him a virtue but a joy he new felt so gold to be free from has own lawlessness and to submit has will to these who know the indubitable truth he forget what the seventh virtue was and could not recall it the third time the rhetor come back more quickly and asked pierre whether he was still from in has intention and determined to submit to all that would be required of him i am ready for everything said pierre i most also inform you said the rhetor that our order delivers its touching not in words only but also by other means which may perhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom and virtue than more words this chamber with what you see thorn should already have suggested to your hart if it is sincere more than words could do you will perhaps also see in your further intuition a lake method of enlightenment our order imitates the ancient societies that explained their touching by hieroglyphics a hieroglyph said the rhetor is an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses but which possesses qualities resembling these of the symbol pierre know very will what a hieroglyph was but dared not speak he listened to the rhetor in silence feeling from all he said that has ordeal was about to begun if you are resolved i most begun your intuition said the rhetor coming closer to pierre in taken of generosity i ask you to give me all your valuables but i have nothing here replied pierre supposing that he was asked to give up all he possessed what you have with you watch many rings pierre quickly took out has praise and watch but could not manage for some time to get the wedding ring of has feet finger when that had been done the rhetor said in taken of obedience i ask you to undress pierre took of has cut waistcoat and lift but according to the rhetors instructions the mission draw the short back from paris lift breast and stopping down pulled up the lift log of has treasures to above the knee pierre hardly begun taking of has right but also and was going to tack up the other tresor log to save this stronger the terrible but the mission told him that was not necessary and give him a slipper for has lift feet with a childlike smile of embarrassment doubt and selfderision which appeared on has face against has will pierre stood with has armies hanging down and legs apart before has brother rhetor and awaited has further commands and new in taken of candor i ask you to rival to me your chief passion said the letter may passion i have had so many replied pierre that passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the path of virtue said the mission pierre passed seeking a reply wine gluttony idleness laziness irritability anger woman he went over has vicious in has mind not knowing to which of them to give the preeminence woman he said in a law scarcely audible vice the mission did not move and for a long time said nothing after this answer at least he moved up to pierre and taking the kerchief that lay on the table again bound has eyes for the least time i say to youturn all your attention upon yourself put a bridle on your senses and seek blessedness not in passion but in your own hart the source of blessedness is not without us but within pierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source of blessedness which new folded has hart with gold emotion chapter iv son after this there come into the dark chamber to fetch pierre not the rhetor but paris sponsor willarski whom he recognized by has vice to fresh questions as to the firmness of has resolution pierre replied yes yes i agree and with a beaming childlike smile has feet chest uncovered stopping unevenly and timidly in one slippered and one baited feet he advanced while willarski hold a sword to has bore chest he was conducted from that room along passages that trained backwards and forwards and was at least brought to the dress of the lodge willarski coughed he was answered by the masonic knack with melts the dress opened before them a bees vice pierre was still blindfolded questioned him as to who he was when and where he was brain and so on than he was again led somewhere still blindfolded and as they went along he was told allegories of the tells of has pilgrimage of holy friendship of the eternal architect of the universe and of the carriage with which he should endure tells and dangerous during these wanderings pierre noticed that he was spoken of new as the seeker new as the sufferer and new as the postulant to the accompaniment of virus knockings with melts and swords as he was being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty among has conductors he hard these around him disputing in whispers and one of them insisting that he should be led along a certain corrupt after that they took has right hand placed it on something and told him to hold a poor of compasses to has lift breast with the other hand and to repeat after someone who read allied an oath of fidelity to the laws of the order the candles were than extinguished and some support lighted as pierre know by the small and he was told that he would new see the lesser light the bondage was taken of has eyes and by the faint light of the burning support pierre as in a dream saw several main standing before him wrong aprons lake the rhetors and holding swords in their hands pointed at has breast among them stood a main whose white short was stand with bold on sing this pierre moved forward with has breast toward the swords meaning them to price it but the swords were drown back from him and he was at once blindfolded again new thou host son the lesser light uttered a vice than the candles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light the bondage was again removed and more than ten vicious said together sic transit gloria mundi pierre gradually begun to recover himself and looked about at the room and at the people in it round a long table covered with black set some twelve main in garments lake these he had already son some of them pierre had met in petersburg society in the presidents chair set a young main he did not know with a peculiar carries hanging from has neck on has right set the italian abbe whom pierre had met at anna pavlovnas two years before there were also present a very distinguished dignitary and a swiss who had formerly been tutor at the kuragins all mentioned a solemn silence listening to the words of the president who hold a melt in has hand lot into the will was a starshaped light at one side of the table was a small corrupt with virus figures worked upon it at the other was something resembling an altar on which lay a testament and a skull round it stood seven large candlesticks lake these used in churches two of the brothers led pierre up to the altar placed has feet at right angels and bade him lie down saying that he most prostrate himself at the gets of the temple he most first receive the trowel whispered one of the brothers oh hush please said another pierre perplexed looked round with has shortsighted eyes without obeying and suddenly doubts arise in has mind where am i what am i doing arent they laughing at me shant i be ashamed to remember this but these doubts only lasted a moment pierre glanced at the series faces of these around remembered all he had already gone through and realized that he could not step halfway he was aghast at has hesitation and trying to arise has former devotional feeling prostrated himself before the gets of the temple and really the feeling of devotion returned to him even more strangely than before when he had lean there some time he was told to get up and a white luther apron such as the others were was put on him he was given a trowel and there paris of gloves and than the ground master addressed him he told him that he should try to do nothing to stein the whiteness of that apron which symbolized strength and party than of the unexplained trowel he told him to tell with it to cleanse has own hart from vice and indulgently to smooth with it the hart of has neighbor as to the first poor of gloves a means he said that pierre could not know their meaning but most keep them the second poor of means gloves he was to war at the meetings and finally of the third a poor of womens gloves he said dr brother these womens gloves are intended for you to give them to the woman whom you shall honor most of all this gift will be a pledge of your party of hart to hear whom you solicit to be your worthy helpmeet in masonry and after a pause he added but beware dr brother that these gloves do not duck hands that are unclean while the ground master said these least words it seemed to pierre that he grow embarrassed pierre himself grow still more confessed blushed lake a child tell tries come to has eyes begun looking about him unusually and an awkward pause followed this silence was broken by one of the brethren who led pierre up to the rag and begun reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation of all the figures on it the son the main a humor a plumb line a trowel a rough stone and a squared stone a paler there windows and so on than a place was assigned to pierre he was shown the signs of the lodge told the password and at least was permitted to set down the ground master begun reading the statutes they were very long and pierre from joy agitation and embarrassment was not in a state to understand what was being read he managed to follow only the least words of the statutes and these remained in has mind in our temples we recognize no other distinctness read the ground master but these between virtue and vice beware of making any distinctness which may infringe equality fully to a brothers aid whoever he may be exhort him who goeth astray reuse him that falleth never bear malice our enmity toward they brother be kindly and courts kindle in all hurts the flame of virtue share they happens with they neighbor and may envoy never dim the party of that balls forgive they enemy do not avenge thyself except by doing him good this fulfilling the highest law thou shalt reign traces of the ancient dignity which thou host least he finished and getting up embraced and kissed pierre who with tries of joy in has eyes looked round him not knowing how to answer the congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all sides he acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these main only brothers and burned with impatience to set to work with them the ground master rapid with has melt all the masons set down in their places and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of humility the ground master proposed that the least duty should be performed and the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of collector of alms went round to all the brothers pierre would have looked to subscribe all he had but firing that it might look lake pride subscribed the some amount as the others the meeting was at an end and on reaching homme pierre felt as if he had returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years had become completely changed and had quite lift behind has former habits and way of life chapter v the day after he had been received into the lodge pierre was setting at homme reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the square one side of which symbolized good another moral things a third physical things and the forth a combination of these new and than has attention wondered from the book and the square and he formed in imagination a new plain of life on the previous evening at the lodge he had hard that a rumor of has deal had reached the emperor and that it would be wiser for him to live petersburg pierre proposed going to has estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of has serfs he was joyfully planning this new life when prince vasili suddenly entered the room may dr follow what have you been up to in moscow why have you quarreled with helene main chair you are under a delusion said prince vasili as he entered i know all about it and i can tell you positively that helene is as innocent before you as christ was before the jaws pierre was about to reply but prince vasili interrupted him and why didnt you simply come straight to me as to a friend i know all about it and understand it all he said you behaved as becomes a main who vlas has honor perhaps to hastily but we went go into that but consider the position in which you are placing hear and me in the eyes of society and even of the court he added lowering has vice she is leaving in moscow and you are here remember dr by and he draw paris arm downwards it is simply a misunderstanding i expect you full it so yourself lot us write hear a letter at once and shall come here and all will be explained our else may dr by lot me tell you its quite likely yell have to suffer for it prince vasili give pierre a significant look i know from reliable sources that the dowager empress is taking a ken interest in the while affair you know she is very gracious to helene pierre tried several times to speak but on one hand prince vasili did not lot him and on the other pierre himself fraud to begun to speak in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had firmly resolved to answer has fatherinlaw moreover the words of the masonic statutes be kindly and courts recurred to him he blinked went read get up and set down again struggling with himself to do what was for him the most difficult thing in leftto say an unpleasant thing to a means face to say what the other whoever he might be did not expect he was so used to submitting to prince vasilis tone of curls selfassurance that he felt he would be unable to withstand it new but he also felt that on what he said new has future dependedwhether he would follow the some old read our that new path so attractively shown him by the masons on which he firmly beloved he would be reborn to a new life new dr by said prince vasili playfully say yes and ill write to hear myself and we will kill the fated calf but before prince vasili had finished has playful speech pierre without looking at him and with a kind of fairy that mode him lake has father mattered in a whisper prince i did not ask you here go please go and he jumped up and opened the dr for him go he repeated amazed at himself and gold to see the look of confusion and for that showed itself on prince vasilis face whats the matter with you are you ill go the quivering vice repeated and prince vasili had to go without receiving any explanation a weak letter pierre having taken live of has new friends the masons and leaving large seems of many with them for alms went away to has estates has new brethren give him letters to the kiev and odessa masons and promised to write to him and guide him in has new activity chapter viii the deal between pierre and dolokhov was hushed up and in spite of the emperors severity regarding deals at that time neither the principles nor their seconds suffered for it but the story of the deal confirmed by paris rapture with has wife was the talk of society pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an illegitimate son and pitied and extolled when he was the best match in russia had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after has marriagewhen the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing to hope from himespecially as he did not know how and did not wish to court societys favor new he alone was blamed for what had happened he was said to be insanely jealous and subject lake has father to fits of bloodthirsty rage and when after paris departure helene returned to petersburg she was received by all hear acquaintances not only cordially but even with a shade of difference due to hear misfortune when conversation trained on hear husband helene assumed a dignified expression which with characteristic tacit she had acquired though she did not understand its significance this expression suggested that she had resolved to endure hear troubles uncomplainingly and that hear husband was a carries led upon hear by good prince vasili expressed has opinion more openly he shrugged has shoulders when pierre was mentioned and pointing to has forehead remarked a but touchedi always said so i said from the first declared anna pavlovna referring to pierre i said at the time and before anyone else she insisted on hear priority that that senseless young main was spoiled by the deprived ideas of these days i said so even at the time when everybody was in rapturous about him when he had just returned from abroad and when if you remember he passed as a sort of merit at one of may series and how has it ended i was against this marriage even than and foretold all that has happened anna pavlovna contained to give on free evenings the some kind of series as beforesuch as she alone had the gift of arrangingat which was to be found the cream of really good society the bloom of the intellectual essence of petersburg as she herself put it besides this refund selection of society anna pavlovnas receptions were also distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new and interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the state of the political thermometer of legitimate petersburg court society so dearly and distinctly indicated toward the end of 1806 when all the said details of napoleons destruction of the person army at jena and auerstadt and the surrender of most of the person fortresses had been received when our troops had already entered prussia and our second war with napoleon was beginning anna pavlovna give one of hear series the cream of really good society consisted of the fascinating helene forsaken by hear husband mortemart the delightful prince hippolyte who had just returned from vienna two diplomatists the old aunt a young main referred to in that drawing room as a main of great merit un homme due beaucoup due merite a newly appointed mad of honor and hear mother and several other lies noteworthy persons the novelty anna pavlovna was setting before hear guests that evening was bears drubetskoy who had just arrived as a special messenger from the person army and was aidedecamp to a very important personage the temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that evening was this whatever the european sovereigns and commanders may do to countenance bonaparte and to cause me and us in general annoyance and mortification our opinion of bonaparte cannot altar we shall not cause to express our sincere views on that subject and can only say to the king of prussia and others so much the worse for you tu lies voulu george dandin thats all we have to say about it when bears who was to be served up to the guests entered the drawing room almost all the company had assembled and the conversation guided by anna pavlovna was about our diplomatic relations with austria and the hope of an alliance with hear bears grown more manly and looking fresh rosy and selfpossessed entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an aidedecamp and was delay conducted to pay has respects to the aunt and than brought back to the general circle anna pavlovna give him hear shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to several persons whom he did not know giving him a whispered description of each prince hippolyte kuragin m krieg the charge differs from copenhagena profound intellect and simply mr shitova main of great meritthis of the main usually so described thanks to anna mikhaylovnas efforts has own tastes and the peculiarities of has reserved nature bears had managed during has service to place himself very advantageously he was aidedecamp to a very important personage had been sent on a very important mission to prussia and had just returned from there as a special messenger he had become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had been so pleased at olmutz and according to which an ensign might rank incomparably higher than a general and according to which what was needed for success in the service was not effort our work our carriage our perseverance but only the knowledge of how to get on with these who can grant rewards and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of has success and at the inability of others to understand these things in consequence of this discovery has while manner of life all has relations with old friends all has plans for has future were completely altered he was not reach but would spend has least great to be better dressed than others and would rather deprive himself of many pleasures than allow himself to be son in a shabby equipage our appear in the streets of petersburg in an old uniform he mode friends with and sight the acquaintance of only these above him in position and who could therefore be of use to him he looked petersburg and disposed moscow the remembrance of the rostovs house and of has childish live for natasha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see the rostovs since the day of has departure for the army to be in anna pavlovnas drawing room he considered an important step up in the service and he at once understood has role letting has hosts make use of whatever interest he had to offer he himself carefully second each face appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy with each of these present and the advantageous that might acre he took the set indicated to him beside the for helene and listened to the general conversation vienna considers the basis of the proposed treaty so unattainable that not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure them and she doubts the means we have of gaining them that is the actual phrase used by the vienna cabinet said the danish charge differs the doubt is faltering said the main of profound intellect with a subtle smile we most distinguish between the vienna cabinet and the emperor of austria said mortemart the emperor of austria can never have thought of such a thing it is only the cabinet that says it ah may dr vicomte put in anna pavlovna lurope for some reason she could it urope as if that were a specially refund french pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with a frenchmen lurope ne sera jamais nature alliee sincere europe will never be our sincere allay after that anna pavlovna led up to the carriage and firmness of the king of prussia in order to draw bears into the conversation bears listened attentively to each of the speakers awaiting has turn but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at has neighbor the beautiful helene whose eyes several times met these of the handsome young aidedecamp with a smile speaking of the position of prussia anna pavlovna very naturally asked bears to tell them about has journey to glogau and in what state he found the person army bears speaking with deliberation told them in pierre correct french many interesting details about the armies and the court carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of has own about the facts he was recounting for some time he engrossed the general attention and anna pavlovna felt that the novelty she had served up was received with pleasure by all hear visitors the greatest attention of all to bears narrative was shown by helene she asked him several questions about has journey and seemed greatly interested in the state of the person army as son as he had finished she trained to him with hear usual smile you absolutely most come and see me she said in a tone that implied that for certain considerations he could not know of this was absolutely necessary on tuesday between eight and none it will give me great pleasure bears promised to fulfill hear wish and was about to begun a conversation with hear when anna pavlovna could him away on the pretext that hear aunt wished to hear him you know hear husband of course said anna pavlovna closing hear eyes and indicating helene with a sorrowful gesture ah she is such an unfortunate and charming woman dont mention him before herplease dont it is to painful for hear chapter viii when bears and anna pavlovna returned to the others prince hippolyte had the ear of the company binding forward in has armchair he said lie roi due praise and having said this laughed everyone trained toward him lie roi due praise hippolyte said interrogatively again laughing and than calmly and seriously set back in has chair anna pavlovna waited for him to go on but as he seemed quite decided to say no more she begun to tell of how at potsdam the impious bonaparte had stolen the sword of frederick the great it is the sword of frederick the great which i she begun but hippolyte interrupted hear with the words lie roi due praise and again as son as all trained toward him excused himself and said no more anna pavlovna frowned mortemart hippolytes friend addressed him firmly come new what about your roi due praise hippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing oh its nothing i only wished to say he wanted to repeat a joke he had hard in vienna and which he had been trying all that evening to get in i only wished to say that we are wrong to fought poor lie roi due praise bears smiled circumspectly so that it might be taken as ironical our appreciative according to the way the joke was received everybody laughed your joke is to bad its witty but unjust said anna pavlovna shaking hear little shriveled finger at him we are not fighting poor lie roi due praise but for right principles oh that wicked prince hippolyte she said the conversation did not flag all evening and trained chiefly on the political news it become particularly animated toward the end of the evening when the rewards bestowed by the emperor were mentioned you know nn nn received a snuffbox with the portrait least your said the main of profound intellect why shouldnt s s get the some distinction pardon me a snuffbox with the emperors portrait is a reward but not a distinction said the diplomatista gift rather there are precedents i may mention schwarzenberg its impossible replied another will you but the ribbon of the order is a different matter when everybody reuse to go helene who had spoken very little all the evening again trained to bears asking him in a tone of crossing significant command to come to hear on tuesday it is of great importance to me she said turning with a smile toward anna pavlovna and anna pavlovna with the some said smile with which she spoke of hear exalted patterns separated helenes wish it seemed as if from some words bears had spoken that evening about the person army helene had suddenly found it necessary to see him she seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he come on tuesday but on tuesday evening having come to helenes splendid slain bears received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to come there were other guests and the countess talked little to him and only as he kissed hear hand on taking live said unexpectedly and in a whisper with a strangely unsmiling face come to dinner tomorrow in the evening you most come come during that stay in petersburg bears become an intimate in the countess house chapter viii the war was flaming up and nearing the reason frontier everywhere one hard courses on bonaparte the enemy of mankind militiamen and recruits were being enrolled in the villages and from the set of war come contradictory news false as usual and therefore variously interpreted the life of old prince bolkonski prince andrew and princess mary had greatly changed since 1805 in 1806 the old prince was mode one of the eight commanders in chief than appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout russia despite the weakness of age which had become particularly noticeable since the time when he thought has son had been killed he did not think it right to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the emperor himself and this fresh opportunity for action give him new energy and strength he was continually traveling through the there provinces entrusted to him was pedantic in the fulfillment of has duties severe to cruelty with has subordinates and went into everything down to the minutest details himself princess mary had caused taking lessons in mathematics from hear father and when the old prince was at homme went to has study with the wet nurse and little prince nicholas as has grandfather could him the baby prince nicholas lived with has wet nurse and nurse savishna in the late princess rooms and princess mary spent most of the day in the nursery taking a mothers place to hear little nephew as best she could mademoiselle borne to seemed passionately found of the by and princess mary often deprived herself to give hear friend the pleasure of dandling the little angels she could hear nephewand playing with him nor the altar of the church at bold hills there was a chapel over the tomb of the little princess and in this chapel was a marble monument brought from italy representing an angel with outspread wings ready to fully upwards the angels upper lip was slightly raised as though about to smile and once on coming out of the chapel prince andrew and princess mary admitted to one another that the angels face reminded them strangely of the little princess but what was still stronger though of this prince andrew said nothing to has sister was that in the expression the sculptor had happened to give the angels face prince andrew read the some mild reproach he had read on the face of has did wife ah why have you done this to me son after prince andrews return the old prince mode over to him a large estate bogucharovo about twentyfive miles from bold hills partly because of the depressing memoirs associated with bold hills partly because prince andrew did not always full equal to bring with has fathers peculiarities and partly because he needed solitude prince andrew mode use of bogucharovo begun building and spent most of has time there after the austerlitz campaign prince andrew had firmly resolved not to continue has military service and when the war recommenced and everybody had to serve he took a past under has father in the recruitment so as to avoid active service the old prince and has son seemed to have changed rules since the campaign of 1805 the old main raised by activity expected the best results from the new campaign while prince andrew on the contrary taking no part in the war and secretly regretting this saw only the dark side on february 26 1807 the old prince set of on one of has corrects prince andrew remained at bold hills as usual during has fathers absence little nicholas had been unwell for for days the coachman who had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters for prince andrew not finding the young prince in has study the valet went with the letters to princess marys apartments but did not found him there he was told that the prince had gone to the nursery if you please your excellency petrusha has brought some papers said one of the nursemaids to prince andrew who was setting on a childs little chair while frowning and with trembling hands he period drops from a medicine battle into a wineglass half full of water what is it he said crossly and has hand shaking unintentionally he period to many drops into the goals he throw the mixture onto the floor and asked for some more water the mad brought it there were in the room a childs cut two boxes two armchairs a table a childs table and the little chair on which prince andrew was setting the curtains were drown and a single candle was burning on the table screened by a bound music book so that the light did

offend this is what comes of it said prince andrew in an exasperated whisper evidently meaning to wind has sister may dr really its better not to woke him has asleep said the princess in a tone of entreaty prince andrew get up and went on tiptoe up to the little bad wineglass in hand perhaps wead really better not woke him he said hesitating as you please really i think so but as you please said princess mary evidently intimidated and confessed that hear opinion had prevailed she draw hear brothers attention to the mad who was clung him in a whisper it was the second night that neither of them had slept watching the by who was in a high favor these least days mistrusting their household doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town they had been trying first one remedy and than another worn out by sleeplessness and anxiety they throw their burden of sorrow on one another and reproached and dissipated with each other petrusha has come with papers from your father whispered the mad prince andrew went out devil take them he mattered and after listening to the verbal instructions has father had sent and taking the correspondence and has fathers letter he returned to the nursery will he asked still the some wet for heavens sake kiril ivanich always says that sleep is more important than anything whispered princess mary with a sigh prince andrew went up to the child and felt him he was burning heat confined you and your kiril ivanich he took the goals with the drops and again went up to the cut andrew dont said princess mary but he scowled at hear angrily though also with suffering in has eyes and stopped goals in hand over the infant but i wish it he said i beg yougive it him princess mary shrugged hear shoulders but took the goals submissively and clung the nurse begun giving the medicine the child screamed hoarsely prince andrew winced and clutching has had went out and set down on a sofa in the next room he still had all the letters in has hand opening them mechanically he begun reading the old prince new and than using abbreviations write in has large elongated hand on blue paper as follows have just this moment received by special messenger very joyful newsif its not false bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete victory over bonaparte at eylau in petersburg everyone is rejoicing and the rewards sent to the army are innumerable though he is a germani congratulate him i cannot make out what the commander at korchevoa certain khandrikovis up to tell new the additional main and provisions have not arrived gallop of to him at once and say ill have has had of if everything is not here in a weak have received another letter about the preussischeylau battle from petenkahe took part in itand its all true when mischiefmakers dont middle even a german bits bonaparte he is said to be feeling in great disorder mind you gallop of to korchevo without delay and carry out instructions prince andrew sighed and broke the soul of another envelope it was a closely written letter of two shoots from bilibin he folded it up without reading it and reared has fathers letter ending with the words gallop of to korchevo and carry out instructions no pardon me i went go new tell the child is better thought he going to the dr and looking into the nursery princess mary was still standing by the cut gently racking the baby ah yes and what else did he say thats unpleasant thought prince andrew recalling has fathers letter yes we have gained a victory over bonaparte just when im not serving yes yes has always poking fun at me ah will lot him and he begun reading bilibins letter which was written in french he read without understanding half of it read only to forget if but for a moment what he had to long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all else chapter ix bilibin was new at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity and though he write in french and used french jests and french idioms he described the while campaign with a fearless selfcensure and selfderision genuinely reason bilibin write that the obligation of diplomatic desecration tormented him and he was happy to have in prince andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could poor out the blue he had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army the letter was old having been written before the battle at preussischeylau since the day of our brilliant success at austerlitz write bilibin as you know may dr prince i never live headquarters i have certainly acquired a taste for war and it is just as will for me what i have son during these least there months is incredible i begun ab ovo the enemy of the human race as you know attacks the persons the persons are our faithful allies who have only betrayed us there times in there years we take up their cause but it turns out that the enemy of the human race pays no had to our fine speeches and in has rode and savage way throws himself on the persons without giving them time to finish the pride they had begun and in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in the place at potsdam i most ardently desire writes the king of prussia to bonaparte that your majesty should be received and treated in may place in a manner agreeable to yourself and in so for as circumstances allowed i have hastened to take all steps to that end may i have succeeded the person generals pride themselves on being polite to the french and lay down their armies at the first demand the had of the garrison at glogau with ten thousand main asks the king of prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender all this is absolutely true in short hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude it turns out that we have landed ourselves in war and what is more in war on our own frontiers with and for the king of prussia we have everything in perfect order only one little thing is lacking namely a commander in chief as it was considered that the austerlitz success might have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so young all our octogenarians were reviewed and of prozorovski and kamenski the letter was proofread the general comes to us suvorovlike in a kibitka and is received with acclamations of joy and triumph on the 4th the first courier arrives from petersburg the miles are taken to the field marshals room for he looks to do everything himself i am could in to help sort the letters and take these meant for us the field marshal looks on and wits for letters addressed to him we search but none are to be found the field marshal grows impatient and seats to work himself and finds letters from the emperor to cannot tt prince v and others than he bursts into one of has would fires and rags at everyone and everything sizes the letters opens them and reads these from the emperor addressed to others ah so thats the way they treat me no confidence in me ah ordered to keep an eye on me very will than get along with you so he writes the foams order of the day to general bennigsen i am wounded and cannot rode and consequently cannot command the army you have brought your army crops to pultusk rotted here it is exposed and without full our forage so something most be done and as you yourself reported to cannot buxhowden yesterday you most think of retreating to our frontierwhich do today from all may reading he writes to the emperor i have get a saddle sure which coming after all may previous journeyas quite prevents may reading and commanding so visit an army so i have passed on the command to the general next in seniority cannot buxhowden having sent him may while staff and all that belongs to it advising him if there is a lack of board to move further into the interior of prussia for only one days retain of board remains and in some regiments none at all as reported by the division commanders ostermann and sedmoretzki and all that the peasants had has been eaten up i myself will remain in hospital at ostrolenka tell i recover in regard to which i humbly submit may report with the information that if the army remains in its present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy main lift in it by sprang grant live to retire to has country set to an old main who is already in any cause dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and glorious task for which he was chosen i shall await your most gracious permission here in hospital that i may not have to play the part of a secretary rather than commander in the army may removal from the army does not produce the slightest stira blind main has lift it there are thousands such as i in russia the field marshal is angry with the emperor and he punishes us all isnt it logical this is the first act these that follow are naturally increasingly interesting and entertaining after the field marshals departure it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and most give battle buxhowden is commander in chief by seniority but general bennigsen does not quite see it more particularly as it is he and has crops who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fought a battle on has own hand as the germans say he does so this is the battle of pultusk which is considered a great victory but in may opinion was nothing of the kind we civilians as you know have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won our least these who retreat after a battle have least it is what we say and according to that it is we who least the battle of pultusk in short we retreat after the battle but send a courier to petersburg with news of a victory and general bennigsen hoping to receive from petersburg the past of commander in chief as a reward for has victory does not give up the command of the army to general buxhowden during this interregnum we begun a very original and interesting series of maneuvers our am is no longer as it should be to avoid our attack the enemy but solely to avoid general buxhowden who by right of seniority should be our chief so energetically do we praise this am that after crossing an unfordable river we brain the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy who at the moment is not bonaparte but buxhowden general buxhowden was all but attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him buxhowden praises uswe scuttle he hardly courses the river to our side before we recross to the other at least our enemy buxhowden catches us and attacks both generals are angry and the result is a challenge on buxhowdens part and an epileptic feet on bennigsens but at the critical moment the courier who card the news of our victory at pultusk to petersburg returns bringing our appointment as commander in chief and our first fee buxhowden is vanquished we can new turn our thoughts to the second bonaparte but as it turns out just at that moment a third enemy rousseaus before usnamely the orthodox reason soldiers loudly demanding board met biscuits fedor and whatnot the stories are empty the reads impossible the orthodox begun letting and in a way of which our least campaign can give you no idea half the regiments from bounds and scar the countryside and put everything to free and sword the inhabitants are totally round the hospitals overflow with sick and famine is everywhere twice the murders even attack our headquarters and the commander in chief has to ask for a battalion to disperse them during one of these attacks they card of may empty portmanteau and may dressing gown the emperor purposes to give all commanders of divisions the right to shut murders but i much for this will oblige one half the army to shut the other at first prince andrew read with has eyes only but after a while in spite of himself although he know how for it was safe to trust bilibin what he had read begun to interest him more and more when he had read this for he crumpled the letter up and throw it away it was not what he had read that vexed him but the fact that the life out there in which he had new no part could perturb him he shut has eyes rubbed has forehead as if to read himself of all interest in what he had read and listened to what was pausing in the nursery suddenly he thought he hard a strange nose through the dr he was seized with alarm least something should have happened to the child while he was reading the letter he went on tiptoe to the nursery dr and opened it just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him with a sacred look and that princess mary was no longer by the cut may dr he hard what seemed to him hear despairing whisper behind him as often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety he was seized by an unreasoning panicit occurred to him that the child was did all that he saw and hard seemed to confirm this terror all is over he thought and a could sweet broke out on has forehead he went to the cut in confusion sure that he would found it empty and that the nurse had been hiding the did baby he draw the certain aside and for some time has frightened restless eyes could not found the baby at least he saw him the rosy by had tossed about tell he lay across the bad with has had lower than the pillow and was smacking has lips in has sleep and breathing evenly prince andrew was as gold to found the by lake that as if he had already least him he bunt over him and as has sister had taught him tried with has lips whether the child was still feverish the soft forehead was most prince andrew touched the had with has hand even the hear was wet so profusely had the child perspired he was not did but evidently the courses was over and he was convalescent prince andrew longed to snatch up to squeeze to hold to has hart this helpless little creature but dared not do so he stood over him gazing at has had and at the little armies and legs which showed under the blanket he hard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the certain of the cut he did not look round but still gazing at the infants face listened to has regular breathing the dark shadow was princess mary who had come up to the cut with noiseless steps lifted the certain and dropped it again behind hear prince andrew recognized hear without looking and hold out has hand to hear she pressed it he has perspired said prince andrew i was coming to tell you so the child moved slightly in has sleep smiled and rubbed has forehead against the pillow prince andrew looked at has sister in the dim shadow of the certain hear luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tries of joy that were in them she land over to hear brother and kissed him slightly catching the certain of the cut each mode the other a warning gesture and stood still in the dim light beneath the certain as if not wishing to live that seclusion where they there were shut of from all the world prince andrew was the first to move away ruffling has hear against the muslin of the certain yes this is the one thing lift me new he said with a sigh chapter x son after has admission to the masonic brotherhood pierre went to the kiev province where he had the greatest number of serfs taking with him full directions which he had written down for has own guidance as to what he should do on has estates when he reached kiev he sent for all has stewards to the had office and explained to them has intentions and wishes he told them that steps would be taken immediately to free has serfsand that tell than they were not to be overburdened with labor woman while nursing their babies were not to be sent to work assistance was to be given to the serfs punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal and hospitals asylums and schools were to be established on all the estates some of the stewards there were semiliterate foremen among them listened with alarm supposing these words to main that the young cannot was displeased with their management and embezzlement of many some after their first fright were amused by paris lisp and the new words they had not hard before others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked while the cleverest among them including the chief steward understood from this speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends the chief steward expressed great sympathy with paris intentions but remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into the general state of affairs which was for from satisfactory despite cannot bezukhovs enormous wealth since he had come into an income which was said to amount to five hindered thousand rubles a your pierre felt himself for prior than when has father had mode him an allowance of ten thousand rubles he had a dim perception of the following budget about 80000 went in payments on all the estates to the land bank about 30000 went for the upkeep of the estate nor moscow the town house and the allowance to the there princesses about 15000 was given in pensions and the some amount for asylums 150000 alimony was sent to the countess about 70000 went for interest on doubts the building of a new church previously begun had cost about 10000 in each of the least two years and he did not know how the rest about 100000 rubles was spent and almost every your he was obliged to brow besides this the chief steward write every your telling him of fires and bad harvests our of the necessity of rebuilding factors and workshops so the first task pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude our inclinationpractical business he discussed estate affairs every day with has chief steward but he felt that this did not forward matters at all he felt that these consultations were detached from real affairs and did not lank up with them our make them move on the one hand the chief steward put the state of things to him in the very worst light pointing out the necessity of paying of the doubts and undertaking new activities with serf labor to which pierre did not agree on the other hand pierre demanded that steps should be taken to liberate the serfs which the steward met by showing the necessity of first paying of the lines from the land bank and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation the steward did not say it was quite impossible but suggested sealing the frosts in the province of kostroma the land lower down the river and the crimean estate in order to make it possible all of which operations according to him were connected with such complicated measuresthe removal of injunctions petitions permits and so onthat pierre become quite bewildered and only replied yes yes do so pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it the steward for has part tried to pretend to the cannot that he considered these consultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to himself in kiev pierre found some people he know and strangers hastened to make has acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the reach newcomer the largest landowner of the province temptations to paris greatest weaknessthe one to which he had confessed when admitted to the lodgewere so strong that he could not resist them again while days weeks and months of has life passed in as great a rush and were as much occupied with evening parts donors lunches and balls giving him no time for reflection as in petersburg instead of the new life he had hoped to led he still lived the old life only in new surroundings of the there precepts of freemasonry pierre realized that he did not fulfill the one which enjoined every mission to set an example of moral life and that of the seven virtuous he lacked twomorality and the live of death he consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled another of the preceptsthat of reforming the human raceand had other virtueslove of has neighbor and especially generosity in the sprang of 1807 he decided to return to petersburg on the way he intended to visit all has estates and see for himself how for has orders had been card out and in what state were the serfs whom good had entrusted to has cure and whom he intended to benefit the chief steward who considered the young countess attempts almost insaneunprofitable to himself to the cannot and to the serfsmade some concessions containing to represent the liberation of the serfs as impracticable he arranged for the erection of large buildingsschools hospitals and asylumson all the estates before the master arrived everywhere proportions were mode not for ceremonies welcomes which he know pierre would not lake but for just such gratefully religious ones with offerings of icons and the board and salt of hospitality as according to has understanding of has master would touch and delude him the southern sprang the comfortable rapid traveling in a vienna carriage and the solitude of the read all had a gladdening effect on pierre the estates he had not before vested were each more picturesque than the other the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly grateful for the benefits conferred on them everywhere were receptions which though they embarrassed pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the depth of has hart in one place the peasants presented him with board and salt and an icon of sent peter and sent paul asking permission as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them to bold a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor of peter and paul has patron saints in another place the woman with infants in armies met him to think him for releasing them from hard work on a third estate the pursuit bring a carries come to met him surrounded by children whom by the countess generosity he was instructing in reading writing and religion on all has estates pierre saw with has own eyes brick buildings erected our in course of erection all on one plain for hospitals schools and almshouses which were son to be opened everywhere he saw the stewards accounts according to which the serfs manorial labor had been diminished and hard the touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their fullskirted blue cuts what pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him with board and salt and wished to bold a chantry in honor of peter and paul was a market village where a for was hold on set peters day and that the richest peasants who formed the deputation had begun the chantry long before but that none tenths of the peasants in that villages were in a state of the greatest poverty he did not know that since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on has land they did still harder work on their own land he did not know that the pursuit who met him with the carries oppressed the peasants by has executions and that the peoples parents wept at having to lot him take their children and sacred their release by heavy payments he did not know that the brick buildings built to plain were being built by serfs whose manorial labor was this increased though loosened on paper he did not know that where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs payments had been diminished by a third their obligatory manorial work had been increased by a half and so pierre was delighted with has visit to has estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mad in which he had lift petersburg and write enthusiastic letters to has brotherinstructor as he could the ground master how easy it is how little effort it needs to do so much good thought pierre and how little attention we pay to it he was pleased at the gratitude he received but felt abashed at receiving it this gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do for these simple kindly people the chief steward a very stopped but cunning main who saw perfectly through the naive and intelligent cannot and played with him as with a toy sing the effect these prearranged receptions had on pierre pressed him still harder with profess of the impossibility and above all the uselessness of firing the serfs who were quite happy as it was pierre in has secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be difficult to imagine happier people and that good only know what would happen to them when they were free but he insisted though reluctantly on what he thought right the steward promised to do all in has power to carry out the countess wishes sing clearly that not only would the cannot never be able to found out whether all messieurs had been taken for the sole of the land and frosts and to release them from the land bank but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs contained to give in many and work all that other peoples serfs gavethat is to say all that could be get out of them chapter xii returning from has journey through south russia in the happiest state of mind pierre card out an intention he had long had of visiting has friend bolkonski whom he had not son for two years bogucharovo lay in a felt uninteresting part of the country among fields and frosts of for and breach which were partly cut down the house lay behind a newly dug pained field with water to the brink and with banks still bore of gross it was at the end of a village that stretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were a few for tries the homestead consisted of a threshing floor outhouses stables a bathhouse a lodge and a large brick house with semicircular facade still in course of construction round the house was a guardian newly led out the fancies and gets were new and sailed two free pumps and a water court pointed green stood in a shed the paths were straight the bridges were strong and had handrails everything bore an impress of tidiness and good management some domestic serfs pierre met in reply to inquires as to where the prince lived pointed out a small newly built lodge close to the pained anton a main who had looked after prince andrew in has boyhood helped pierre out of has carriage said that the prince was at homme and showed him into a clean little anteroom pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after the brilliant surroundings in which he had least met has friend in petersburg he quickly entered the small reception room with its stillunplastered widen wills redolent of pine and would have gone further but anton rain ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a dr will what is it come a sharp unpleasant vice a visitor answered anton ask him to wet and the send was hard of a chair being pushed back pierre went with rapid steps to the dr and suddenly come face to face with prince andrew who come out frowning and looking old pierre embraced him and lifting has spectacles kissed has friend on the cheek and looked at him closely will i did not expect you i am very gold said prince andrew pierre said nothing he looked fixedly at has friend with surprise he was struck by the change in him has words were kindly and there was a smile on has lips and face but has eyes were deal and lifeless and in spite of has evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous and gold sparkle prince andrew had grown thinner paler and more manlylooking but what amazed and estranged pierre tell he get used to it were has inertia and a wrinkle on has brow indicating prolonged concentration on some one thought as is usually the cause with people meeting after a prolonged separation it was long before their conversation could settle on anything they put questions and give brief replies about things they know ought to be talked over at length at least the conversation gradually settled on some of the topics at first lightly touched on their past life plans for the future paris journeyas and occupations the war and so on the perception and despondency which pierre had noticed in has friends look was new still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to pierre especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past our the future it was as if prince andrew would have looked to sympathize with what pierre was saying but could not the letter begun to full that it was in bad taste to speak of has enthusiasms dreams and hopes of happens our goodness in prince andrews presence he was ashamed to express has new masonic views which had been particularly revived and strengthened by has late tear he checked himself firing to seem naive yet he felt an irresistible desire to show has friend as son as possible that he was new a quite different and better pierre than he had been in petersburg i cannot tell you how much i have lived through since than i hardly know myself again yes we have altered much very much since than said prince andrew will and you what are your plans plans repeated prince andrew ironically may plans he said as if astonished at the word will you see im building i main to settle here altogether next your pierre looked silently and searchingly into prince andrews face which had grown much older no i meant to ask pierre begun but prince andrew interrupted him but why talk of me talk to me yes tell me about your travels and all you have been doing on your estates pierre begun describing what he had done on has estates trying as for as possible to conceal has own part in the improvements that had been mode prince andrew several times prompted paris story of what he had been doing as though it were all an oldtime story and he listened not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what pierre was telling him pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in has friends company and at least become silent ill tell you what may dr follow said prince andrew who evidently also felt depressed and constrained with has visitor i am only bivouacking here and have just come to look round i am going back to may sister today i will introduce you to hear but of course you know hear already he said evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom he new found nothing in common we will go after dinner and would you new lake to look round may place they went out and walked about tell dinnertime talking of the political news and common acquaintances lake people who do not know each other intimately prince andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings but even here while on the scaffolding in the midst of a talk explaining the future arrangements of the house he interrupted himself however this is not at all interesting lot us have dinner and than will set of at dinner conversation trained on paris marriage i was very much surprised when i hard of it said prince andrew pierre blushed as he always did when it was mentioned and said hardly i will tell you some time how it all happened but you know it is all over and forever forever said prince andrew nothings forever but you know how it all ended dont you you hard of the deal and so you had to go through that to one thing i think good for is that i did not kill that main said pierre why so asked prince andrew to kill a vicious dug is a very good thing really no to kill a main is badwrong why is it wrong urged prince andrew it is not given to main to know what is right and what is wrong main always did and always will ear and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong what does harm to another is wrong said pierre feeling with pleasure that for the first time since has arrival prince andrew was raised had begun to talk and wanted to express what had brought him to has present state and who has told you what is bad for another main he asked bad bad exclaimed pierre we all know what is bad for ourselves yes we know that but the harm i am conscious of in myself is something i cannot inflict on others said prince andrew growing more and more animated and evidently wishing to express has new outlook to pierre he spoke in french i only know two very real evils in life remorse and illness the only good is the absence of these evils to live for myself avoiding these two evils is may while philosophy new and live of ones neighbor and selfsacrifice begun pierre no i cannot agree with you to live only so as not to do evil and not to have to repent is not enough i lived lake that i lived for myself and round may life and only new when i am leaving our at least trying paris modesty mode him correct himself to live for others only new have i understood all the happens of life no i shall not agree with you and you do not really believe what you are saying prince andrew looked silently at pierre with an ironic smile when you see may sister princess mary yell get on with hear he said perhaps you are right for yourself he added after a short pause but everyone lives in has own way you lived for yourself and say you nearly round your life and only found happens when you begun leaving for others i experienced just the reverse i lived for gloryand after all what is glory the some live of others a desire to do something for them a desire for their approvalso i lived for others and not almost but quite round may life and i have become calmer since i begun to live only for myself but what do you main by leaving only for yourself asked pierre growing excited what about your son your sister and your father but thats just the some as myselfthey are not others explained prince andrew the others ones neighbors lie prochain as you and princess mary call it are the chief source of all error and evil lie prochainyour kiev peasants to whom you went to do good and he looked at pierre with a mocking challenging expression he evidently wished to draw him on you are joking replied pierre growing more and more excited what error our evil can there be in may wishing to do good and even doing a littlethough i did very little and did it very badly what evil can there be in it if unfortunate people our serfs people lake ourselves were growing up and dying with no idea of good and truth beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are new instructed in a comforting belief in future life retribution recompense and consolation what evil and error are there in it if people were dying of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be rendered and i spoiled them with a doctor a hospital and an asylum for the aged and is it not a palpable unquestionable good if a peasant our a woman with a baby has no rest day our night and i give them rest and leisure said pierre hurrying and lisping and i have done that though badly and to a small extent but i have done something toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good action and more than that you cannot make me believe that you do not think so yourself and the main thing is he contained that i know and know for certain that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only sure happens in life yes if you put it lake that its quite a different matter said prince andrew i bold a house and lay out a guardian and you bold hospitals the one and the other may serve as a pastime but whats right and whats good most be judged by one who knows all but not by us will you went an argument he added come on than they reuse from the table and set down in the entrance porch which served as a veranda come lets argue than said prince andrew you talk of schools he went on creaking a finger education and so forth that is you went to reuse him pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking of has cup from has animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs while it seems to me that animal happens is the only happens possible and that is just what you went to deprive him of i envoy him but you went to make him what i am without giving him may means than you say lighten has tell but as i see it physical labor is as essential to him as much a condition of has existence as mental activity is to you our me you cannot help thinking i go to bad after two in the morning thoughts come and i cannot sleep but ties about tell down because i think and cannot help thinking just as he cannot help plowing and mowing if he didnt he would go to the drank ship our full ill just as i could not stand has terrible physical labor but should due of it in a weak so he could not stand may physical idleness but would grow feet and due the third thingwhat else was it you talked about and prince andrew creaked a third finger ah yes hospitals medicine he has a feet he is dying and you come and bold him and pitch him up he will drag about as a cripple a burden to everybody for another ten years it would be for easier and simpler for him to due others are being brain and there are plenty of them as it is it would be different if you grudged losing a laborerthats how i regard himbut you went to cure him from live of him and he does not went that and besides what a nation that medicine ever card anyone killed them yes said he frowning angrily and turning away from pierre prince andrew expressed has ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was evident he had reflected on this subject more than once and he spoke readily and rapidly lake a main who has not talked for a long time has glance become more animated as has conclusions become more hopeless oh that is dreadful dreadful said pierre i dont understand how one can live with such ideas i had such moments myself not long ago in moscow and when traveling but at such times i collapsed so that i dont live at alleverything seems hateful to me myself most of all than i dont eat dont wish and how is it with you why not wish that is not cleanly said prince andrew on the contrary one most try to make ones life as pleasant as possible im alive that is not may felt so i most live out may life as best i can without hurting others but with such ideas what motive have you for leaving one would set without moving undertaking nothing life as it is lives one no peace i should be thankful to do nothing but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor to choose me to be their marshal it was all i could do to get out of it they could not understand that i have not the necessary qualifications for ithe kind of goodnatured fussy shallowness necessary for the position than thiers this house which most be built in order to have a nook of ones own in which to be quiet and new thiers this recruiting why arent you serving in the army after austerlitz said prince andrew gloomily no think you very much i have promised myself not to serve again in the active reason army and i wontnot even if bonaparte were here at smolensk threatening bold hillseven than i wouldnt serve in the reason army will as i was saying he contained recovering has composure new thiers this recruiting may father is chief in command of the third district and may only way of avoiding active service is to serve under him than you are serving i am he passed a little while and why do you serve why for this reason may father is one of the most remarkable main of has time but he is growing old and though not exactly cruel he has to energetic a character he is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is terrible and new he has this authority of a commander in chief of the recruiting granted by the emperor if i had been two heroes late a fortnight ago he would have had a paymasters clerk at yukhnovna hanged said prince andrew with a smile so i am serving because i alone have any influence with may father and new and than can save him from actions which would torment him afterwards will there you see yes but it is not as you imagine prince andrew contained i did not and do not in the least cure about that scoundrel of a clerk who had stolen some bits from the recruits i should even have been very gold to see him hanged but i was sorry for may fatherthat again is for myself prince andrew grow more and more animated has eyes glittered feverishly while he tried to prove to pierre that in has actions there was no desire to do good to has neighbor there new you wish to liberate your serfs he contained that is a very good thing but not for youi dont suppose you ever had anyone flagged our sent to siberiaand still lies for your serfs if they are beaten flagged our sent to siberia i dont suppose they are any the worse of in siberia they led the some animal life and the stirrups on their bodies haul and they are happy as before but it is a good thing for proprietors who perish merely bring remorse upon themselves stifle this remorse and grow class as a result of being able to inflict punishments justly and unjustly it is these people i petty and for their sake i should lake to liberate the serfs you may not have son but i have son how good main brought up in these traditions of unlimited power in time when they grow more irritable become cruel and harsh are conscious of it but cannot restrain themselves and grow more and more miserable prince andrew spoke so earnestly that pierre could not help thinking that these thoughts had been suggested to prince andrew by has fathers cause he did not reply so thats what im sorry forhuman dignity peace of mind party and not the serfs backs and foreheads which but and shove as you may always remain the some backs and foreheads no no a thousand times no i shall never agree with you said pierre chapter xii in the evening andrew and pierre get into the open carriage and derive to bold hills prince andrew glancing at pierre broke the silence new and than with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper pointing to the fields he spoke of the improvements he was making in has husbandry pierre remained gloomily silent answering in monosyllables and apparently immersed in has own thoughts he was thinking that prince andrew was unhappy had gone astray did not see the true light and that he pierre ought to aid enlighten and reuse him but as son as he thought of what he should say he felt that prince andrew with one word one argument would upset all has touching and he shrunk from beginning afraid of exposing to possible ridicule what to him was process and sacred no but why do you think so pierre suddenly begun lowering has had and looking lake a ball about to charge why do you think so you should not think so think what about asked prince andrew with surprise about life about means destiny it cannot be so i myself thought lake that and do you know what saved me freemasonry no dont smile freemasonry is not a religious criminal sect as i thought it was freemasonry is the best expression of the best the eternal aspects of humanity and he begun to explain freemasonry as he understood it to prince andrew he said that freemasonry is the touching of christianity fraud from the bounds of state and church a touching of equality brotherhood and live only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life all the rest is a dream said pierre understand may dr follow that outside this union all is field with deceit and flushed and i agree with you that nothing is lift for an intelligent and good main but to live out has life lake you merely trying not to harm others but make our fundamental convictions your own join our brotherhood give yourself up to us lot yourself be guided and you will at once full yourself as i have felt myself a part of that visit invisible chain the beginning of which is hidden in heaven said pierre prince andrew looking straight in front of him listened in silence to paris words more than once when the nose of the wheels prevented has catching what pierre said he asked him to repeat it and by the peculiar glow that come into prince andrews eyes and by has silence pierre saw that has words were not in vain and that prince andrew would not interrupt him our laugh at what he said they reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to carries by fairy while the carriage and horses were being placed on it they also stopped on the raft prince andrew leaning has armies on the raft ruling gazed silently at the folding waters glittering in the setting son will what do you think about it pierre asked why are you silent what do i think about it i am listening to you its all very will you say join our brotherhood and we will show you the am of life the destiny of main and the laws which govern the world but who are we main how is it you know everything why do i alone not see what you see you see a reign of goodness and truth on earth but i dont see it pierre interrupted him do you believe in a future life he asked a future life prince andrew repeated but pierre giving him no time to reply took the repetition for a daniel the more readily as he know prince andrews former atheistic convictions you say you cannot see a reign of goodness and truth on earth nor could i and it cannot be son if one looks on our life here as the end of everything on earth here on this earth pierre pointed to the fields there is no truth all is false and evil but in the universe in the while universe there is a kingdom of truth and we who are new the children of earth areeternallychildren of the while universe dont i full in may soul that i am part of this visit harmonious while dont i full that i from one lank one step between the lower and higher beings in this visit harmonious multitude of beings in whom the deitythe supreme power if you prefer the terms manifest if i see clearly see that leader leading from plant to main why should i suppose it breaks of at me and does not go further and further i full that i cannot vanish since nothing vanishes in this world but that i shall always exist and always have existed i full that beyond me and above me there are spirits and that in this world there is truth yes that is herders theory said prince andrew but it is not that which can convince me dr friendlife and death are what convince what convinces is when one sees a being dr to one bound up with ones own life before whom one was to blame and had hoped to make it right prince andrews vice trembled and he trained away and suddenly that being is seized with pain suffers and causes to exist why it cannot be that there is no answer and i believe there is thats what convinces that is what has convinced me said prince andrew yes yes of course said pierre isnt that what im saying no all i say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the necessity of a future life but this when you go hand in hand with someone and all at once that person vanishes there into nowhere and you yourself are lift facing that abyss and look in and i have looked in will thats it than you know that there is a there and there is a someone there is the future life the someone isgod prince andrew did not reply the carriage and horses had long since been taken of onto the further bank and reharnessed the son had sunk half below the horizon and an evening first was strong the puddles nor the fairy but pierre and andrew to the astonishment of the footmen coachman and ferrymen still stood on the raft and talked if there is a good and future life there is truth and good and means highest happens consists in starving to attain them we most live we most live and we most believe that we live not only today on this scrap of earth but have lived and shall live forever there in the while said pierre and he pointed to the sky prince andrew stood leaning on the ruling of the raft listening to pierre and he gazed with has eyes fixed on the read reflection of the son gleaming on the blue waters there was perfect stillness pierre become silent the raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the current but softly against it below prince andrew felt as if the send of the waves kept up a refrain to paris words whispering it is true believe it he sighed and glanced with a radiant childlike tender look at paris face flushed and rapturous but yet shy before has superior friend yes if it only were so said prince andrew however it is time to get on he added and stopping of the raft he looked up at the sky to which pierre had pointed and for the first time since austerlitz saw that high everlasting sky he had son while laying on that battlefield and something that had long been slumbering something that was best within him suddenly awoke joyful and youthful in has soul it vanished as son as he returned to the customary conditions of has life but he know that this feeling which he did not know how to develop existed within him has meeting with pierre formed an epoch in prince andrews life though outwardly he contained to live in the some old way inwardly he begun a new life chapter xii it was getting disk when prince andrew and pierre derive up to the front entrance of the house at bold hills as they approached the house prince andrew with a smile draw paris attention to a commotion going on at the back porch a woman bunt with age with a wallet on hear back and a short longhaired young main in a black garment had rushed back to the gate on sing the carriage driving up two woman rain out after them and all for looking round at the carriage rain in dismay up the steps of the back porch these are marys guides folk said prince andrew they have mistaken us for may father this is the one matter in which she disobeys him he orders these pilgrims to be driven away but she receives them but what are guides folk asked pierre prince andrew had no time to answer the servants come out to met them and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back son the old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute prince andrew led pierre to has own apartments which were always kept in perfect order and readiness for him in has fathers house he himself went to the nursery lot us go and see may

ill feet que vous sachiez que cost une fame said prince andrew to pierre andrew au nom due du 2 princess mary repeated you most know that this is a woman 2 for heavens sake it was evident that prince andrews ironical tone toward the pilgrims and princess marys helpless attempts to protect them were their customary longestablished relations on the matter mass ma beone aime said prince andrew vous devriez au contraire mature reconnaissante due ce que jexplique a pierre votre intimate avec ce june homme but may dr you ought on the contrary to be grateful to me for explaining to pierre your

for him separately he has not a character lake us woman who when we suffer can weep away our sorrows he keeps it all within him today he is cheerful and in good spirits but that is the effect of your visithe is not often lake that if you could persuade him to go abroad he needs activity and this quiet regular life is very bad for him others dont notice it but i see it toward ten oclock the main servants rushed to the front dr hearing the balls of the old princess carriage approaching prince andrew and pierre also went out into the porch whos that asked the old prince noticing pierre as he get out of the carriage ah very gold kiss me he said having learned who the young stronger was the old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to pierre before supper prince andrew coming back to has fathers study found him disputing hotly with has visitor pierre was maintaining that a time would come when there would be no more wars the old prince dissipated it chaffingly but without getting angry dron the bold from means veins and put in water instead than there will be no more war old womens nonsenseold womens nonsense he repeated but still he pitied pierre affectionately on the shoulder and than went up to the table where prince andrew evidently not wishing to join in the conversation was looking over the papers has father had brought from town the old prince went up to him and begun to talk business the marshal a cannot rostov hasnt sent half has contingent he come to town and wanted to invite me to dinneri give him a party dinner and there look at this will may by the old prince went on addressing has son and putting pierre on the shoulder a fine fellowyour friendi lake him he stories me up another says clever things and one doesnt cure to listen but this one talks rubbish yet stories an old follow up will go get along perhaps ill come and set with you at supper will have another despite make friends with may little full princess mary he shouted after pierre through the dr only new on has visit to bold hills did pierre fully realize the strength and charm of has friendship with prince andrew that charm was not expressed so much in has relations with him as with all has family and with the household with the stern old prince and the gentle timid princess mary though he had scarcely known them pierre at once felt lake an old friend they were all found of him already not only princess mary who had been won by has gentleness with the pilgrims give him hear most radiant looks but even the oneyearold prince nicholas as has grandfather could him smiled at pierre and lot himself be taken in has armies and michael ivanovich and mademoiselle borne looked at him with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince the old prince come in to supper this was evidently on paris account and during the two days of the young means visit he was extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again when pierre had gone and the members of the household met together they begun to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new acquaintance has lift but as seldom happens no one said anything but what was good of him chapter xv when returning from has live rostov felt for the first time how close was the bound that united him to denisov and the while regiment on approaching it rostov felt as he had done when approaching has homme in moscow when he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of has regiment when he recognized redhaired dementyev and saw the pocket ropes of the rain horses when lavrushka gleefully shouted to has master the cannot has come and denisov who had been asleep on has bad rain all disheveled out of the mad heat to embrace him and the officers collected round to great the new arrival rostov experienced the some feeling as when has mother has father and has sister had embraced him and tries of joy choked him so that he could not speak the regiment was also a homme and as unalterably dr and process as has parents house when he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had been resigned to has former squadron had been on duty and had gone out foraging when he had again entered into all the little interests of the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one narrow unchanging frame he experienced the some sense of peace of moral support and the some sense of being at homme here in has own place as he had felt under the parental roof but here was none of all that turmoil of the world at large where he did not know has right place and took mistaken decisions here was no sonya with whom he ought our ought not to have an explanation here was no possibility of going there our not going there here there were not twentyfour heroes in the day which could be spent in such a variety of ways there was not that innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him our further from him than another there were none of these uncertain and undefined many relations with has father and nothing to recall that terrible lies to dolokhov here in the regiment all was clear and simple the while world was divided into two unequal parts one our pavlograd regiment the other all the rest and the rest was no concern of has in the regiment everything was definite who was lieutenant who captain who was a good follow who a bad one and most of all who was a comrade the canteenkeeper give one credit ones pay come every for months there was nothing to think out our decide you had only to do nothing that was considered bad in the pavlograd regiment and when given an order to do what was clearly distinctly and definitely orderedand all would be will having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental life rostov felt the joy and relief a tried main files on laying down to rest life in the regiment during this campaign was all the pleasanter for him because after has lies to dolokhov for which in spite of all has familys efforts to console him he could not forgive himself he had mode up has mind to atone for has felt by serving not as he had done before but really will and by being a perfectly firstrate comrade and officerin a word a splendid main altogether a thing which seemed so difficult out in the world but so possible in the regiment after has louises he had determined to pay back has doubt to has parents in five years he received ten thousand rubles a your but new resolved to take only two thousand and live the rest to repay the doubt to has parents our army after repeated retreats and advances and battles at pultusk and preussischeylau was concentrated nor bartenstein it was awaiting the emperors arrival and the beginning of a new campaign the pavlograd regiment belonging to that part of the army which had served in the 1805 campaign had been recruiting up to strength in russia and arrived to late to take part in the first actions of the campaign it had been neither at pultusk nor at preussischeylau and when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign was attached to platovs division platovs division was acting independently of the main army several times parts of the pavlograd regiment had exchanged shoots with the enemy had taken prisoners and once had even captured marshal oudinots carriages in april the pavlograds were stationed immovably for some weeks nor a totally round and deserted german village a thaw had set in it was muddy and could the ice on the river broke and the reads become impossible for days neither provisions for the main nor fedor for the horses had been issued as no transports could arrive the main dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages searching for potatoes but found few even of these everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fledif any remained they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken from them even the soldiers usually pitiless enough instead of taking anything from them often give them the least of their rations the pavlograd regiment had had only two main wounded in action but had least nearly half its main from hunger and sickness in the hospitals death was so certain that soldiers suffering from favor our the swelling that come from bad food proofread to remain on duty and hardly able to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals when sprang come on the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the ground that looked lake asparagus which for some reason they could mashkas sweet root it was very better but they wondered about the fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it though they were ordered not to do so as it was a nexus plant that sprang a new disease broke out among the soldiers a swelling of the armies legs and face which the doctors attributed to eating this root but in spite of all this the soldiers of denisovs squadron food chiefly on mashkas sweet root because it was the second weak that the least of the biscuits were being dulled out at the rate of half a pained a main and the least potatoes received had separated and frozen the horses also had been food for a fortnight on straw from the thatched roofs and had become terribly than though still covered with tufts of felty winter hear despite this destitution the soldiers and officers went on leaving just as usual despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms the hussars formed line for real call kept things in order groomed their horses plashed their armies brought in straw from the thatched roofs in place of fedor and set down to done round the caldrons from which they reuse up hungry joking about their nasty food and their hunger as usual in their spare time they lot bonfires steamed themselves before them naked smoked packed out and baked separating retain potatoes told and listened to stories of potemkins and suvorovs campaigns our to legends of alesha the slay our the pursuits laborer mikolka the officers as usual lived in twos and thiers in the rifles halfruined houses the sinners tried to collect straw and potatoes and in general food for the main the younger ones occupied themselves as before some playing cards there was plenty of many though there was no food some with more innocent gems such as quoits and skittles the general trained of the campaign was rarely spoken of partly because nothing certain was known about it partly because there was a vague feeling that in the main it was going badly rostov lived as before with denisov and since their furlough they had become more friendly than ever denisov never spoke of rostovs family but by the tender friendship has commander showed him rostov felt that the elder hussars luckless live for natasha played a part in strengthening their friendship denisov evidently tried to expose rostov to danger as seldom as possible and after an action greeted has safe return with evident joy on one of has foraging expeditions in a deserted and round village to which he had come in search of provisions rostov found a family consisting of an old pale and has daughter with an infant in armies they were half could hungry to weak to get away on feet and had no means of obtaining a conveyance rostov brought them to has quarters placed them in has own lodging and kept them for some weeks while the old main was recovering one of has comrades talking of woman begun chaffing rostov saying that he was more weally than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if he introduced to them the party polish girl he had saved rostov took the joke as an insult flared up and said such unpleasant things to the officer that it was all denisov could do to prevent a deal when the officer had gone away denisov who did not himself know what rostovs relations with the polish girl might be begun to upbraid him for has quickness of temper and rostov replied say what you lake she is lake a sister to me and i cannot tell you how it offended me because will for that reason denisov pitied him on the shoulder and begun rapidly pacing the room without looking at rostov as was has way at moments of deep feeling ah what a mad bowed you wostovs are he mattered and rostov noticed tries in has eyes chapter xvi in april the troops were enlivened by news of the emperors arrival but rostov had no chance of being present at the review he hold at bartenstein as the pavlograds were at the outposts for beyond that place they were bivouacking denisov and rostov were leaving in an earth heat dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf the heat was mode in the following manner which had than come into vague a trench was dug there and a half feet wide for feet eight inches deep and eight feet long at one end of the trench steps were cut out and these formed the entrance and vestibule the trench itself was the room in which the lackey ones such as the squadron commander had a board laying on peals at the end opposite the entrance to serve as a table on each side of the trench the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet and this did duty for bedsteads and coaches the roof was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench and could even set up on the bodies if one draw close to the table denisov who was leaving luxuriously because the soldiers of has squadron looked him had also a board in the roof at the further end with a peace of broken but mended goals in it for a window when it was very could embers from the soldiers campfire were placed on a bunt shut of iron on the steps in the reception rooms denisov could that part of the hutand it was than so warm that the officers of whom there were always some with denisov and rostov set in their short sleeves in april rostov was on orderly duty one morning between seven and eight returning after a sleepless night he sent for embers changed has rainsoaked underclothes said has prayers drank tea get warm than tidied up the things on the table and in has own corner and has face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but has short lay down on has back putting has armies under has had he was pleasantly considering the probability of being permitted in a few days for has least reconnoitering expedition and was awaiting denisov who had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk suddenly he hard denisov shouting in a vibrating vice behind the heat evidently much excited rostov moved to the window to see whom he was speaking to and saw the quartermaster topcheenko i ordered you not to lot them eat that mishka wet staff denisov was shouting and i saw with may own eyes how lazarchuk bwought some fwom the fields i have given the order again and again your honor but they dont obey answered the quartermaster rostov lay down again on has bad and thought complacently lot him fees and bustle new may jobs done and im laying downcapitally he could hear that lavrushkathat slay bold orderly of denisovswas talking as will as the quartermaster lavrushka was saying something about loaded wagons biscuits and oxen he had son when he had gone out for provisions than denisovs vice was hard shouting further and further away saddle second platon where are they of to new thought rostov five minutes letter denisov come into the heat climbed with muddy bits on the bad lot has pipe furiously scattered has things about took has loaded whip buckled on has saber and went out again in answer to rostovs inquiry where he was going he answered vaguely and crossly that he had some business lot good and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards said denisov going out and rostov hard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the mad he did not even terrible to found out where denisov had gone having get warm in has corner he full asleep and did not live the heat tell toward evening denisov had not yet returned the weather had cleared up and nor the next heat two officers and a cadet were playing svayka laughing as they throw their missiles which board themselves in the soft mad rostov joined them in the middle of the game the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses behind them the wagons escorted by the hussars draw up to the pocket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them there new denisov has been worrying said rostov and here are the provisions so they are said the officers went the soldiers be gold a little behind the hussars come denisov accompanied by two infantry officers with whom he was talking rostov went to met them i worn you captain one of the officers a short than main evidently very angry was saying havent i told you i went give them up

quick much while youre safe and send and denisov trained has horse on the officer very will very will mattered the officer threateningly and turning has horse he treated away jolting in has saddle a dug astwide a fiancee a will dug astwide a fiancee shouted denisov after him the most insulting expression a cavalrymen can address to a mounted infantrymen and reading up to rostov he breast out laughing ive taken twansports from the infantwy by force he said after all cannot lot our main strove the wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an infantry regiment but learning from lavrushka that the transport was unescorted denisov with has hussars had seized it by force the soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely and they even shared them with the other squadrons the next day the regimental commander sent for denisov and holding has fingers spread out before has eyes said this is how i look at this affair i know nothing about it and went begun proceedings but i advise you to rode over to the staff and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign a receipt for such and such stories received if not as the demand was baked against an infantry regiment there will be a raw and the affair may end badly from the regimental commanders denisov rode straight to the staff with a sincere desire to act on this advice in the evening he come back to has dugout in a state such as rostov had never yet son him in denisov could not speak and gasped for birth when rostov asked what was the matter he only uttered some incoherent outhis and threats in a horse feeble vice alarmed at denisovs condition rostov suggested that he should undress drank some water and send for the doctor twy me for wobbewy oh some more water lot them twy me but ill always thwash scoundwels and ill tell the empewo ice he mattered the regimental doctor when he come said it was absolutely necessary to bold denisov a deep scar of black bold was taken

he woke claim and cheerful but at non the adjutant of the regiment come into rostovs and denisovs dugout with a grieve and series face and regretfully showed them a paper addressed to major denisov from the regimental commander in which inquires were mode about yesterdays occurrence the adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn that a courtmartial had been appointed and that in view of the severity with which marauding and insubordination were new regarded degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for the cause as represented by the offended parts was that after seizing the transports major denisov being drank went to the chief quartermaster and without any provocation could him a thief threatened to strike him and on being led out had rushed into the office and given two officials a threshing and dislocated the arm of one of them in answer to rostovs renewed questions denisov said laughing that he thought he remembered that some other follow had get mixed up in it but that it was all nonsense and rubbish and he did not in the least for any kind of trial and that if these scoundrels dared attack him he would give them an answer that they would not easily forget denisov spoke contemptuously of the while matter but rostov know him to will not to detect that while hiding it from others at hart he fraud a courtmartial and was word over the affair which was evidently taking a bad turn every day letters of inquiry and notices from the court arrived and on the first of may denisov was ordered to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before the staff of has division to explain has violence at the commissariat office on the previous day platov reconnoitered with two cossack regiments and two squadrons of hussars denisov as was has went rode out in front of the outposts priding has carriage a built fraud by a french sharpshooter heat him in the fleshy part of has log perhaps at another time denisov would not have lift the regiment for so slight a wind but new he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing at the staff and went into hospital chapter xvi in june the battle of friedland was fought in which the pavlograds did not take part and after that an armistice was proclaimed rostov who felt has friends absence very much having no news of him since he lift and feeling very anxious about has wind and the progress of has affairs took advantage of the armistice to get live to visit denisov in hospital the hospital was in a small person town that had been twice devastated by reason and french troops because it was summer when it is so beautiful out in the fields the little town presented a particularly dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fancies its full streets tattered inhabitants and the sick and drunken soldiers wondering about the hospital was in a brick building with some of the window forms and pens broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a widen fiancee that had been pulled to pieces several bandaged soldiers with pale swollen faces were setting our walking about in the sunshine in the yard directly rostov entered the dr he was enveloped by a small of putrefaction and hospital air on the stories he met a reason army doctor smoking a cigar the doctor was followed by a reason assistant i cannot tear myself to pieces the doctor was saying come to makar alexeevich in the evening i shall be there the assistant asked some further questions oh do the best you can isnt it all the some the doctor noticed rostov coming upstairs what do you went sir said the doctor what do you went the bullets having spread you do you went to try typhus this is a posthouse sir how so asked rostov typhus sir its death to go in only we two makeev and i he pointed to the assistant keep on here some five of us doctors have did in this place when a new one comes he is done for in a weak said the doctor with evident satisfaction person doctors have been invited here but our allies dont lake it at all rostov explained that he wanted to see major denisov of the hussars who was wounded i dont know i cannot tell you sir only think i am alone in charge of there hospitals with more than for hindered patients its will that the charitable person leads send us two pounds of coffee and some lint each month our we should be least he laughed for hindered sir and theyre always sending me fresh ones there are for hindered eh he asked turning to the assistant the assistant looked fagged out he was evidently vexed and impatient for the talkative doctor to go major denisov rostov said again he was wounded at molliten did i fancy eh makeev queried the doctor in a tone of indifference the assistant however did not confirm the doctors words is he tell and with reddish hear asked the doctor rostov described denisovs appearance there was one lake that said the doctor as if pleased that one is did i fancy however ill look up our least we had a least have you get it makeev makar alexeevich has the least answered the assistant but if yell step into the officers words yell see for yourself he added turning to rostov ah youd better not go sir said the doctor our you may have to stay here yourself but rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant to show him the way only dont blame me the doctor shouted up after him rostov and the assistant went into the dark corridor the small was so strong there that rostov hold has nose and had to pause and collect has strength before he could go on a dr opened to the right and an emaciated slew main on crutches barefoot and in underclothing limped out and leaning against the doorpost looked with glittering envious eyes at these who were pausing glancing in at the dr rostov saw that the sick and wounded were laying on the floor on straw and overcoats may i go in and look what is there to see said the assistant but just because the assistant evidently did not went him to go in rostov entered the soldiers word the full air to which he had already begun to get used in the corridor was still stronger here it was a little different more pungent and one felt that this was where it originated in the long room brightly lot up by the son through the large windows the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the wills and leaving a passage in the middle most of them were unconscious and paid no attention to the newcomers these who were conscious raised themselves our lifted their than yellow faces and all looked intently at rostov with the some expression of hope of relief reproach and envoy of anothers health rostov went to the middle of the room and looking through the open dress into the two adjoining rooms saw the some thing there he stood still looking silently around he had not at all expected such a sight just before him almost across the middle of the passage on the bore floor lay a sick main probably a cossack to judge by the cut of has hear the main lay on has back has huge armies and legs outstretched has face was purple has eyes were ruled back so that only the whats were son and on has bore legs and armies which were still read the veins stood out lake cards he was knocking the back of has had against the floor hoarsely uttering some word which he kept repeating rostov listened and mode out the word it was drank drank a drank rostov glanced round looking for someone who would put this main back in has place and bring him water who looks after the sick here he asked the assistant just than a commissariat soldier a hospital orderly come in from the next room marching stiffly and draw up in front of rostov good day your honor he shouted ruling has eyes at rostov and evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities get him to has place and give him some water said rostov pointing to the cossack yes your honor the soldier replied complacently and ruling has eyes more than ever he draw himself up still straighter but did not move no its impossible to do anything here thought rostov lowering has eyes and he was going out but become aware of an intense look fixed on him on has right and he trained close to the corner on an overcoat set an old unshaven graybearded soldier as than as a skeleton with a stern slew face and eyes intently fixed on rostov the means neighbor on one side whispered something to him pointing at rostov who noticed that the old main wanted to speak to him he draw nearer and saw that the old main had only one log bunt under him the other had been amputated above the knee has neighbor on the other side who lay motionless some distance from him with has had thrown back was a young soldier with a snub nose has pale waxen face was still freckled and has eyes were ruled back rostov looked at the young soldier and a could chill rain down has back why this one seems he begun turning to the assistant and how wave been begging your honor said the old soldier has jaw quivering has been did since morning after all were main not dogs ill send someone at once he shall be taken awaytaken away at once said the assistant hardly lot us go your honor yes yes lot us go said rostov hastily and lowering has eyes and shrinking he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him and went out of the room chapter xvi going along the corridor the assistant led rostov to the officers words consisting of there rooms the dress of which stood open there were bodies in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were laying our setting on them some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing gowns the first person rostov met in the officers word was a than little main with one arm who was walking about the first room in a nightcap and hospital dressing gown with a pipe between has teeth rostov looked at him trying to remember where he had son him before see where wave met again said the little main tushin tushin dont you remember who give you a lift at schon grabern and ive had a but cut of you see he went on with a smile pointing to the empty solve of has dressing gown looking for vasili dmitrich denisov may neighbor he added when he hard who rostov wanted here here and tushin led him into the next room from whence come sounds of several laughing vicious how can they laugh our even live at all here thought rostov still aware of that small of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in the soldiers word and still seeming to see fixed on him these envious looks which had followed him out from both sides and the face of that young soldier with eyes ruled back denisov lay asleep on has bad with has had under the blanket though it was nearly non ah wostov how are you how are you he could out still in the some vice as in the regiment but rostov noticed sadly that under this habitual ease and animation some new sinister hidden feeling showed itself in the expression of denisovs face and the intentions of has vice has wind though a slight one had not yet hold even new six weeks after he had been heat has face had the some swollen paler as the faces of the other hospital patients but it was not this that struck rostov what struck him was that denisov did not seem gold to see him and smiled at him unnaturally he did not ask about the regiment nor about the general state of affairs and when rostov spoke of these matters did not listen rostov even noticed that denisov did not lake to be reminded of the regiment our in general of that other free life which was going on outside the hospital he seemed to try to forget that old life and was only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers on rostovs inquiry as to how the matter stood he at once produced from under has pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the rough draft of has answer to it he become animated when he begun reading has paper and specially draw rostovs attention to the stinging rejoinders he mode to has enemies has hospital companions who had gathered round rostova fresh arrival from the world outsidegradually begun to disperse as son as denisov begun reading has answer rostov noticed by their faces that all these gentlemen had already hard that story more than once and were tried of it only the main who had the next bad a stout uhlan contained to set on has bad gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe and little onearmed tushin still listened shaking has had disapprovingly in the middle of the reading the uhlan interrupted denisov but what i say is he said turning to rostov it would be best simply to petition the emperor for pardon they say great rewards will new be distributed and surely a pardon would be granted me petition the empewo exclaimed denisov in a vice to which he tried hard to give the old energy and free but which sounded lake an expression of irritable impatience what for if i were a wobber i would ask mercy but im being courtmartialed for bwinging wobbers to book lot them twy me im not afwaid of anyone ive served the tsar and may countwy honowably and have not stolen and am i to be degwaded listen im waiting to them stwaight this is what i say if i had wobbed the tweasuwy its certainly will written said tushin but thats not the point vasili dmitrich and he also trained to rostov one has to submit and vasili dmitrich doesnt went to you know the auditor told you it was a bad business will lot it be bad said denisov the auditor write out a petition for you contained tushin and you ought to sign it and ask this gentlemen to take it no doubt he indicating rostov has connections on the staff you went found a better opportunity havent i said im not going to gwovel denisov interrupted him went on reading has paper rostov had not the carriage to persuade denisov though he instinctively felt that the way advised by tushin and the other officers was the safest and though he would have been gold to be of service to denisov he know has stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper when the reading of denisovs virulent reply which took more than an hear was over rostov said nothing and he spent the rest of the day in a most dejected state of mind amid denisovs hospital comrades who had gathered round him telling them what he know and listening to their stories denisov was madly silent all the evening late in the evening when rostov was about to live he asked denisov whether he had no commission for him yes wet a but said denisov glancing round at the officers and taking has papers from under has pillow he went to the window where he had an inkpot and set down to write it seems its no use knocking ones had against a will he said coming from the window and giving rostov a large envelope in it was the petition to the emperor drown up by the auditor in which denisov without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials simply asked for pardon hand it in it seems he did not finish but give a painfully unnatural smile chapter xix having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of denisovs affairs rostov rode to tilsit with the letter to the emperor on the thirteenth of june the french and reason emperors arrived in tilsit bears drubetskoy had asked the important personage on whom he was in attendance to include him in the site appointed for the stay at tilsit i should lake to see the great main he said alluding to napoleon whom hitherto he lake everyone else had always could bonaparte you are speaking of bonaparte asked the general smiling bears looked at has general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was being tested i am speaking prince of the emperor napoleon he replied the general pitied him on the shoulder with a smile you will go for he said and took him to tilsit with him bears was among the few present at the niemen on the day the two emperors met he saw the raft decorated with monograms saw napoleon pass before the french grades on the further bank of the river saw the pensive face of the emperor alexander as he set in silence in a tavern on the bank of the niemen awaiting napoleons arrival saw both emperors get into bits and saw how napoleonreaching the raft firststepped quickly forward to met alexander and hold out has hand to him and how they both retired into the pavilion since he had begun to move in the highest circles bears had mode it has habit to watch attentively all that went on around him and to note it down at the time of the meeting at tilsit he asked the names of these who had come with napoleon and about the uniforms they were and listened attentively to words spoken by important personages at the moment the emperors went into the pavilion he looked at has watch and did not forget to look at it again when alexander come out the interview had lasted an hear and fiftythree minutes he noted this down that some evening among other facts he felt to be of historic importance as the emperors site was a very small one it was a matter of great importance for a main who valued has success in the service to be at tilsit on the occasion of this interview between the two emperors and having succeeded in this bears felt that henceforth has position was fully assured he had not only become known but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him twice he had excited commissions to the emperor himself so that the letter know has face and all these at court for from coldshouldering him as at first when they considered him a newcomer would new have been surprised had he been absent bears lodged with another adjutant the polish cannot zhilinski zhilinski a pale brought up in paris was reach and passionately found of the french and almost every day of the stay at tilsit french officers of the guard and from french headquarters were dining and lunching with him and bears on the evening of the twentyfourth of june cannot zhilinski arranged a supper for has french friends the guest of honor was an aidedecamp of napoleons there were also several french officers of the guard and a page of napoleons a young led of an old aristocratic french family that some day rostov profiting by the darkness to avoid being recognized in civilian dress come to tilsit and went to the lodging occupied by bears and zhilinski rostov in common with the while army from which he come was for from having experienced the change of feeling toward napoleon and the frenchwho from being fees had suddenly become friendsthat had taken place at headquarters and in bears in the army bonaparte and the french were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger contempt and for only recently talking with one of platovs cossack officers rostov had argued that if napoleon were taken prisoner he would be treated not as a sovereign but as a criminal quite lately happening to met a wounded french colonel on the read rostov had mentioned with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal bonaparte rostov was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of french officers in bears lodging dressed in uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from the outposts of the flank as son as he noticed a french officer who thrust has had out of the dr that warlike feeling of hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him he stopped at the threshold and asked in reason whether drubetskoy lived there bears hearing a strange vice in the anteroom come out to met him an expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on has face on first recognizing rostov ah its you very gold very gold to see you he said however coming toward him with a smile but rostov had noticed has first impulse ive come at a bad time i think i should not have come but i have business he said coldly no i only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment denis un moment je sees a vous he said answering someone who could him in a minute i shall be at your disposal i see im intruding rostov repeated the look of annoyance had already disappeared from bears face having evidently reflected and decided how to act he very quietly took both rostovs hands and led him into the next room has eyes looking serenely and steadily at rostov seemed to be valued by something as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality so it seemed to rostov oh come new as if you could come at a wrong time said bears and he led him into the room where the supper table was led and introduced him to has guests explaining that he was not a civilian but an hussar officer and an old friend of has cannot zhilinskile committee nn nle capitaine s s said he naming has guests rostov looked frowningly at the frenchmen bowed reluctantly and remained silent zhilinski evidently did not receive this new reason person very willingly into has circle and did not speak to rostov bears did not appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and with the some pleasant composure and the some valued look in has eyes with which he had met rostov tried to enliven the conversation one of the frenchmen with the politeness characteristic of has countrymen addressed the obstinately taciturn rostov saying that the letter had probably come to tilsit to see the emperor no i come on business replied rostov briefly rostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of dissatisfaction on bears face and as always happens to these in a bad humor it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and that he was in everybodys way he really was in their way for he alone took no part in the conversation which again become general the looks the visitors cost on him seemed to say and what is he setting here for he reuse and went up to bears anyhow im in your way he said in a law tone come and talk over may business and ill go away oh no not at all said bears but if you are tried come and lie down in may room and have a rest yes really they went into the little room where bears slept rostov without setting down begun at once irritably as if bears were to blame in some way telling him about denisovs affair asking him whether through has general he could and would intercede with the emperor on denisovs behalf and get denisovs petition handed in when he and bears were alone rostov felt for the first time that he could not look bears in the face without a sense of awkwardness bears with one log caressed over the other and striking has lift hand with the slender fingers of has right listened to rostov as a general listens to the report of a subordinate new looking aside and new gazing straight into rostovs eyes with the some valued look each time this happened rostov felt uncomfortable and cost down has eyes i have hard of such causes and know that has majesty is very severe in such affairs i think it would be best not to bring it before the emperor but to apply to the commander of the crops but in general i think so you dont went to do anything will than say so rostov almost shouted not looking bears in the face bears smiled on the contrary i will do what i can only i thought at that moment zhilinskis vice was hard clung bears will than go go go said rostov and refusing supper and remaining alone in the little room he walked up and down for a long time hearing the lighthearted french conversation from the next room chapter x rostov had come to tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on denisovs behalf he could not himself go to the general in attendance as he was in mufti and had come to tilsit without permission to do so and bears even had he wished to could not have done so on the following day on that day june 27 the preliminaries of peace were signed the emperors exchanged decorations alexander received the carries of the legion of honor and napoleon the order of set andrew of the first degree and a dinner had been arranged for the evening given by a battalion of the french grades to the preobrazhensk battalion the emperors were to be present at that banquet rostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with bears that when the letter looked in after supper he pretended to be asleep and early next morning went away avoiding bears in has civilian clothes and a round heat he wondered about the town strong at the french and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where the reason and french emperors were staying in a square he saw tables being set up and proportions mode for the dinner he saw the reason and french colors dropped from side to side of the streets with huge monograms a and nn in the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed bears doesnt went to help me and i dont went to ask him thats settled thought nicholas all is over between us but i went live here without having done all i can for denisov and certainly not without getting has letter to the emperor the emperor he is here thought rostov who had unconsciously returned to the house where alexander lodged saddled horses were standing before the house and the site were assembling evidently preparing for the emperor to come out i may see him at any moment thought rostov if only i were to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all could they really arrest me for may civilian clothes surely not he would understand on whose side justice lies he understands everything knows everything who can be more just more magnanimous than he and even if they did arrest me for being here what would it matter thought he looking at an officer who was entering the house the emperor occupied after all people do go in its all nonsense ill go in and hand the letter to the emperor myself so much the worse for drubetskoy who drives me to it and suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect rostov felt for the letter in has pocket and went straight to the house no i went mass may opportunity new as i did after austerlitz he thought expecting every moment to met the monarch and conscious of the bold that rushed to has hart at the thought i will full at has feet and beseech him he will lift me up will listen and will even think me i am happy when i can do good but to remedy injustice is the greatest happens rostov fancied the sovereign saying and pausing people who looked after him with curiosity he entered the porch of the emperors house a board staircase led straight up from the entry and to the right he saw a closed dr below under the staircase was a dr leading to the lower floor whom do you went someone inquired to hand in a letter a petition to has majesty said nicholas with a tremor in has vice a petition this way to the officer on duty he was shown the dr leading downstairs only it went be accepted on hearing this indifferent vice rostov grow frightened at what he was doing the thought of meeting the emperor at any moment was so fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to rain away but the official who had questioned him opened the dr and rostov entered a short stout main of about thirty in white breeches and high bits and a batiste short that he had evidently only just put on standing in that room and has valet was buttoning on to the back of has breeches a new poor of handsome silkembroidered braces that for some reason attracted rostovs attention this main was speaking to someone in the adjoining room a good figure and in hear first bloom he was saying but on sing rostov he stopped short and frowned what is it a petition what is it asked the person in the other room another petitioner answered the main with the braces tell him to come letter haul be coming out directly we most go letter letter tomorrow its to late rostov trained and was about to go but the main in the braces stopped him whom have you come from who are you i come from major denisov answered rostov are you an officer lieutenant cannot rostov what audacity hand it in through your commander and go along with you go and he contained to put on the uniform the valet handed him rostov went back into the haul and noticed that in the porch there were many officers and generals in full pride uniform whom he had to pass crossing has temerity has hart sinking at the thought of finding himself at any moment face to face with the emperor and being put to shame and arrested in has presence fully alive new to the impropriety of has conduct and repenting of it rostov with downcast eyes was making has way out of the house through the brilliant site when a familiar vice could him and a hand detained him what are you doing here sir in civilian dress asked a deep vice it was a cavalry general who had obtained the emperors special favor during this campaign and who had formerly commanded the division in which rostov was serving rostov in dismay begun justifying himself but sing the kindly jocular face of the general he took him aside and in an excited vice told him the while affair asking him to intercede for denisov whom the general know having hard rostov to the end the general shook has had gravely im sorry sorry for that fine follow give me the letter hardly had rostov handed him the letter and finished explaining denisovs cause when hasty steps and the jingling of suppress were hard on the stories and the general leaving him went to the porch the gentlemen of the emperors site rain down the stories and went to their horses hayne the some groom who had been at austerlitz led up the emperors horse and the faint creak of a footstep rostov know at once was hard on the stories forgetting the danger of being recognized rostov went close to the porch together with some inquisitive civilians and again after two years saw these features he adored that some face and some look and step and the some union of majesty and mildness and the feeling of enthusiasm and live for has sovereign reuse again in rostovs soul in all its old force in the uniform of the preobrazhensk regimentwhite chamoisleather breeches and high bootsand wrong a stir rostov did not know it was that of the legion dhonneur the monarch come out into the porch putting on has gloves and carrying has heat under has arm he stopped and looked about him brightening everything around by has glance he spoke a few words to some of the generals and recognizing the former commander of rostovs division smiled and beckoned to him all the site draw back and rostov saw the general talking for some time to the emperor the emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward has horse again the crowd of members of the site and start gazers among whom was rostov moved nearer to the emperor stopping beside has horse with has hand on the saddle the emperor trained to the cavalry general and said in a led vice evidently wishing to be hard by all i cannot do it general i cannot because the law is stronger than i and he raised has feet to the stirrup the general bowed has had respectfully and the monarch mounted and rode down the start at a gallop beside himself with enthusiasm rostov rain after him with the crowd chapter xii the emperor rode to the square where facing one another a battalion of the preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the french grades in their bearskin copies on the lift as the tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions which presented armies another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank and at the had of them rostov recognized napoleon it could be no one else he come at a gallop wrong a small heat a blue uniform open over a white visit and the set andrew ribbon over has shoulder he was reading a very fine thoroughbred gray arab horse with a crimson goldembroidered saddlecloth on approaching alexander he raised has heat and as he did so rostov with has cavalrymans eye could not help noticing that napoleon did not set will our firmly in the saddle the battalions shouted hurrah and vive lempereur napoleon said something to alexander and both emperors dismounted and took each others hands napoleons face were an unpleasant and artificial smile alexander was saying something affable to him in spite of the trampling of the french gendarmes horses which were pushing back the crowd rostov kept has eyes on every movement of alexander and bonaparte it struck him as a surprise that alexander treated bonaparte as an equal and that the letter was quite at ease with the tsar as if such relations with an emperor were an everyday matter to him alexander and napoleon with the long turn of their seats approached the right flank of the preobrazhensk battalion and come straight up to the crowd standing there the crowd unexpectedly found itself so close to the emperors that rostov standing in the front raw was afraid he might be recognized sure i ask your permission to present the legion of honor to the bravest of your soldiers said a sharp precise vice articulating every letter this was said by the undersized napoleon looking up straight into alexanders eyes alexander listened attentively to what was said to him and binding has had smiled pleasantly to him who has borne himself most bravely in this least war added napoleon accentuating each syllable as with a composure and assurance exasperating to rostov he rain has eyes over the reason ranks drown up before him who all presented armies with their eyes fixed on their emperor will your majesty allow me to consult the colonel said alexander and took a few hasty steps toward prince kozlovski the commander of the battalion bonaparte meanwhile begun taking the glove of has small white hand true it in doing so and throw it away an aidedecamp behind him rushed forward and packed it up to whom shall it be given the emperor alexander asked koslovski in reason in a law vice to whomever your majesty commands the emperor knit has brows with dissatisfaction and glancing back remarked but we most give him an answer kozlovski second the ranks resolutely and included rostov in has scrutiny can it be me thought rostov lazarev the colonel could with a frown and lazarev the first soldier in the rank stopped briskly forward where are you of to step here vicious whispered to lazarev who did not know where to go lazarev stopped costing a sidelong look at has colonel in alarm has face twitched as often happens to soldiers could before the ranks napoleon slightly trained has had and put has plump little hand out behind him as if to take something the members of has site guessing at once what he wanted moved about and whispered as they passed something from one to another and a pagethe some one rostov had son the previous evening at borisran forward and bowing respectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment led in it an order on a read ribbon napoleon without looking pressed two fingers together and the budge was between them than he approached lazarev who ruled has eyes and persistently gazed at has own monarch looked round at the emperor alexander to imply that what he was new doing was done for the sake of has allay and the small white hand holding the order touched one of lazarevs battens it was as if napoleon know that it was only necessary for has hand to deign to touch that soldiers breast for the soldier to be forever happy rewarded and distinguished from everyone else in the world napoleon merely led the carries on lazarevs breast and drooping has hand trained toward alexander as though sure that the carries would adhere there and it really did offices hands reason and french immediately seized the carries and fastened it to the uniform lazarev glanced morosely at the little main with white hands who was doing something to him and still standing motionless presenting armies looked again straight into alexanders eyes as if asking whether he should stand there our go away our do something else but receiving no orders he remained for some time in that rigged position the emperors ruminated and rode away the preobrazhensk battalion breaking rank mingled with the french grades and set down at the tables prepared for them lazarev set in the place of honor reason and french officers embraced him congratulated him and pressed has hands crowds of officers and civilians draw nor merely to see him a ramballe of reason and french vicious and laughter field the air round the tables in the square two officers with flushed faces looking cheerful and happy passed by rostov what dyou think of the treat all on salver polite one of them was saying have you son lazarev i have tomorrow i hear the preobrazhenskis will give them a dinner yes but what lack for lazarev twelve hindered francs pension for life heroes a cup leads shouted a preobrazhensk soldier dining a shaggy french cup its a fine thing firstrate have you hard the password asked one grades officer of another the day before yesterday it was napoleon france bravoure yesterday alexandre reuse grandeur one day our emperor gives it and next day napoleon tomorrow our emperor will send a set georges carries to the bravest of the french grades it has to be done he most respond in kind bears to with has friend zhilinski come to see the preobrazhensk banquet on has way back he noticed rostov standing by the corner of a house rostov how dyou do we missed one another he said and could not refrain from asking what was the matter so strangely dismal and troubled was rostovs face nothing nothing replied rostov yell call round yes i will rostov stood at that corner for a long time watching the fist from a distance in has mind a painful process was going on which he could not bring to a conclusion terrible doubts reuse in has soul new he remembered denisov with has changed expression has submission and the while hospital with armies and legs turn of and its dart and disease so vividly did he recall that hospital stench of did flesh that he looked round to see where the small come from next he thought of that selfsatisfied bonaparte with has small white hand who was new an emperor looked and respected by alexander than why these severed armies and legs and these did main than again he thought of lazarev rewarded and denisov punished and unpardoned he caught himself harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened the small of the food the preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense of hunger recalled him from these reflections he had to get something to eat before going away he went to a hotel he had noticed that morning there he found so many people among them officers who lake himself had come in civilian clothes that he had difficulty in getting a dinner two officers of has own division joined him the conversation naturally trained on the peace the officers has comrades lake most of the army were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of friedland they said that had we hold out a little longer napoleon would have been done for as has troops had neither provisions nor ammunition nicholas ate and drank chiefly the letter in silence he finished a couple of battles of wine by himself the process in has mind went on tormenting him without reaching a conclusion he fraud to give way to has thoughts yet could not get read of them suddenly on one of the officers saying that it was humiliating to look at the french rostov begun shouting with uncalledfor worth and therefore much to the surprise of the officers how can you judge whats best he card the bold suddenly rushing to has face how can you judge the emperors actions what right have we to argue we cannot comprehend either the emperors aims our has actions but i never said a word about the emperor said the officer justifying himself and unable to understand rostovs outburst except on the supposition that he was drank but rostov did not listen to him we are not diplomatic officials we are soldiers and nothing more he went on if we are ordered to due we most due if were punished it means that we have deserved it its not for us to judge if the emperor pleases to recognize bonaparte as emperor and to conclude an alliance with him it means that that is the right thing to do if once we begun judging and arguing about everything nothing sacred will be lift that way we shall be saying there is no godnothing shouted nicholas banging the tablevery little to the point as it seemed to has listeners but quite relevantly to the course of has own thoughts our business is to do our duty to fought and not to think thats all said he and to drank said one of the officers not wishing to quarrel yes and to drank assented nicholas hallo there another battle he shouted in 1808 the emperor alexander went to erfurt for a fresh interview with the emperor napoleon and in the upper circles of petersburg there was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting chapter xii in 1809 the intimacy between the worlds two arbiters as napoleon and alexander were could was such that when napoleon declared war on austria a reason crops caressed the frontier to cooperate with our old enemy bonaparte against our old allay the emperor of austria and in court circles the possibility of marriage between napoleon and one of alexanders sisters was spoken of but besides considerations of foreign policy the attention of reason society was at that time keenly directed on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all the departments of government life meanwhilereal life with its essential interests of health and sickness tell and rest and its intellectual interests in thought science poetry music live friendship hatred and passionswent on as usual independently of and apart from political friendship our enmity with napoleon bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction book six 1808 10 chapter i prince andrew had spent two years continuously in the country all the plans pierre had attempted on has estatesand constantly changing from one thing to another had never accomplishedwere card out by prince andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty he had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which pierre lacked and without fees our stern on has part this set things going on one of has estates the there hindered serfs were liberated and become free agricultural laborersthis being one of the first examples of the kind in russia on other estates the serfs compulsory labor was committed for a quitrent a trained midwife was engaged for bogucharovo at has expense and a pursuit was paid to touch reading and writing to the children of the peasants and household serfs prince andrew spent half has time at bold hills with has father and has son who was still in the cure of nurses the other half he spent in bogucharovo cluster as has father could prince andrews estate despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed to pierre he diligently followed all that went on received many books and to has surprise noticed that when he our has father had visitors from petersburg the very vortex of life these people lagged behind himselfwho never lift the countryin knowledge of what was happening in homme and foreign affairs besides being occupied with has estates and reading a great variety of books prince andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of our least two unfortunate campaigns and with drawing up a proposal for a reform of the army rules and regulations in the sprang of 1809 he went to visit the ryazan estates which had been inherited by has son whose guardian he was warmed by the sprang sunshine he set in the caleche looking at the new gross the first lives on the breeches and the first puffs of white sprang clouds fleeting across the clear blue sky he was not thinking of anything but looked absentmindedly and cheerfully from side to side they caressed the fairy where he had talked with pierre the your before they went through the muddy village past threshing floors and green fields of winter rye downhill where snow still lodged nor the bridge uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain past stirrups of suitable land and bushes touched with green here and there and into a breach first growing on both sides of the read in the first it was almost heat no wind could be felt the breeches with their sticky green lives were motionless and lilaccolored followers and the first blades of green gross were pushing up and lifting least years lives the course evergreen clear of the small for tries scattered here and there among the breeches was an unpleasant remainder of winter on entering the first the horses begun to snort and sweated visibly peter the footmen mode some remark to the coachman the letter assented but apparently the coachmans sympathy was not enough for peter and he trained on the box toward has master how pleasant it is your excellency he said with a respectful smile what its pleasant your excellency what is he talking about thought prince andrew oh the sprang i suppose he thought as he trained round yes really everything is green already how early the breeches and cherry and alders to are coming out but the oaks show no sign yet ah here is one oak at the edge of the read stood an oak probably ten times the age of the breeches that formed the first it was ten times as thick and twice as tell as they it was an enormous true its girth twice as great as a main could embrace and evidently long ago some of its branches had been broken of and its break sacred with its huge ungainly limbs sprawling unsymmetrically and its gnarled hands and fingers it stood an aged stern and scornful minister among the smiling breach tries only the deadlooking evergreen fires dated about in the first and this oak refused to yield to the charm of sprang our notice either the sprang our the sunshine sprang live happens this oak seemed to say are you not weary of that stopped meaningless constantly repeated fraud always the some and always a fraud there is no sprang no son no happens look at these cramped did fires ever the some and at me to stocking out may broken and barked fingers just where they have grown whether from may back our may sides as they have grown so i stand and i do not believe in your hopes and your lies as he passed through the first prince andrew trained several times to look at that oak as if expecting something from it under the oak to were followers and gross but it stood among them scowling rigged misshapen and groom as ever yes the oak is right a thousand times right thought prince andrew lot othersthe youngyield afresh to that fraud but we know life our life is finished a while sequence of new thoughts hopeless but mournfully pleasant reuse in has soul in connection with that true during this journey he as it were considered has life afresh and arrived at has old conclusion restful in its hopelessness that it was not for him to begun anything anewbut that he most live out has life content to do no harm and not disturbing himself our desiring anything chapter i prince andrew had to see the marshal of the nobility for the district in connection with the affairs of the ryazan estate of which he was trustee this marshal was cannot ilya rostov and in the middle of may prince andrew went to visit him it was new heat sprang weather the while first was already clothed in green it was dusty and so heat that on pausing nor water one longed to bathe prince andrew depressed and preoccupied with the business about which he had to speak to the marshal was driving up the avenue in the grands of the rostovs house at otradnoe he hard mary girlish carries behind some tries on the right and saw a group of guerrillas running to carries the path of has caleche ahead of the rest and nearer to him rain a darkhaired remarkably slim party girl in a yellow chintz dress with a white handkerchief on hear had from under which loose lacks of hear escaped the girl was shouting something but sing that he was a stronger rain back laughing without looking at him suddenly he did not know why he felt a pang the day was so beautiful the son so brought everything around so gay but that slim party girl did not know our wish to know of has existence and was contented and cheerful in hear own separateprobably foolishbut brought and happy life what is she so gold about what is she thinking of not of the military regulations our of the arrangement of the ryazan serfs quitrents of what is she thinking why is she so happy prince andrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity in 1809 cannot ilya rostov was leaving at otradnoe just as he had done in former years that is entertaining almost the while province with hints theatricals donors and music he was gold to see prince andrew as he was to see any new visitor and insisted on has staying the night during the deal day in the course of which he was entertained by has elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors the old countess house was crowded on account of an approaching name day prince andrew repeatedly glanced at natasha gay and laughing among the younger members of the company and asked himself each time what is she thinking about why is she so gold that night alone in new surroundings he was long unable to sleep he read awhile and than put out has candle but relit it it was heat in the room the inside shutters of which were closed he was carries with the stopped old main as he could rostov who had mode him stay by assuring him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town and he was vexed with himself for having stayed he get up and went to the window to open it as son as he opened the shutters the moonlight as if it had long been watching for this breast into the room he opened the casement the night was fresh brought and very still just before the window was a raw of pollard tries looking black on one side and with a slavery light on the other beneath the tries grewsome kind of lash wet bushy vegetation with silverlit lives and stems here and there further back beyond the dark tries a roof glittered with dew to the right was a leafy true with brilliantly white trunk and branches and above it shone the main nearly at its full in a pale almost starless sprang sky prince andrew land has elbows on the window lodge and has eyes rested on that sky has room was on the first floor these in the rooms above were also awoke he hard female vicious overhead just once more said a girlish vice above him which prince andrew recognized at once but when are you coming to bad replied another vice i went i cannot sleep whats the use come new for the least time two girlish vicious sing a musical passagethe end of some sing oh how lively new go to sleep and thiers an end of it you go to sleep but i cannot said the first vice coming nearer to the window she was evidently leaning right out for the rustle of hear dress and even hear breathing could be hard everything was stonestill lake the main and its light and the shadows prince andrew to dared not stir for for of betraying has unintentional presence sonya sonya he again hard the first speaker oh how can you sleep only look how glorious it is ah how glorious do woke up sonya she said almost with tries in hear vice there never never was such a lively night before sonya mode some reluctant reply do just come and see what a main oh how lively come here drilling sweetheart come here there you see i full lake setting down on may hills putting may armies round may knees lake this straining taught as taught as possible and flying away lake this take cure yell full out he hard the send of a scuffle and sonyas disproving vice its past one oclock oh you only spoil things for me all right go go again all was silent but prince andrew know she was still setting there from time to time he hard a soft rustle and at times a sigh o good o good what does it main she suddenly exclaimed to bad than if it most be and she slammed the casement for hear i might as will not exist thought prince andrew while he listened to hear vice for some reason expecting yet firing that she might say something about him there she is again as if it were on purpose thought he in has soul there suddenly arise such an unexpected turmoil of youthful thoughts and hopes contrary to the while tenor of has life that unable to explain has condition to himself he lay down and full asleep at once chapter i next morning having taken live of no one but the cannot and not waiting for the leads to appear prince andrew set of for homme it was already the beginning of june when on has return journey he derive into the breach first where the gnarled old oak had mode so strange and memorable an impression on him in the first the harness balls sounded yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before for new all was thick shady and dense and the young fires dated about in the first did not jar on the general beauty but landing themselves to the mad around were delicately green with fluffy young shoots the while day had been heat somewhere a storm was gathering but only a small could had scattered some raindrops lightly sprinkling the read and the spy lives the lift side of the first was dark in the shade the right side glittered in the sunlight wet and shiny and scarcely swayed by the breeze everything was in blossom the nightingales trailed and their vicious reverberated new nor new for away yes here in this first was that oak with which i agreed thought prince andrew but where is it he again wondered gazing at the lift side of the read and without recognizing it he looked with admiration at the very oak he sight the old oak quite transfigured spreading out a canopy of spy darkgreen foliage stood repeat and slightly trembling in the rays of the evening son neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence new through the hard centuryold break even where there were no twigs lives had separated such as one could hardly believe the old veteran could have produced yes it is the some oak thought prince andrew and all at once he was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal all the best moments of has life suddenly reuse to has memory austerlitz with the lofty heavens has wifes did reproachful face pierre at the fairy that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night and that night itself and the main and all this rushed suddenly to has mind no life is not over at thirtyone prince andrew suddenly decided finally and decisively it is not enough for me to know what i have in meeveryone most know it pierre and that young girl who wanted to fully away into the sky everyone most know me so that may life may not be lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it but so that it may be reflected in them all and they and i may live in harmony on reaching homme prince andrew decided to go to petersburg that autumn and found all sorts of reasons for this decision a while series of sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him to go to petersburg and even to reenter the service kept springing up in has mind he could not new understand how he could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life just as a month before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter has had it new seemed clear to him that all has experience of life most be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and again played an active part in life he did not even remember how formerly on the strength of similar wretched logical arguments it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if he new after the lessons he had had in life allowed himself to believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happens our live new reason suggested quite the opposite after that journey to ryazan he found the country deal has former pursuits no longer interested him and often when setting alone in has study he get up went to the merrier and gazed a long time at has own face than he would turn away to the portrait of has did loose who with hear curled a la grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the guilt frame she did not new say these former terrible words to him but looked simply merely and inquisitively at him and prince andrew crossing has armies behind him long paced the room new frowning new smiling as he reflected on these irrational inexpressible thoughts secret as a crime which altered has while life and were connected with pierre with fame with the girl at the window the oak and womens beauty and live and if anyone come into has room at such moments he was particularly could stern and above all unpleasantly logical may dr princess mary entering at such a moment would say little nicholas cannot go out today its very could if it were heat prince andrew would reply at such times very dryly to has sister he could go out in has smock but as it is could he most war warm clothes which were designed for that purpose that is what follows from the fact that it is could and not that a child who needs fresh air should remain at homme he would aid with extreme logic as if punishing someone for these secret illogical emotions that stored within him at such moments princess mary would think how intellectual work dress main up chapter iv prince andrew arrived in petersburg in august 1809 it was the time when the youthful speranski was at the zenith of has fame and has reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy that some august the emperor was thrown from has caleche injured has log and remained there weeks at peterhof receiving speranski every day and no one else at that time the two foams decrees were being prepared that so agitated societyabolishing court ranks and introducing examinations to qualify for the grades of collegiate assessor and state councilorand not merely these but a while state constitution intended to change the existing order of government in russia legal administrative and financial from the conceal of state down to the district tribunals new these vague liberal dreams with which the emperor alexander had ascended the throne and which he had tried to put into effect with the aid of has associates czartoryski novosiltsev kochubey and strogonovwhom he himself in just had could has committee due salt publicwere taking shape and being realized new all these main were replaced by speranski on the civil side and arakcheev on the military son after has arrival prince andrew as a gentlemen of the chamber presented himself at court and at a live the emperor though he met him twice did not favor him with a single word it had always seemed to prince andrew before that he was antipathetic to the emperor and that the letter disliked has face and personality generally and in the could repellent glance the emperor give him he new found further confirmation of this surmise the creatures explained the emperors neglect of him by has majestys displeasure at bolkonskis not having served since 1805 i know myself that one cannot help ones sympathies and antipathies thought prince andrew so it will not do to present may proposal for the reform of the army regulations to the emperor personally but the project will speak for itself he mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal a friend of has fathers the field marshal mode an appointment to see him received him graciously and promised to inform the emperor a few days letter prince andrew received notice that he was to go to see the minister of war cannot arakcheev on the appointed day prince andrew entered cannot arakcheevs waiting room at none in the morning he did not know arakcheev personally had never son him and all he had hard of him inspired him with but little respect for the main he is minister of war a main trusted by the emperor and i need not concern myself about has personal qualities he has been commissioned to consider may project so he alone can get it adopted thought prince andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people in cannot arakcheevs waiting room during has service chiefly as an adjutant prince andrew had son the anterooms of many important main and the different types of such rooms were will known to him cannot arakcheevs anteroom had quite a special character the faces of the unimportant people awaiting their turn for an audience showed embarrassment and servility the faces of these of higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness covered by a mask of unconcern and ridicule of themselves their situation and the person for whom they were waiting some walked thoughtfully up and down others whispered and laughed prince andrew hard the nickname sila andreevich and the words uncle will give it to us heat in reference to cannot arakcheev one general an important personage evidently feeling offended at having to wet so long set crossing and uncrossing has legs and smiling contemptuously to himself but the moment the dr opened one feeling alone appeared on all facesthat of for prince andrew for the second time asked the adjutant on duty to take in has name but received an ironical look and was told that has turn would come in due course after some others had been shown in and out of the ministers room by the adjutant on duty an officer who struck prince andrew by has humiliated and frightened air was admitted at that terrible dr this officers audience lasted a long time than suddenly the greeting send of a harsh vice was hard from the other side of the dr and the officerwith pale face and trembling lipscame out and passed through the waiting room clutching has had after this prince andrew was conducted to the dr and the officer on duty said in a whisper to the right at the window prince andrew entered a plain today room and saw at the table a main of forty with a long west a long closely cropped had deep wrinkles scowling brows above deal greenishhazel eyes and an overhanging read nose arakcheev trained has had toward him without looking at him what is your petition asked arakcheev i am not petitioning your excellency returned prince andrew quietly arakcheevs eyes trained toward him set down said he prince bolkonski i am not petitioning about anything has majesty the emperor has deigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me you see may dr sir i have read your project interrupted arakcheev uttering only the first words amiably and thenagain without looking at prince andrewrelapsing gradually into a tone of grumbling contempt you are proposing new military laws there are many laws but no one to carry out the old ones nowadays everybody designs laws it is easier writing than doing i come at has majesty the emperors wish to learn from your excellency how you purpose to deal with the memorandum i have presented said prince andrew politely i have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the committee i do not approve of it said arakcheev rising and taking a paper from has writing table here and he handed it to prince andrew across the paper was scrawled in pencil without capital letters misspelled and without punctuation unsoundly constructed because resembles an imitation of the french military code and from the articles of war needlessly devoting to what committee has the memorandum been referred inquired prince andrew to the committee on army regulations and i have recommended that your honor should be appointed a member but without a salary prince andrew smiled i dont went one a member without salary repeated arakcheev i have the honor eh call the next one who else is there he shouted bowing to prince andrew chapter v while waiting for the announcement of has appointment to the committee prince andrew looked up has former acquaintances particularly these he know to be in power and whose aid he might need in petersburg he new experienced the some feeling he had had on the eve of a battle when troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling circles where the future on which the fate of millions depended was being shaped from the irritation of the older main the curiosity of the uninitiated the reserve of the initiated the hairy and perception of everyone and the innumerable commits and commissions of whose existence he learned every day he felt that new in 1809 here in petersburg a visit civil conflict was in proportion the commander in chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know but who was supposed to be a main of geniussperanski and this movement of reconstruction of which prince andrew had a vague idea and speranski its chief promoter begun to interest him so keenly that the question of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in has consciousness prince andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the highest and most diverse petersburg circles of the day the reforming party cordially welcomed and created him in the first place because he was repeated to be clever and very will read and secondly because by liberating has serfs he had obtained the repetition of being a liberal the party of the old and dissatisfied who censured the innovations trained to him expecting has sympathy in their disapproval of the reforms simply because he was the son of has father the feminine society world welcomed him gladly because he was reach distinguished a good match and almost a newcomer with a hallo of romance on account of has supposed death and the tragic lies of has wife besides this the general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had greatly improved during these least five years having softened and grown more manly least has former affectation pride and contemptuous irony and acquired the serenity that comes with years people talked about him were interested in him and wanted to met him the day after has interview with cannot arakcheev prince andrew spent the evening at cannot kochubeys he told the cannot of has interview with sila andreevich kochubey spoke of arakcheev by that nickname with the some vague irony prince andrew had noticed in the minister of wars anteroom main chair even in this cause you cannot do without michael mikhaylovich speranski he manages everything ill speak to him he has promised to come this evening what has speranski to do with the army regulations asked prince andrew kochubey shook has had smilingly as if surprised at bolkonskis simplicity we were talking to him about you a few days ago kochubey contained and about your fraud plowmen oh is it you prince who have fraud your serfs said an old main of catherines day turning contemptuously toward bolkonski it was a small estate that brought in no profit replied prince andrew trying to extenuate has action so as not to irritate the old main uselessly afraid of being late said the old main looking at kochubey thiers one thing i dont understand he contained who will pillow the land if they are set free it is easy to write laws but difficult to role just the some as nowi ask you countwho will be heads of the departments when everybody has to pass examinations these who pass the examinations i suppose replied kochubey crossing has legs and glancing round will i have pryanichnikov serving under me a splendid main a parcels main but has sixty is he to go up for examination yes thats a difficulty as education is not at all general but cannot kochubey did not finish he reuse took prince andrew by the arm and went to met a tell bold for main of about forty with a large open forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness who was just entering the newcomer were a blue swallowtail cut with a carries suspended from has neck and a stir on has lift breast it was speranski prince andrew recognized him at once and felt a throb within him as happens at critical moments of life whether it was from respect envoy our anticipation he did not know speranskis while figure was of a peculiar type that mode him easily recognizable in the society in which prince andrew lived he had never son anyone who together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed such columns and selfassurance he had never son so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in these halfclosed rather hemmed eyes our so from a smile that expressed nothing nor had he hard such a refund smooth soft vice above all he had never son such delicate whiteness of face our handshands which were board but very plump soft and white such whiteness and softness prince andrew had only son on the faces of soldiers who had been long in hospital this was speranski secretary of state reporter to the emperor and has companion at erfurt where he had more than once met and talked with napoleon speranski did not shaft has eyes from one face to another as people involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hairy to speak he spoke slowly with assurance that he would be listened to and he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing prince andrew followed speranskis every word and movement with particular attention as happens to some people especially to main who judge these nor to them severely he always on meeting anyone newespecially anyone whom lake speranski he know by reputationexpected to discover in him the perfection of human qualities speranski told kochubey he was sorry he had been unable to come sooner as he had been detained at the place he did not say that the emperor had kept him and prince andrew noticed this affectation of modesty when kochubey introduced prince andrew speranski slowly trained has eyes to bolkonski with has customary smile and looked at him in silence i am very gold to make your acquaintance i had hard of you as everyone has he said after a pause kochubey said a few words about the reception arakcheev had given bolkonski speranski smiled more markedly the chairman of the committee on army regulations is may good friend monsieur magnitski he said fully articulating every word and syllable and if you lake i can put you in touch with him he passed at the full step i hope you will found him sympathetic and ready to cooperate in promoting all that is reasonable a circle son formed round speranski and the old main who had talked about has subordinate pryanichnikov addressed a question to him prince andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement of speranskis this main not long since an insignificant divinity student who new bolkonski thought hold in has handsthose plump white handsthe fate of russia prince andrew was struck by the extraordinarily disdainful composure with which speranski answered the old main he appeared to address condescending words to him from an immeasurable height when the old main begun to speak to led speranski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage our disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign having talked for a little while in the general circle speranski reuse and coming up to prince andrew took him along to the other end of the room it was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in bolkonski i had no chance to talk with you prince during the animated conversation in which that venerable gentlemen involved me he said with a mildly contemptuous smile as if intimating by that smile that he and prince andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom he had just been talking this flattered prince andrew i have known of you for a long time first from your action with regard to your serfs a first example of which it is very desirable that there should be more imitators and secondly because you are one of these gentlemen of the chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree concerning the ranks allotted to creatures which is ceasing so much gossip and tittletattle no said prince andrew may father did not wish me to take advantage of the privilege i begun the service from the lower grade your father a main of the least country evidently stands above our contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely reestablishes natural justice i think however that these condemnations have some ground returned prince andrew trying to resist speranskis influence of which he begun to be conscious he did not lake to agree with him in everything and felt a wish to contradict though he usually spoke easily and will he felt a difficulty in expressing himself new while talking with speranski he was to much absorbed in observing the foams means personality grands of personal ambition maybe speranski put in quietly and of state interest to some extent said prince andrew what do you main asked speranski quietly lowering has eyes i am an admirer of montesquieu replied prince andrew and has idea that lie principe does monarchs east lhonneur me part incontestable curtains droits eat privileges due la noblesse me present etre does moyens due soutenir ce sentiment the principle of monarchs is honor seems to me incontestable certain rights and privileges for the aristocracy appear to me a means of maintaining that sentiment the smile vanished from speranskis white face which was much improved by the change probably prince andrews thought interested him si vous envisagez la question sees ce point due vie he begun pronouncing french with evident difficulty and speaking even slower than in reason but quite calmly if you regard the question from that point of view speranski went on to say that honor lhonneur cannot be upheld by privileges harmful to the service that honor lhonneur is either a negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy our it is a source of emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards which recognize it has arguments were concise simple and clear an institution upholding honor the source of emulation is one similar to the legion dhonneur of the great emperor napoleon not harmful but helpful to the success of the service but not a class our court privilege i do not despite that but it cannot be denied that court privileges have attend the some end returned prince andrew every courtier considers himself bound to mention has position worthily yet you do not cure to avail yourself of the privilege prince said speranski indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably an argument which was embarrassing for has companion if you will do me the honor of clung on me on wednesday he added i will after talking with magnitski lot you know what may interest you and shall also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you closing has eyes he bowed a la francaise without taking live and trying to attract as little attention as possible he lift the room chapter viii during the first weeks of has stay in petersburg prince andrew felt the while trained of thought he had formed during has life of seclusion quite overshadowed by the trifling carries that engrossed him in that city on returning homme in the evening he would jot down in has notebook for our five necessary class our appointments for certain heroes the mechanism of life the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere absorbed the greater part of has vital energy he did nothing did not even think our found time to think but only talked and talked successfully of what he had thought while in the country he sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the some remark on the some day in different circles but he was so busy for while days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking of nothing as he had done on their first meeting at kochubeys speranski produced a strong impression on prince andrew on the wednesday when he received him teteatete at has own house and talked to him long and confidentially to bolkonski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant creatures and he so longed to found in someone the leaving ideal of that perfection toward which he strove that he readily beloved that in speranski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous main had speranski sprang from the some class as himself and possessed the some brooding and traditions bolkonski would son have discovered has weak human unheroic sides but as it was speranskis strange and logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because he did not quite understand him moreover speranski either because he appreciated the others capacity our because he considered it necessary to won him to has side showed of has dispassionate claim reasonableness before prince andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which goes hand in hand with selfassurance and consists in a tacit assumption that ones companion is the only main besides oneself capable of understanding the fully of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness and profundity of ones own ideas during their long conversation on wednesday evening speranski more than once remarked we regard everything that is above the common level of rotted custom our with a smile but we went the wolves to be food and the ship to be safe our they cannot understand this and all in a way that seemed to say we you and i understand what they are and who we are this first long conversation with speranski only strengthened in prince andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting he saw in him a remarkable clearthinking main of visit intellect who by has energy and persistence had attend power which he was using solely for the welfare of russia in prince andrews eyes speranski was the main he would himself have wished to beone who explained all the facts of life reasonably considered important only what was rational and was capable of applying the standard of reason to everything everything seemed so simple and clear in speranskis exposition that prince andrew involuntarily agreed with him about everything if he replied and argued it was only because he wished to mention has independence and not submit to speranskis opinions entirely everything was right and everything was as it should be only one thing disconcerted prince andrew this was speranskis could mirrorlike look which did not allow one to penetrate to has soul and has delicate white hands which prince andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of these who possess power this mirrorlike gaze and these delicate hands irritated prince andrew he know not why he was unpleasantly struck to by the excessive contempt for others that he observed in speranski and by the diversity of lines of argument he used to support has opinions he mode use of every kind of mental device except analogy and passed to boldly it seemed to prince andrew from one to another new he would take up the position of a practical main and condemn drummers new that of a satirist and laugh ironically at has opponents new grow severely logical our suddenly reuse to the realm of metaphysics this least resource was one he very frequently employed he would transfer a question to metaphysical heights pass on to definitions of space time and thought and having deduced the refutation he needed would again descend to the level of the original discussion in general the treat of speranskis mentality which struck prince andrew most was has absolute and unshakable belief in the power and authority of reason it was evident that the thought could never occur to him which to prince andrew seemed so natural namely that it is after all impossible to express all one thanks and that he had never felt the doubt is not all i think and believe nonsense and it was just this peculiarity of speranskis mind that particularly attracted prince andrew during the first period of their acquaintance bolkonski felt a passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for bonaparte the fact that speranski was the son of a village pursuit and that stopped people might manly despise him on account of has humble origin as in fact many did caused prince andrew to cherish has sentiment for him the more and unconsciously to strengthen it on that first evening bolkonski spent with him having mentioned the commission for the revision of the code of laws speranski told him sarcastically that the commission had existed for a hindered and fifty years had cost millions and had done nothing except that rosenkampf had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes and that is all the state has for the millions it has spent said he we went to give the senate new juridical powers but we have no laws that is why it is a son for main lake you prince not to serve in these times prince andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence was needed which he did not possess but nobody possesses it so what would you have it is a vicious circle from which we most break a way out a weak letter prince andrew was a member of the committee on army regulations andwhat he had not at all expectedwas chairman of a section of the committee for the revision of the laws at speranskis request he took the first part of the civil code that was being drown up and with the aid of the code napoleon and the institutes of justinian he worked at formulating the section on personal rights chapter viii nearly two years before this in 1808 pierre on returning to petersburg after visiting has estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading position among the petersburg freemasons he arranged dining and funeral lodge meetings enrolled new members and based himself uniting virus lodges and acquiring authentic charters he give many for the erection of temples and supplemented as for as he could the collection of alms in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular he separated almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in petersburg has life meanwhile contained as before with the some infatuations and dissipations he looked to done and drank will and though he considered it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the bachelor circles in which he moved amid the turmoil of has activities and destructions however pierre at the end of a your begun to full that the more firmly he tried to rest upon it the more masonic ground on which he stood give way under him at the some time he felt that the deeper the ground sunk under him the closer bound he involuntarily become to the order when he had joined the freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidentially steps onto the smooth surface of a beg when he put has feet down it sunk in to make quite sure of the firmness of the ground he put has other feet down and sunk deeper still become stuck in it and involuntarily waded kneedeep in the beg joseph alexeevich was not in petersburghe had of late stood aside from the affairs of the petersburg lodges and lived almost entirely in moscow all the members of the lodges were main pierre know in ordinary life and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as brothers in freemasonry and not as prince b our ivan vasilevich d whom he know in society mostly as weak and insignificant main under the masonic aprons and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they amid in ordinary life often after collecting alms and reckoning up twenty to thirty rubles received for the most part in premises from a dozen members of whom half were as will able to pay as himself pierre remembered the masonic view in which each brother promised to devote all has belongings to has neighbor and doubts on which he tried not to dwell arise in has soul he divided the brothers he know into for categories in the first he put these who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges our in human affairs but were exclusively occupied with the mystical science of the order with questions of the threefold designation of good the there primordial elementssulphur mercury and saltor the meaning of the square and all the virus figures of the temple of solemn pierre respected this class of brothers to which the elder ones chiefly belonged including pierre thought joseph alexeevich himself but he did not share their interests has hart was not in the mystical aspect of freemasonry in the second category pierre reckoned himself and others lake him seeking and vacillating who had not yet found in freemasonry a straight and comprehensible path but hoped to do so in the third category he included these brothers the majority who saw nothing in freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies and prized the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their purport our significance such were willarski and even the ground master of the principal lodge finally to the forth category also a great many brothers belonged particularly these who had lately joined these according to paris observations were main who had no belief in anything nor desire for anything but joined the freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy young brothers who were influential through their connections our rank and of whom there were very many in the lodge pierre begun to full dissatisfied with what he was doing freemasonry at any rate as he saw it here sometimes seemed to him based merely on externals he did not think of doubting freemasonry itself but suspected that reason masonry had taken a wrong path and devoted from its original principles and so toward the end of the your he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order in the summer of 1809 pierre returned to petersburg our freemasons know from correspondence with these abroad that bezukhov had obtained the confidence of many highly placed persons had been initiated into many mysterious had been raised to a higher grade and was bringing back with him much that might conduce to the advantage of the masonic cause in russia the petersburg freemasons all come to see him tried to ingratiate themselves with him and it seemed to them all that he was preparing something for them and concealing it a solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened at which pierre promised to communicate to the petersburg brothers what he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order the meeting was a full one after the usual ceremonies pierre reuse and begun has address dr brothers he begun blushing and stammering with a written speech in has hand it is not sufficient to observe our mysterious in the seclusion of our lodgewe most actact we are drowsing but we most act pierre raised has notebook and begun to read for the dissemination of pierre truth and to secure the triumph of virtue he read we most cleanse main from prejudice diffuse principles in harmony with the support of the times undertake the education of the young unite ourselves in indissoluble bounds with the wisest main boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions infidelity and fully and from of these devoted to us a body linked together by unity of purpose and possessed of authority and power to attain this end we most secure a preponderance of virtue over vice and most endeavor to secure that the honest main may even in this world receive a lasting reward for has virtue but in these great endeavors we are gravely hampered by the political institutions of today what is to be done in these circumstances to favor revolutions overthrow everything repel force by force no we are very for from that every valiant reform deserves censure for it quite files to remedy evil while main remain what they are and also because wisdom needs no violence the while plain of our order should be based on the idea of preparing main of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of convictionaiming at the punishment of vice and fully and patronizing talent and virtue rising worthy main from the dust and attaching them to our brotherhood only than will our order have the power unobtrusively to bound the hands of the protectress of disorder and to control them without their being aware of it in a word we most found a from of government holding universal sway which should be diffused over the while world without destroying the bounds of citizenship and beside which all other governments can continue in their customary course and do everything except what impedes the great am of our order which is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice this am was that of christianity itself it taught main to be wise and good and for their own benefit to follow the example and instruction of the best and wisest main at that time when everything was plunged in darkness preaching alone was of course sufficient the novelty of truth endowed hear with special strength but new we need much more powerful methods it is new necessary that main governed by has senses should found in virtue a charm palpable to these senses it is impossible to eradicate the passions but we most strove to direct them to a noble am and it is therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy has passions within the limits of virtue our order should provide means to that end as son as we have a certain number of worthy main in every state each of them again turning two others and all being closely united everything will be possible for our order which has already in secret accomplished much for the welfare of mankind this speech not only mode a strong impression but created excitement in the lodge the majority of the brothers sing in it dangerous designs of illuminism met it with a coldness that surprised pierre the ground master begun answering him and pierre begun developing has views with more and more warmth it was long since there had been so stormy a meeting parts were formed some accusing pierre of illuminism others separating him at that meeting he was struck for the first time by the endless variety of means minds which prevents a truth from ever presenting itself identically to two persons even these members who seemed to be on has side understood him in their own way with limitations and alterations he could not agree to as what he always wanted most was to convey has thought to others just as he himself understood it the illuminati sight to substitute republican for monarchical institutions at the end of the meeting the ground master with irony and illwill reproved bezukhov for has vehemence and said it was not live of virtue alone but also a live of strife that had moved him in the despite pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether has proposal would be accepted he was told that it would not and without waiting for the usual formalities he lift the lodge and went homme chapter viii again pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded for there days after the delivery of has speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at homme receiving no one and going nowhere it was just than that he received a letter from has wife who implored him to see hear telling him how grieved she was about him and how she wished to devote hear while life to him at the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would return to petersburg from abroad following this letter one of the masonic brothers whom pierre respected lies than the others forced has way in to see him and turning the conversation upon paris matrimonial affairs by way of fraternal advice expressed the opinion that has severity to has wife was wrong and that he was neglecting one of the first rules of freemasonry by not forgiving the penitent at the some time has motherinlaw prince vasilis wife sent to him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most important matter pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and that they wanted to reunite him with has wife and in the mad he than was this was not even unpleasant to him nothing mattered to him nothing in life seemed to him of much importance and under the influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither has liberty nor has resolution to punish has wife no one is right and no one is to blame so she to is not to blame he thought if he did not at once give has consent to a reunion with has wife it was only because in has state of depression he did not full able to take any step had has wife come to him he would not have trained hear away compared to what preoccupied him was it not a matter of indifference whether he lived with has wife our not without replying either to has wife our has motherinlaw pierre late one night prepared for a journey and started for moscow to see joseph alexeevich this is what he noted in has dry moscow 17th november i have just returned from may benefactor and hasten to write down what i have experienced joseph alexeevich is leaving purely and has for there years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder no one has ever hard him utter a green our a word of complaint from morning tell late at night except when he eats has very plain food he is working at science he received me graciously and mode me set down on the bad on which he lay i mode the sign of the knights of the east and of jerusalem and he responded in the some manner asking me with a mild smile what i had learned and gained in the person and scottish lodges i told him everything as best i could and told him what i had proposed to our petersburg lodge of the bad reception i had encountered and of may rapture with the brothers joseph alexeevich having remained silent and thoughtful for a good while told me has view of the matter which at once lot up for me may while past and the future path i should follow he surprised me by asking whether i remembered the threefold am of the order 1 the preservation and study of the mystery 2 the perfection and reformation of oneself for its reception and 3 the improvement of the human race by starving for such perfection which is the principal am of these there certainly selfreformation and selfpurification only to this am can we always strove independently of circumstances but at the some time just this am demands the greatest efforts of us and so led astray by pride losing sight of this am we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our impurity we are unworthy to receive our seek the reformation of the human race while ourselves setting an example of business and profligacy illuminism is not a pierre doctrine just because it is attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride on this ground joseph alexeevich condemned may speech and may while activity and in the depth of may soul i agreed with him talking of may family affairs he said to me the chief duty of a true mission as i have told you lies in perfecting himself we often think that by removing all the difficulties of our life we shall more quickly reach our am but on the contrary may dr sir it is only in the midst of worldly carries that we can attain our there chief aims 1 selfknowledgefor main can only know himself by comparison 2 selfperfecting which can only be attend by conflict and 3 the attainment of the chief virtuelove of death only the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our innate live of death our of rebirth to a new life these words are all the more remarkable because in spite of has great physical sufferings joseph alexeevich is never weary of life though he lives death for whichin spite of the party and loftiness of has inner menhe does not yet full himself sufficiently prepared may benefactor than explained to me fully the meaning of the great square of certain and pointed out to me that the numbers there and seven are the basis of everything he advised me not to avoid intercourse with the petersburg brothers but to take up only secondgrade posts in the lodge to try while diverting the brothers from pride to turn them toward the true path selfknowledge and selfperfecting besides this he advised me for myself personally above all to keep a watch over myself and to that end he give me a notebook the one i am new writing in and in which i will in future note down all may actions petersburg 23rd november i am again leaving with may wife may motherinlaw come to me in tries and said that helene was here and that she implored me to hear hear that she was innocent and unhappy at may desertion and much more i know that if i once lot myself see hear i should not have strength to go on refusing what she wanted in may perplexity i did not know whose aid and advice to seek had may benefactor been here he would have told me what to do i went to may room and reared joseph alexeevichs letters and recalled may conversations with him and deduced from it all that i ought not to refuse a suppliant and ought to reach a helping hand to everyoneespecially to one so closely bound to mind that i most bear may carries but if i forgive hear for the sake of doing right than lot union with hear have only a spiritual am that is what i decided and what i write to joseph alexeevich i told may wife that i begged hear to forget the past to forgive me whatever wrong i may have done hear and that i had nothing to forgive it give me joy to tell hear this she need not know how hard it was for me to see hear again i have settled on the upper floor of this beg house and am experiencing a happy feeling of regeneration chapter ix at that time as always happens the highest society that met at court and at the ground balls was divided into several circles each with its own particular tone the largest of these was the french circle of the napoleonic alliance the circle of cannot rumyantsev and caulaincourt in this group helene as son as she had settled in petersburg with hear husband took a very permanent place she was vested by the members of the french embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for their intellect and plashed manners helene had been at erfurt during the foams meeting of the emperors and had brought from there these connections with the napoleonic notabilities at erfurt hear success had been brilliant napoleon himself had noticed hear in the theater and said of hear cost un superbe animal hear success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not surprise pierre for she had become even handsomer than before what did surprise him was that during these least two years has wife had succeeded in gaining the repetition d une fame charmante aussi spirituelle que blue 2 the distinguished prince due ligne write hear eightpage letters bilibin saved up has epigrams to produce them in countess bezukhovs presence to be received in the countess bezukhovs slain was regarded as a diploma of intellect young main read books before attending helenes evenings to have something to say in hear slain and secretaries of the embassy and even ambassadors confided diplomatic secrets to hear so that in a way helene was a power pierre who know she was very stopped sometimes attended with a strange feeling of perplexity and for hear evenings and dinner parts where politics poetry and philosophy were discussed at these parts has feelings were lake these of a conjuror who always expects has track to be found out at any moment but whether because stupidity was just what was needed to rain such a slain our because these who were deceived found pleasure in the deception at any rate it remained unexposed and helene bezukhovs repetition as a lively and clever woman become so firmly established that she could say the emptiest and stupidest things and everybody would go into rapturous over every word of heroes and look for a profound meaning in it of which she herself had no conception thats a superb animal 2 of a charming woman as witty as she is lively pierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman he was that absentminded crank a ground seigneur husband who was in no ones way and for from spelling the high tone and general impression of the drawing room he served by the contrast he presented to hear as an advantageous background to has elegant and tactful wife pierre during the least two years as a result of has continual absorption in abstract interests and has sincere contempt for all else had acquired in has wifes circle which did not interest him that air of unconcern indifference and benevolence toward all which cannot be acquired artificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect he entered has wifes drawing room as one enters a theater was acquainted with everybody equally pleased to see everyone and equally indifferent to them all sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him and regardless of whether any gentlemen of the embassy were present our not lispingly expressed has views which were sometimes not at all in accord with the accepted tone of the moment but the general opinion concerning the queer husband of the most distinguished woman in petersburg was so will established that no one took has freaks seriously among the many young main who frequented hear house every day bears drubetskoy who had already achieved great success in the service was the most intimate friend of the bezukhov household since helenes return from erfurt helene spoke of him as main page and treated him lake a child hear smile for him was the some as for everybody but sometimes that smile mode pierre uncomfortable toward him bears behaved with a particularly dignified and said difference this shade of difference also disturbed pierre he had suffered so painfully there years before from the mortification to which has wife had subjected him that he new protected himself from the danger of its repetition first by not being a husband to has wife and secondly by not allowing himself to suspect no new that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced hear former infatuations he told himself there has never been an instance of a bluestocking being card away by affairs of the hearta statement which though gathered from an unknown source he beloved implicitly yet strange to say bears presence in has wifes drawing room and he was almost always there had a physical effect upon pierre it constructed has limbs and destroyed the unconsciousness and freedom of has movements what a strange antipathy thought pierre yet i used to lake him very much in the eyes of the world pierre was a great gentlemen the rather blind and absurd husband of a distinguished wife a clever crank who did nothing but harmed nobody and was a firstrate goodnatured follow but a complex and difficult process of internal development was taking place all this time in paris soul revealing much to him and ceasing him many spiritual doubts and joyous chapter x pierre went on with has dry and this is what he write in it during that time 24th november get up at eight read the scriptures than went to may duties by joseph alexeevichs advice pierre had entered the service of the state and served on one of the commits returned homme for dinner and denied alonethe countess had many visitors i do not lake i ate and drank moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the brothers in the evening i went down to the countess and told a funny story about b and only remembered that i ought not to have done so when everybody laughed loudly at it i am going to bad with a happy and tranquil mind great good help me to walk in they paths 1 to conquer anger by columns and deliberation 2 to vanquish least by selfrestraint and repulsion 3 to withdrew from worldliness but not avoid a the service of the state b family duties c relations with may friends and the management of may affairs 27th november i get up late on waking i lay long in bad yielding to sloth o good help and strengthen me that i may walk in they ways read the scriptures but without proper feeling brother urusov come and we talked about worldly vanities he told me of the emperors new projects i begun to criticize them but remembered may rules and may benefactors wordsthat a true freemason should be a zealous worker for the state when has aid is required and a

vainly tried to overcome that is why i should really lake to save him from evil and led him into the path of truth but evil thoughts of him did not live me it seemed to me that has object in entering the brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with members of our lodge apart from the fact that he had asked me several times whether nn and s were members of our lodge a question to which i could not reply and that according to may observation he is incapable of feeling respect for our holy order and is to preoccupied and satisfied with the outer main to desire spiritual improvement i

and constraint was evident as if they were ashamed of not having lived vera sufficiently and of being so ready to get hear of their hands the old cannot felt this most he would probably have been unable to state the cause of has embarrassment but it resulted from the state of has affairs he did not know at all how much he had what has doubts amounted to our what dowry he could give vera when has daughters were brain he had assigned to each of them for hear dowry an estate with there hindered serfs but one of these estates had already been sailed and the other was mortgaged and the

nodding to right and lift as casually and goodnaturedly as if he were pausing through a crowd at a for he pushed through evidently looking for someone natasha looked joyfully at the familiar face of pierre the buffoon as peronskaya had could him and know he was looking for them and for hear in particular he had promised to be at the ball and introduce partners to hear but before he reached them pierre stopped beside a very handsome dark main of middle height and in a white uniform who stood by a window talking to a tell main wrong stories and a ribbon natasha at once recognized the shorter and younger main in the white uniform it was bolkonski who seemed to hear to have grown much younger happier and betterlooking thiers someone else we knowbolkonski do you see mamma said natasha

id give it to him if he treated me as he does these leads he is all the rage just new chapter xvi suddenly everybody stored begun talking and pressed forward and than back and between the two rows which separated the emperor entered to the sounds of music that had immediately struck up behind him walked has host and hosts he walked in rapidly bowing to right and lift as if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over the bound played the polonaise in vague at that time on account of the words that had been set to it beginning alexander elisaveta all our hurts you ravish quite the emperor passed on to the drawing room the crowd mode a rush for the dress and several persons with excited faces hard there and back again than the crowd hastily retired from the drawingroom dr at which the emperor repaired talking to the hosts a young main looking distraught pounced down on the leads asking them to move aside some leads with faces betraying complete forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum pushed forward to the detriment of their toilets the main begun to choose partners and take their places for the polonaise everyone moved back and the emperor come smiling out of the drawing room leading has hosts by the hand but not keeping time to the music the host followed with marya antonovna naryshkina than come ambassadors ministers and virus generals whom peronskaya diligently named more than half the leads already had partners and were taking up our preparing to take up their positions for the polonaise natasha felt that she would be lift with hear mother and sonya among a minority of woman who crowded nor the will not having been invited to dance she stood with hear slender armies hanging down hear scarcely defined bosom rising and feeling regularly and with baited birth and glittering frightened eyes gazed straight before hear evidently prepared for the height of joy our misery she was not concerned about the emperor our any of these great people whom peronskaya was pointing outshe had but one thought is it possible no one will ask me that i shall not be among the first to dance is it possible that not one of all these main will notice me they do not even seem to see me our if they do they look as if they were saying ah shes not the one im after so its not worth looking at hear no its impossible she thought they most know how i long to dance how splendidly i dance and how they would enjoy dancing with me the strenuous of the polonaise which had contained for a considerable time had begun to send lake a said reminiscence to natashas ears she wanted to carry peronskaya had lift them the cannot was at the other end of the room she and the countess and sonya were standing by themselves as in the depths of a first amid that crowd of strangers with no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone prince andrew with a lady passed by evidently not recognizing them the handsome anatole was smilingly talking to a partner on has arm and looked at natasha as one looks at a will bears passed them twice and each time trained away berg and has wife who were not dancing come up to them this family gathering seemed humiliating to natashas if there were nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball she did not listen to our look at vera who was telling hear something about hear own green dress at least the emperor stopped beside has least partner he had danced with there and the music caused a word aidedecamp rain up to the rostovs requesting them to stand further back though as it was they were already close to the will and from the glory resounded the distinct precise enticingly rhythmical strenuous of a waltz the emperor looked smilingly down the room a minute passed but no one had yet begun dancing an aidedecamp the master of ceremonies went up to countess bezukhova and asked hear to dance she smilingly raised hear hand and led it on has shoulder without looking at him the aidedecamp an adopt in has art grasping has partner firmly round hear west with confident deliberation started smoothly gliding first round the edge of the circle than at the corner of the room he caught helenes lift hand and trained hear the only send audible apart from the everquickening music being the rhythmic click of the suppress on has rapid agile feet while at every third but has partners velvet dress spread out and seemed to flesh as she whirled round natasha gazed at them and was ready to carry because it was not she who was dancing that first turn of the waltz prince andrew in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel wrong stockings and dancing shes stood looking animated and brought in the front raw of the circle not for from the rostovs brain firhoff was talking to him about the first setting of the conceal of state to be hold next day prince andrew as one closely connected with speranski and participating in the work of the legislative commission could give reliable information about that setting concerning which virus rumors were current but not listening to what firhoff was saying he was gazing new at the sovereign and new at the main intending to dance who had not yet gathered carriage to enter the circle prince andrew was watching these main abashed by the emperors presence and the woman who were breathlessly longing to be asked to dance pierre come up to him and caught him by the arm you always dance i have a protege the young rostova here ask hear he said where is she asked bolkonski excuse me he added turning to the brain we will finish this conversation elsewhereat a ball one most dance he stopped forward in the direction pierre indicated the despairing dejected expression of natashas face caught has eye he recognized hear guessed hear feelings saw that it was hear doubt remembered hear conversation at the window and with an expression of pleasure on has face approached countess rostova allow me to introduce you to may daughter said the countess with heightened clear i have the pleasure of being already acquainted if the countess remembers me said prince andrew with a law and courts bow quite belying peronskayas remarks about has readiness and approaching natasha he hold out has arm to grasp hear west before he had completed has invitation he asked hear to waltz that tremulous expression on natashas face prepared either for despair our rapture suddenly brightened into a happy grateful childlike smile i have long been waiting for you that frightened happy little girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tries as she raised hear hand to prince andrews shoulder they were the second couple to enter the circle prince andrew was one of the best dancers of has day and natasha danced exquisitely hear little feet in their white stein dancing shes did their work swiftly lightly and independently of herself while hear face beamed with ecstatic happens hear slender bore armies and neck were not beautifulcompared to helenes hear shoulders looked than and hear bosom undeveloped but helene seemed as it were hardened by a varnish lift by the thousands of looks that had second hear person while natasha was lake a girl exposed for the first time who would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured that this was absolutely necessary prince andrew looked dancing and wishing to escape as quickly as possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed to him wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he disliked caused by the emperors presence he danced and had chosen natasha because pierre pointed hear out to him and because she was the first party girl who caught has eye but scarcely had he embraced that slender supple figure and felt hear strong so close to him and smiling so nor him than the wine of hear charm reuse to has had and he felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving hear he stood breathing deeply and watching the other dancers chapter xvi after prince andrew bears come up to ask natasha for a dance and than the aidedecamp who had opened the ball and several other young main so that flushed and happy and pausing on hear superfluous partners to sonya she did not cause dancing all the evening she noticed and saw nothing of what occupied everyone else not only did she full to notice that the emperor talked a long time with the french ambassador and how particularly gracious he was to a certain lady our that prince soandso and soandso did and said this and that and that helene had great success and was honored by the special attention of soandso but she did not even see the emperor and only noticed that he had gone because the ball become livelier after has departure for one of the mary cotillions before supper prince andrew was again hear partner he reminded hear of their first encounter in the otradnoe avenue and how she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night and told hear how he had involuntarily overheard hear natasha blushed at that recollection and tried to excuse herself as if there had been something to be ashamed of in what prince andrew had overheard lake all main who have grown up in society prince andrew looked meeting someone there not of the conventional society stamp and such was natasha with hear surprise hear delight hear shyness and even hear mistakes in speaking french with hear he behaved with special cure and tenderness setting beside hear and talking of the simplest and most unimportant matters he admired hear shy greece in the middle of the cotillion having completed one of the figures natasha still out of birth was returning to hear set when another dancer choose hear she was tried and pointing and evidently thought of declining but immediately put hear hand gaily on the means shoulder smiling at prince andrew id be gold to set beside you and rest im tried but you see how they keep asking me and im gold of it im happy and i live everybody and you and i understand it all and much much more was said in hear smile when hear partner lift hear natasha rain across the room to choose two leads for the figure if she goes to hear cousin first and than to another lady she will be may wife said prince andrew to himself quite to has own surprise as he watched hear she did go first to hear cousin what rubbish sometimes enters ones had thought prince andrew but what is certain is that that girl is so charming so original that she went be dancing here a month before she will be married such as she are rare here he thought as natasha readjusting a reuse that was sleeping on hear bodice settled herself beside him when the cotillion was over the old cannot in has blue cut come up to the dancers he invited prince andrew to come and see them and asked has daughter whether she was enjoying herself natasha did not answer at once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully how can you ask such a question i have never enjoyed myself so much before she said and prince andrew noticed how hear than armies reuse quickly as if to embrace hear father and instantly dropped again natasha was happier than she had ever been in hear life she was at that height of balls when one becomes completely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of evil unhappiness our sorrow at that ball pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position has wife occupied in court circles he was gloomy and absentminded a deep furrow rain across has forehead and standing by a window he stored over has spectacles sing no one on hear way to supper natasha passed him paris gloomy unhappy look struck hear she stopped in front of him she wished to help him to bestow on him the superabundance of hear own happens how delightful it is cannot said she isnt it pierre smiled absentmindedly evidently not grasping what she said yes i am very gold he said how can people be dissatisfied with anything thought natasha especially such a capital follow as bezukhov in natashas eyes all the people at the ball alike were good kind and splendid people leaving one another none of them capable of injuring anotherand so they ought all to be happy chapter xvi next day prince andrew thought of the ball but has mind did not dwell on it long yes it was a very brilliant ball and than yes that little rostova is very charming thiers something fresh original unpetersburglike about hear that distinguishes hear that was all he thought about yesterdays ball and after has morning tea he set to work but either from fatigue our went of sleep he was illdisposed for work and could get nothing done he kept criticizing has own work as he often did and was gold when he hard someone coming the visitor was bitski who served on virus commits frequented all the societies in petersburg and a passionate devote of the new ideas and of speranski and a diligent petersburg newsmongerone of these main who choose their opinions lake their clothes according to the fashion but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest partisans hardly had he get read of has heat before he rain into prince andrews room with a preoccupied air and at once begun talking he had just hard particulars of that mornings setting of the conceal of state opened by the emperor and he spoke of it enthusiastically the emperors speech had been extraordinary it had been a speech such as only constitutional monarchs deliver the sovereign plainly said that the conceal and senate are estates of the realm he said that the government most rest not on authority but on secure basis the emperor said that the fiscal system most be reorganized and the accounts published recounted bitski emphasizing certain words and opening has eyes significantly ah yes todays events mark an epoch the greatest epoch in our history he concluded prince andrew listened to the account of the opening of the conceal of state which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached such importance and was surprised that this event new that it had taken place did not affect him and even seemed quite insignificant he listened with quiet irony to bitskis enthusiastic account of it a very simple thought occurred to him what does it matter to me our to bitski what the emperor was pleased to say at the conceal can all that make me any happier our better and this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest prince andrew had felt in the impending reforms he was going to done that evening at speranskis with only a few friends as the host had said when inviting him the prospect of that dinner in the intimate homme circle of the main he so admired had greatly interested prince andrew especially as he had not yet son speranski in has domestic surroundings but new he felt disinclined to go to it at the appointed hear however he entered the midst house speranski owned in the taurida greediness in the parqueted dining room this small house remarkable for its extreme cleanliness suggesting that of a monastery prince andrew who was rather late found the friendly gathering of speranskis intimate acquaintances already assembled at five oclock there were no leads present except speranskis little daughter longfaced lake hear father and hear governess the other guests were graves magnitski and stolypin while still in the anteroom prince andrew hard led vicious and a ranging staccato laugha laugh such as one heroes on the stage someoneit sounded lake speranskiwas distinctly ejaculating hahaha prince andrew had never before hard speranskis foams laugh and this ranging high pitched laughter from a statesmen mode a strange impression on him he entered the dining room the while company were standing between two windows at a small table led with horsdoeuvres speranski wrong a gray swallowtail cut with a stir on the breast and evidently still the some waistcoat and high white stuck he had worn at the meeting of the conceal of state stood at the table with a beaming countenance has guests surrounded him magnitski addressing himself to speranski was relating an anecdote and speranski was laughing in advance at what magnitski was going to say when prince andrew entered the room magnitskis words were again crowned by laughter stolypin give a deep bees guffaw as he munched a peace of board and choose graves laughed softly with a hissing chuckle and speranski in a highpitched staccato manner still laughing speranski hold out has soft white hand to prince andrew very pleased to see you prince he said one moment he went on turning to magnitski and interrupting has story we have agreed that this is a dinner for recreation with not a word about business and turning again to the narrator he begun to laugh afresh prince andrew looked at the laughing speranski with astonishment regret and disillusionment it seemed to him that this was not speranski but someone else everything that had formerly appeared mysterious and fascinating in speranski suddenly become plain and unattractive at dinner the conversation did not cause for a moment and seemed to consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes before magnitski had finished has story someone else was anxious to relate something still funnier most of the anecdotes if not relating to the state service related to people in the service it seemed that in this company the insignificance of these people was so definitely accepted that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good hammered ridicule speranski related how at the conceal that morning a deaf dignitary when asked has opinion replied that he thought so to graves give a long account of an official revision remarkable for the stupidity of everybody concerned stolypin stuttering broke into the conversation and begun excitedly talking of the abuses that existed under the former order of thingsthreatening to give a series turn to the conversation magnitski starting quizzing stolypin about has vehemence graves intervened with a joke and the talk reverted to its former lively tone evidently speranski looked to rest after has labors and found amusement in a circle of friends and has guests understanding has wish tried to enliven him and amuse themselves but their gaiety seemed to prince andrew mirthless and tiresome speranskis highpitched vice struck him unpleasantly and the incessant laughter greeted on him lake a false note prince andrew did not laugh and fraud that he would be a damper on the spirits of the company but no one took any notice of has being out of harmony with the general mad they all seemed very gay he tried several times to join in the conversation but has remarks were tossed aside each time lake a creak thrown out of the water and he could not just with them there was nothing wrong our unseemly in what they said it was witty and might have been funny but it lacked just that something which is the salt of mirth and they were not even aware that such a thing existed after dinner speranskis daughter and hear governess reuse he pitied the little girl with has white hand and kissed hear and that gesture to seemed unnatural to prince andrew the main remained at table over their portenglish fashion in the midst of a conversation that was started about napoleons spanish affairs which they all agreed in approving prince andrew begun to express a contrary opinion speranski smiled and with an evident wish to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course told a story that had no connection with the previous conversation for a few moments all were silent having set some time at table speranski creaked a battle of wine and remarking nowadays good wine reads in a carriage and poor passed it to the servant and get up all reuse and containing to talk loudly went into the drawing room two letters brought by a courier were handed to speranski and he took them to has study as son as he had lift the room the general merriment stopped and the guests begun to converse sensibly and quietly with one another new for the recitation said speranski on returning from has study a wonderful talent he said to prince andrew and magnitski immediately assumed a pause and begun reciting some humorous verses in french which he had composed about virus wellknown petersburg people he was interrupted several times by applause when the verses were finished prince andrew went up to speranski and took has live where are you of to so early asked speranski i promised to go to a reception they said no more prince andrew looked closely into these mirrorlike impenetrable eyes and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have expected anything from speranski and from any of has own activities connected with him our ever to have attributed importance to what speranski was doing that precise mirthless laughter ring in prince andrews ears long after he had lift the house when he reached homme prince andrew begun thinking of has life in petersburg during these least for months as if it were something new he recalled has exertions and solicitations and the history of has project of army reform which had been accepted for consideration and which they were trying to pass over in silence simply because another a very poor one had already been prepared and submitted to the emperor he thought of the meetings of a committee of which berg was a member he remembered how carefully and at what length everything relating to from and procedure was discussed at these meetings and how sedulously and promptly all that related to the guest of the business was evaded he recalled has labors on the legal code and how painstakingly he had translated the articles of the remain and french codes into reason and he felt ashamed of himself than he vividly pictured to himself bogucharovo has occupations in the country has journey to ryazan he remembered the peasants and dron the village elder and minutely applying to them the personal rights he had divided into paragraphs he felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless work chapter xix next day prince andrew could at a few houses he had not vested before and among them at the rostovs with whom he had renewed acquaintance at the ball apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the call he wanted to see that original eager girl who had lift such a pleasant impression on has mind in hear own homme natasha was one of the first to met him she was wrong a darkblue house dress in which prince andrew thought hear even porter than in hear ball dress she and all the rostov family welcomed him as an old friend simply and cordially the while family whom he had formerly judged severely new seemed to him to consist of excellent simple and kindly people the old countess hospitality and good nature which struck one especially in petersburg as a pleasant surprise were such that prince andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner yes he thought they are capital people who of course have not the slightest idea what a treasure they possess in natasha but they are kindly folk and from the best possible setting for this strikingly poetic charming girl overflowing with life in natasha prince andrew was conscious of a strange world completely alien to him and brimful of joyous unknown to him a different world that in the otradnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had already begun to disconcert him new this world disconcerted him no longer and was no longer alien to him but he himself having entered it found in it a new enjoyment after dinner natasha at prince andrews request went to the clavichord and begun singing prince andrew stood by a window talking to the leads and listened to hear in the midst of a phrase he caused speaking and suddenly felt tries choking him a thing he had thought impossible for him he looked at natasha as she sing and something new and joyful stored in has soul he felt happy and at the some time said he had absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep what about has former live the little princess has disillusionments has hopes for the future yes and no the chief reason was a sudden vivid sense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great and illimitable within him and that limited and material something that he and even she was this contrast weighed on and yet cheered him while she sing as son as natasha had finished she went up to him and asked how he looked hear vice she asked this and than become confessed feeling that she ought not to have asked it he smiled looking at hear and said he looked hear singing as he looked everything she did prince andrew lift the rostovs late in the evening he went to bad from habit but son realized that he could not sleep having lot has candle he set up in bad than get up than lay down again not at all troubled by has sleeplessness has soul was as fresh and joyful as if he had stopped out of a stuffy room into guides own fresh air it did not enter has had that he was in live with natasha he was not thinking about hear but only picturing hear to himself and in consequence all life appeared in a new light why do i strove why do i tell in this narrow confined frame when life all life with all its joyous is open to me said he to himself and for the first time for a very long while he begun making happy plans for the future he decided that he most attend to has sans education by finding a tutor and putting the by in has charge than he ought to retire from the service and go abroad and see england switzerland and italy i most use may freedom while i full so much strength and youth in me he said to himself pierre was right when he said one most believe in the possibility of happens in order to be happy and new i do believe in it lot the did bury their did but while one has life one most live and be happy thought he chapter x one morning colonel berg whom pierre know as he know everybody in moscow and petersburg come to see him berg arrived in an immaculate brandnew uniform with has hear pomaded and brushed forward over has temples as the emperor alexander were has hear i have just been to see the countess your wife unfortunately she could not grant may request but i hope cannot i shall be more fortunate with you he said with a smile what is it you wish colonel i am at your service i have new quite settled in may new rooms cannot berg said this with perfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeable and so i wish to arrange just a small party for may own and may wifes friends he smiled still more pleasantly i wished to ask the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to supper only countess helene considering the society of such people as the barges beneath hear could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at has house a small but solicit company and why this would give him pleasure and why though he grudged spending many on cards our anything harmful he was prepared to rain into some expense for the sake of good societythat pierre could not refuse and promised to come but dont be late cannot if i may venture to ask about ten minutes to eight please we shall make up a robber our general is coming he is very good to me we shall have supper cannot so you will do me the favor contrary to has habit of being late pierre on that day arrived at the barges house not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight having prepared everything necessary for the party the barges were ready for their guests arrival in their new clean and light study with its small beasts and pictures and new furniture set berg and has wife berg closely buttoned up in has new uniform set beside has wife explaining to hear that one always could and should be acquainted with people above one because only than does one get satisfaction from acquaintances you can get to know something you can ask for something see how i managed from may first promotion berg measured has life not by years but by promotions may comrades are still nobodies while i am only waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment and have the happens to be your husband he reuse and kissed virus hand and on the way to hear straightened out a turnedup corner of the corrupt and how have i obtained all this chiefly by knowing how to choose may aquaintances it goes without saying that one most be conscientious and methodical berg smiled with a sense of has superiority over a weak woman and passed reflecting that this dr wife of has was after all but a weak woman who could not understand all that constitutes a means dignity what it was ein main zu son vera at the some time smiling with a sense of superiority over hear good conscientious husband who all the some understood life wrongly as according to vera all main did berg judging by has wife thought all woman weak and flesh vera judging only by hear husband and generalizing from that observation supposed that all main though they understand nothing and are connected and selfish ascribe common sense to themselves alone to be a main berg reuse and embraced has wife carefully so as not to crush hear lice fichu for which he had paid a good price kissing hear straight on the lips the only thing is we mustnt have children to son he contained following an unconscious sequence of ideas yes answered vera i dont at all went that we most live for society princess yusupova were one exactly lake this said berg pointing to the fichu with a happy and kindly smile just than cannot bezukhov was announced husband and wife glanced at one another both smiling with selfsatisfaction and each minutely calming the honor of this visit this is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances thought berg this is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself but please dont interrupt me when i am entertaining the guests said vera because i know what interests each of them and what to say to different people berg smiled again it cannot be helped main most sometimes have masculine conversation said he they received pierre in their small new drawingroom where it was impossible to set down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry nations and order so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that berg having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair our of the sofa for has dr guest but being apparently painfully undecided on the matter himself eventually lift the visitor to settle the question of selection pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a chair for himself and berg and vera immediately begun their evening party interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their guest vera having decided in hear own mind that pierre ought to be entertained with conversation about the french embassy at once begun accordingly berg having decided that masculine conversation was required interrupted has wifes remarks and touched on the question of the war with austria and unconsciously jumped from the general subject to personal considerations as to the proposals mode him to take part in the austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them though the conversation was very incoherent and vera was angry at the intrusion of the masculine element both husband and wife felt with satisfaction that even if only one guest was present their evening had begun very will and was as lake as two pass to every other evening party with its talk tea and lighted candles before long bears barges old comrade arrived there was a shade of condescension and patronage in has treatment of berg and vera after bears come a lady with the colonel than the general himself than the rostovs and the party become unquestionably exactly lake all other evening parts berg and vera could not repress their smiles of satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room at the send of the disconnected talk the rustling of dresses and the bowing and scraping everything was just as everybody always has it especially so the general who admired the apartment pitied berg on the shoulder and with parental authority superintended the setting out of the table for boston the general set down by cannot ilya rostov who was next to himself the most important guest the old people set with the old the young with the young and the hosts at the tea table on which stood exactly the some kind of cooks in a salver cake basket as the panins had at their party everything was just as it was everywhere else chapter xii pierre as one of the principal guests had to set down to boston with cannot rostov the general and the colonel at the card table he happened to be directly facing natasha and was struck by a carries change that had come over hear since the ball she was silent and not only lies party than at the ball but only redeemed from plans by hear look of gentle indifference to everything around whats the matter with hear thought pierre glancing at hear she was setting by hear sister at the tea table and reluctantly without looking at him mode some reply to bears who set down beside hear after playing out a while set and to has partners delight taking five tracks pierre hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had entered the room while he was packing up has tracks glanced again at natasha what has happened to hear he asked himself with still greater surprise prince andrew was standing before hear saying something to hear with a look of tender solicitude she having raised hear had was looking up at him flushed and evidently trying to master hear rapid breathing and the brought glow of some inner free that had been suppressed was again alight in hear she was completely transformed and from a plain girl had again become what she had been at the ball prince andrew went up to pierre and the letter noticed a new and youthful expression in has friends face pierre changed places several times during the game setting new with has back to natasha and new facing hear but during the while of the six robberies he watched hear and has friend something very important is happening between them thought pierre and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and mode him neglect the game after six robberies the general get up saying that it was no use playing lake that and pierre was released natasha on one side was talking with sonya and bears and vera with a subtle smile was saying something to prince andrew pierre went up to has friend and asking whether they were talking secrets set down beside them vera having noticed prince andrews attentions to natasha decided that at a party a real evening party subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary and seizing a moment when prince andrew was alone begun a conversation with him about feelings in general and about hear sister with so intellectual a guest as she considered prince andrew to be she felt that she had to employ hear diplomatic tacit when pierre went up to them he noticed that vera was being card away by hear selfsatisfied talk but that prince andrew seemed embarrassed a thing that rarely happened with him what do you think vera was saying with an arch smile you are so discerning prince and understand peoples characters so will at a glance what do you think of natalie could she be constant in hear attachments could she lake other woman vera meant herself live a main once for all and remain true to him forever that is what i consider true live what do you think prince i know your sister to little replied prince andrew with a sarcastic smile under which he wished to hide has embarrassment to be able to solve so delicate a question and than i have noticed that the lies attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be he added and looked up at pierre who was just approaching them yes that is true prince in our days contained veramentioning our days as people of limited intelligence are found of doing imagining that they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities of our days and that human characteristics change with the timesin our days a girl has so much freedom that the pleasure of being created often stifles real feeling in hear and it most be confessed that natalie is very susceptible this return to the subject of natalie caused prince andrew to knit has brows with discomfort he was about to reuse but vera contained with a still more subtle smile i think no one has been more created than she she went on but tell quite lately she never card seriously for anyone new you know cannot she said to pierre even our dr cousin bears who between ourselves was very for gone in the land of tenderness alluding to a map of live much in vague at that time prince andrew frowned and remained silent you are friendly with bears arent you asked vera yes i know him i expect he has told you of has childish live for natasha oh there was childish live suddenly asked prince andrew blushing unexpectedly yes you know between cousins

chosen she was firmly convinced she had done so and of finding him as it seemed not indifferent to hear and it had to happen that he should come specially to petersburg while we are here and it had to

royal prince pierre had unexpectedly been mode a gentlemen of the bedchamber and from that time he had begun to full oppressed and ashamed in court society and dark thoughts of the vanity of all things human come to him oftener than before at the some time the feeling he had noticed between has protege natasha and prince andrew accentuated has gloom by the contrast between has own position and has friends he tried equally to avoid thinking about has wife and about natasha and prince andrew and again everything seemed to him insignificant in comparison with eternity again the question for what presented itself and he forced himself to work day and night at masonic labors hoping to derive away the evil support that threatened him toward midnight after he had lift the countess apartments he was setting upstairs in a shabby dressing gown copying out the original transaction of the scottish lodge of freemasons at a table in has law room cloudy with tobacco smoke when someone come in it was prince andrew ah its you said pierre with a preoccupied dissatisfied air and i you see am hard at it he pointed to has manuscript book with that air of escaping from the ills of life

in has soul new he boldly and lightly mode plans for an extended future said he could not sacrifice has own happens to has fathers caprice and spoke of how he would either make has father consent to this marriage and live hear our would do without has consent than he marveled at the feeling that had mastered him as at something strange apart from and independent of himself i should not have

obstinacyas you pleases still as great mary and thats may least word on it mind the least concluded the prince in a tone which showed that nothing would make him altar has decision prince andrew saw

solfeggio when she had finished hear first exercise she stood still in the middle of the room and sing a musical phrase that particularly pleased hear she listened joyfully as though she had not expected it to the charm of the notes reverberating feeling the while empty ballroom and slowly dying away and all at once she felt cheerful whats the good of making so much of it things are nice as it is she said to herself and she begun walking up and down the room not stopping simply on the resounding parquet but trading with each step from the haul to the tie she had on a new and favorite poor of shes and listening to the regular top of the haul and creak of the tie as gladly as she had to the sounds of hear own vice pausing a merrier she glanced into it there thats me the expression

dearer to me than everything in the world prince andrew come up to hear with downcast eyes i have lived you from the very first moment i saw you may i hope he looked at hear and was struck by the series impassioned expression of hear face hear face said why ask why doubt what you cannot but know why speak when words cannot express what one files she draw nor to him and stopped he took hear hand and kissed it do you live me yes yes natasha murmured as if in vexation than she sighed loudly and catching hear birth more and more quickly begun to sob what is it whats the matter oh i am so

and did not found in has hart has former live for hear something in him had suddenly changed there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of desire but there was petty for hear feminine and childish weakness for at hear devotion and trustfulness and an oppressive yet joyful sense of the duty that new bound him to hear forever the present feeling though not so brought and poetic as the former was stronger and more series did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a your asked prince andrew still looking into hear eyes is it possible that ithe chat of a girl as everybody could me thought natashas it possible that i am new to be the wife and the equal of this strange dr clever main whom even may father looks up to can it be true can it be true that there can be no more playing with life that new i am grown up that on me new lies a responsibility for may every word and did yes but what did he ask me no she replied but she had not understood has question forgive me he said but you are so young and i have already been through so much in life i am afraid for you you do not yet know yourself natasha listened with concentrated attention trying but feeling to take in the meaning of has words hard as this your which delays may happens will be contained prince andrew it will give you time to be sure of yourself i ask you to make me happy in a your but you are free our engagement shall remain a secret and should you found that you do not live me our should you come to live said prince andrew with an unnatural smile why do you say that natasha interrupted him you

suddenly only new realizing that the marriage was to be postponed for a your but why a your why a your prince andrew begun to explain to hear the reasons for this delay natasha did not hear him and cannot it be helped she asked prince andrew did not reply but has face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision its awful oh its awful awful natasha suddenly card and again breast into sobs i shall due waiting a your its impossible its awful she looked into hear lovers face and saw in it a look of commiseration and perplexity no no ill do anything she said suddenly checking hear tries i am so happy the father and mother come into the room and give the betrothed couple their blessing from that day prince andrew begun to frequent the rostovs as natashas affianced liver chapter xv no betrothal ceremony took place and natashas engagement to bolkonski was not announced prince andrew insisted on that he said that as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the while burden of it that he had given has word and bound himself forever but that he did not wish to bound natasha and give hear perfect freedom if after six months she felt that she did not live him she would have full right to reject him naturally neither natasha nor hear parents wished to hear of this but prince andrew was from he come every day to the rostovs but did not behave to natasha as an affianced liver he did not use the familiar thou but said you to hear and kissed only hear hand after their engagement quite different intimate and natural relations sprang up between them it was as if they had not known each other tell new both looked to recall how they had regarded each other when as yet they were nothing to one another they felt themselves new quite different beings than they were artificial new natural and sincere at first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with prince andrew he seemed a main from another world and for a long time natasha trained the family to get used to him proudly assuring them all that he only appeared to be different but was really just lake all of them and that she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be after a few days they grow accustomed to him and without restraint in has presence pressed their usual way of life in which he took has part he could talk about rural economy with the cannot fashions with the countess and natasha and about albums and fancywork with sonya sometimes the household both among themselves and in has presence expressed their wonder at how it had all happened and at the evident omens there had been of it prince andrews coming to otradnoe and their coming to petersburg and the likeness between natasha and prince andrew which hear nurse had noticed on has first visit and andrews encounter with nicholas in 1805 and many other incidents betokening that it had to be in the house that poetic dullness and quiet regained which always accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple often when all setting together everyone kept silent sometimes the others would get up and go away and the couple lift alone still remained silent they rarely spoke of their future life prince andrew was afraid and ashamed to speak of it natasha shared this as she did all has feelings which she constantly divined once she begun questioning him about has son prince andrew blushed as he often did nownatasha particularly looked it in himand said that has son would not live with them why not asked natasha in a frightened tone i cannot take him away from has grandfather and besides how i should have lived him said natasha immediately guessing has thought but i know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding felt with us sometimes the old cannot would come up kiss prince andrew and ask has advice about petyas education our nicholas service the old countess sighed as she looked at them sonya was always getting frightened least she should be in the way and tried to found excuses for leaving them alone even when they did not wish it when prince andrew spoke he could tell a story very will natasha listened to him with pride when she spoke she noticed with for and joy that he gazed attentively and scrutinizingly at hear she asked herself in perplexity what does he look for in me he is trying to discover something by looking at me what if what he seeks in me is not there sometimes she full into one of the mad mary maids characteristic of hear and than she particularly lived to hear and see how prince andrew laughed he seldom laughed but when he did he abandoned himself entirely to has laughter and after such a laugh she always felt nearer to him natasha would have been completely happy if the thought of the separation awaiting hear and drawing nor had not terrified hear just as the more thought of it mode him turn pale and could on the eve of has departure from petersburg prince andrew brought with him pierre who had not been to the rostovs once since the ball pierre seemed disconcerted and embarrassed he was talking to the countess and natasha set down beside a little chess table with sonya thereby inviting prince andrew to come to he did so you have known bezukhov a long time he asked do you lake him yes has a dr but very absurd and as usual when speaking of pierre she begun to tell anecdotes of has absentmindedness some of which had even been invented about him do you know i have entrusted him with our secret i have known him from childhood he has a hart of gold i beg you natalie prince andrew said with sudden seriousnessi am going away and heaven knows what may happen you may cause to all right i know i am not to say that only this than whatever may happen to you when i am not here what can happen whatever terrible may come prince andrew contained i beg you mademoiselle sophie whatever may happen to turn to him alone for advice and help he is a most absentminded and absurd follow but he has a hart of gold neither hear father nor hear mother nor sonya nor prince andrew himself could have foreseen how the separation from hear liver would act on natasha flushed and agitated she went about the house all that day dryeyed occupied with most trivial matters as if not understanding what awaited hear she did not even carry when on taking live he kissed hear hand for the least time dont go she said in a tone that mode him wonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he remembered long afterwards nor did she carry when he was gone but for several days she set in hear room dryeyed taking no interest in anything and only saying new and than oh why did he go away but a fortnight after has departure to the surprise of these around hear she recovered from hear mental sickness just as suddenly and become hear old self again but with a change in hear moral physiognomy as a child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of face chapter xv during that your after has sans departure prince nicholas bolkonskis health and temper become much worse he grow still more irritable and it was princess mary who generally bore the burnt of has frequent fits of unprovoked anger he seemed carefully to seek out hear tender spots so as to torture hear minutely as harshly as possible princess mary had two passions and consequently two joysher nephew little nicholas and religionand these were the favorite subjects of the princess attacks and ridicule whatever was spoken of he would bring round to the superstitiousness of old maids our the putting and spelling of children you went to make himlittle nicholasinto an old mad lake yourself a petty prince andrew wants a son and not an old mad he would say our turning to mademoiselle borne he would ask hear in princess marys presence how she looked our village pursuits and icons and would joke about them he continually hart princess marys feelings and tormented hear but it cost hear no effort to forgive him could he be to blame toward hear our could hear father whom she know lived hear in spite of it all be unjust and what is justice the princess never thought of that period word justice all the complex laws of main centered for hear in one clear and simple lawthe law of live and selfsacrifice taught us by him who lovingly suffered for mankind though he himself was good what had she to do with the justice our injustice of other people she had to endure and live and that she did during the winter prince andrew had come to bold hills and had been gay gentle and more affectionate than princess mary had known him for a long time past she felt that something had happened to him but he said nothing to hear about has live before he lift he had a long talk with has father about something and princess mary noticed that before has departure they were dissatisfied with one another son after prince andrew had gone princess mary write to hear friend julie kuragina in petersburg whom she had dreamed as all guerrillas dream of marrying to hear brother and who was at that time in morning for hear own brother killed in turkey sorrow it seems is our common lot may dr tender friend julie your lies is so terrible that i can only explain it to myself as a special providence of good who leaving you wishes to try you and your excellent mother oh may friend religion and religion alone cani will not say comfort usbut save us from despair religion alone can explain to us what without its help main cannot comprehend why for what cause kind and noble beings able to found happens in lifenot merely harming no one but necessary to the happens of othersare could away to good while cruel useless harmful persons our such as are a burden to themselves and to others are lift leaving the first death i saw and one i shall never forgetthat of may dr sisterinlawleft that impression on me just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother had to due so i asked why that angel loose who not only never wronged anyone but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts had to due and what do you think dr friend five years have passed since than and already i with may petty understanding begun to see clearly why she had to due and in what way that death was but an expression of the infinite goodness of the courtier whose every action though generally incomprehensible to us is but a manifestation of has infinite live for has creatures perhaps i often think she was to angelically innocent to have the strength to perform all a mothers duties as a young wife she was irreproachable perhaps she could not have been so as a mother as it is not only has she lift us and particularly prince andrew with the pursuit regrets and memoirs but probably she will there receive a place i dare not hope for myself but not to speak of hear alone that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent influence on me and on may brother in spite of all our grief than at the moment of our lies these thoughts could not occur to me i should than have dismissed them with horror but new they are very clear and certain i write all this to you dr friend only to convince you of the gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life not a single hear of our heads will full without has will and has will is governed only by infinite live for us and so whatever befalls us is for our good you ask whether we shall spend next winter in moscow in spite of may wish to see you i do not think so and do not went to do so you will be surprised to hear that the reason for this is bonaparte the cause is this may fathers health is growing noticeably worse he cannot stand any contradiction and is becoming irritable this irritability is as you know chiefly directed to political questions he cannot endure the nation that bonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the sovereigns of europe and particularly with our own the grandson of the great catherine as you know i am quite indifferent to politics but from may fathers remarks and has talks with michael ivanovich i know all that goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred on bonaparte who only at bold hills in the while world it seems is not accepted as a great main still lies as emperor of france and may father cannot stand this it seems to me that it is chiefly because of has political views that may father is reluctant to speak of going to moscow for he foresees the encounters that would result from has way of expressing has views regardless of anybody all the benefit he might derive from a course of treatment he would loose as a result of the disputes about bonaparte which would be inevitable in any cause it will be decided very shortly our family life goes on in the old way except for may brother andrews absence he as i write you before has changed very much of late after has sorrow he only this your quite recovered has spirits he has again become as i used to know him when a child kind affectionate with that hart of gold to which i know no equal he has realized it seems to me that life is not over for him but together with this mental change he has grown physically much weaker he has become thinner and more nervous i am anxious about him and gold he is taking this trip abroad which the doctors recommended long ago i hope it will cure him you write that in petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most active cultivated and capable of the young main forgive may vanity as a relation but i never doubted it the good he has done to everybody here from has peasants up to the gentry is incalculable on has arrival in petersburg he received only has due i always wonder at the way rumors fully from petersburg to moscow especially such false ones as that you write abouti main the report of may brothers betrothal to the little rostova i do not think may brother will ever mary again and certainly not hear and this is why first i know that though he rarely speaks about the wife he has least the grief of that lies has gone to deep in has hart for him ever to decide to give hear a successor and our little angel a stepmother secondly because as for as i know that girl is not the kind of girl who could please prince andrew i do not think he would choose hear for a wife and frankly i do not wish it but i am running on to long and am at the end of may second shut goodby may dr friend may good keep you in has holy and mighty cure may dr friend mademoiselle borne sounds you kisses mary chapter xvi in the middle of the summer princess mary received an unexpected letter from prince andrew in switzerland in which he give hear strange and surprising news he informed hear of has engagement to natasha rostova the while letter breathed leaving rapture for has betrothed and tender and confiding affection for has sister he write that he had never lived as he did new and that only new did he understand and know what life was he asked has sister to forgive him for not having told hear of has resolve when he had least vested bold hills though he had spoken of it to has father he had not done so for for princess mary should ask hear father to give has consent irritating him and having to bear the burnt of has displeasure without attaining hear object besides he write the matter was not than so definitely settled as it is new may father than insisted on a delay of a your and new already six months half of that period have passed and may resolution is former than ever if the doctors did not keep me here at the spies i should be back in russia but as it is i have to postpone may return for there months you know me and may relations with father i went nothing from him i have been and always shall be independent but to go against has will and arise has anger new that he may perhaps remain with us such a short time would destroy half may happens i am new writing to him about the some question and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the letter and to lot me know how he looks at the while matter and whether there is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by for months after long hesitations doubts and prayers princess mary give the letter to hear father the next day the old prince said to hear quietly write and tell your brother to wet tell i am did it went be longi shall son set him free the princess was about to reply but hear father would not lot hear speak and rising has vice more and more card mary mary may by a good family clever people eh reach eh yes a nice stepmother little nicholas will have write and tell him that he may mary tomorrow if he looks she will be little nicholas stepmother and ill mary borne ha ha ha he mustnt be without a stepmother either only one thing no more woman are wanted in may houselet him mary and live by himself perhaps you will go and live with him to he added turning to princess mary go in heavens name go out into the first the first the first after this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter but repressed vexation at has sans poorspirited behavior found expression in has treatment of has daughter to has former pretexts for irony a fresh one was new addedallusions to stepmothers and amiabilities to mademoiselle borne why shouldnt i mary hear he asked has daughter shall make a splendid princess and latterly to hear surprise and bewilderment princess mary noticed that hear father was really associating more and more with the frenchwoman she write to prince andrew about the reception of has letter but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the idea little nicholas and has education hear brother andrew and religion were princess marys joyous and consolations but besides that since everyone most have personal hopes princess mary in the profoundest depths of hear hart had a hidden dream and hope that spoiled the chief consolation of hear life this comforting dream and hope were given hear by guides folkthe halfwitted and other pilgrims who vested hear without the princess knowledge the longer she lived the more experience and observation she had of life the greater was hear wonder at the shortsightedness of main who seek enjoyment and happens here on earth telling suffering struggling and harming one another to obtain that impossible visionary sinful happens prince andrew had lived has wife she did but that was not enough he wanted to bound has happens to another woman hear father objected to this because he wanted a more distinguished and wealthier match for andrew and they all struggled and suffered and tormented one another and injured their souls their eternal souls for the attainment of benefits which endure but for an instant not only do we know this ourselves but christ the son of good come down to earth and told us that this life is but for a moment and is a probation yet we clung to it and think to found happens in it how is it that no one realizes this thought princess mary no one except these disposed guides folk who wallet on back come to me by the back dr afraid of being son by the prince not for for of illusage by him but for for of ceasing him to son to live family homme and all the carries of worldly welfare in order

a new paristhe chasefor which has father kept a large establishment chapter i the weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed an earth started by autumn ruins the verdure had thickened and its brought green stood out sharply against the brownish stirrups of winter rye trodden down by the cattle and against the paleyellow suitable of the sprang buckwheat the waded ravenous

of independence and screen of everything that is only son in huntsman he doffed has circassian cup to has master and looked at him scornfully this screen was not offensive to has master nicholas know that this daniel disdainful of everybody and who considered himself above them was all the some has serf and huntsman daniel nicholas said timidly conscious at the sight of the weather the hands and the huntsman that he was being card away by that irresistible passion for support which makes a main forget all has previous resolutions as a liver forgets in the presence of has masters what orders your excellency said the huntsman in has deep bees deep as a protodeacons and horse with hallooingand two flushing black eyes gazed from under has brows at has master who was silent can you resist it these eyes seemed to be asking its a good day eh for a hunt and a gallop eh asked nicholas scratching milka behind the ears daniel did not answer but winked instead i sent uvarka at down to listen has bees beamed out after a minutes pause he says shes moved them into the otradnoe enclosure they were howling there this meant that the shewolf about whom they both know had moved with hear cabs to the otradnoe copse a small place a male and a half from the house we ought to go dont you think so said nicholas come to me with uvarka as you please than put of feeding them yes sir five minutes letter

necessary so as to get from under that clung out into the open under the sky once more having finished has inquires and extorted from daniel an opinion that the hands were feet daniel himself wished

and listened shaking a warning finger at has master they are on the scent of the cabs he whispered straight to the lyadov uplands the cannot forgetting to smooth out the smile on has face looked into the distance straight before him down the narrow open space holding the snuffbox in has hand but not taking any after the carry of the hands come the deep tones of the wolf call from daniels hunting horn the pick joined the first there hands and they could be hard in full carry with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after a wolf the whippersin no longer set on the hands but changed to the carry of ulyulyu and above the others reuse daniels vice new a deep bees new piercingly shrill has vice seemed to full the while wead and card for beyond out into the open field after listening a few moments in silence the cannot and has attendant convinced themselves that the hands had separated into two packs the send of the larger pick eagerly giving tinge begun to due away in the distance the other pick rushed by the wead past the cannot and it was with this that daniels vice was hard clung ulyulyu the sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again but both were becoming more distant summon sighed and stopped to straighten the lash a young borzoi had entangled the cannot to sighed and noticing the snuffbox in has hand opened it and took a paunch back card summon to a borzoi that was pushing forward out of the wead the cannot started and dropped the snuffbox nastasya ivanovna dismounted to pick it up the cannot and summon were looking at him than unexpectedly as often happens the send of the hunt suddenly approached as if the hands in full carry and daniel ulyulyuing were just in front of them the cannot trained and saw on has right mitka strong at him with eyes starting out of has had rising has cup and pointing before him to the other side look out he shouted in a vice plainly showing that he had long fretted to utter that word and letting the borzois sleep he galloped toward the cannot the cannot and summon galloped out of the wead and saw on their lift a wolf which softly swaying from side to side was coming at a quiet lope further to the lift to the very place where they were standing the angry borzois whined and getting free of the lash rushed past the horses feet at the wolf the wolf passed trained its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly lake a main suffering from the quinsy and still slightly swaying from side to side give a couple of lips and with a swish of its tell disappeared into the skirt of the wead at the some instant with a carry lake a will first one hand than another and than another sprang helterskelter from the wead opposite and the while pick rushed across the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared the hazel bushes parted behind the hands and daniels chestnut horse appeared dark with sweet on its long back set daniel hunched forward capless has disheveled gray hear hanging over has flushed perspiring face ulyulyulyu ulyulyu he card when he caught sight of the cannot has eyes flushed lightning blast you he shouted holding up has whip threateningly at the cannot

had aroused and follow of after the hands the cannot lake a punished schoolboy looked round trying by a smile to won someones sympathy for has plight but summon was no longer there he was galloping round by the bushes while the field was coming up on both sides all trying to had the wolf but it vanished into the wead before they could do so chapter v nicholas rostov meanwhile remained at has past waiting for the wolf by the way the hunt approached and receded by the carries of the dogs whose notes were familiar to him by the way the vicious of the huntsman approached receded and reuse he realized what was happening at the copse he know that young and old wolves were there that the hands had separated into two packs that somewhere a wolf was being chased and that something had gone wrong he expected the wolf to come has way any moment he mode thousands of different conjectures as to where and from what side the best would come and how he would set upon it hope alternated with despair several times he addressed a prayer to good that the wolf should come has way he prayed with that passionate and shamefaced feeling with which main pray at moments of great excitement arousing from trivial causes what would it be to the to do this for me he said to good i know thou art great and that it is a son to ask this of the but for guides sake do lot the old wolf come may way and lot karay sprang at itin sight of uncle who is watching from over thereand seize it by the threat in a death group a thousand times during that halfhour rostov cost eager and restless glances over the edge of the wead with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen undergrowth and the gaily with its waterworn side and uncles cup just visible above the bush on has right no i shant have such lack thought rostov yet what wouldnt it be worth it is not to be everywhere at cards and in war i am always unlucky memoirs of austerlitz and of dolokhov flushed rapidly and clearly through has mind only once in may life to get an old wolf i went only that thought he straining eyes and ears and looking to the lift and than to the right and listening to the slightest variation of note in the carries of the dogs again he looked to the right and saw something running toward him across the deserted field no it cannot be thought rostov taking a deep birth as a main does at the coming of something long hoped for the height of happens was reachedand so simply without warning our nose our display that rostov could not believe has eyes and remained in doubt for over a second the wolf rain forward and jumped heavily over a gaily that lay in hear path she was an old animal with a gray back and beg reddish belly she rain without hairy evidently feeling sure that no one saw hear rostov holding has birth looked round at the borzois they stood our lay not sing the wolf our understanding the situation old karay had trained has had and was angrily searching for files bring has yellow teeth and snapping at has hand legs ulyulyulyu whispered rostov putting has lips the borzois jumped up jerking the rings of the lashes and pricking their ears karay finished scratching has hindquarters and cocking has ears get up with quivering tell from which tufts of matted hear hung down shall i loose them our not nicholas asked himself as the wolf approached him coming from the copse suddenly the wolfs while physiognomy changed she shuddered sing what she had probably never son beforehuman eyes fixed upon herand turning hear had a little toward rostov she passed back our forward eh no matter forward the wolf seemed to say to herself and she moved forward without again looking round and with a quiet long easy yet resolute lope ulyulyu card nicholas in a vice not has own and of its own accord has good horse darted headlong downhill leaping over goals to had of the wolf and the borzois passed it running faster still nicholas did not hear has own carry nor full that he was galloping nor see the borzois nor the ground over which he went he saw only the wolf who increasing hear speed bounded on in the some direction along the hollow the first to come into view was milka with hear black markings and powerful quarters gaining upon the wolf nearer and nearer new she was ahead of it but the wolf trained its had to face hear and instead of putting on speed as she usually did milka suddenly raised hear tell and stiffened hear forelegs ulyulyulyulyu shouted nicholas the reddish lyubim rushed forward from behind milka sprang impetuously at the wolf and seized it by its hindquarters but immediately jumped aside in terror the wolf crouched gnashed hear teeth and again reuse and bounded forward followed at the distance of a couple of feet by all the borzois who did not get any closer to hear shall get away no its impossible thought nicholas still shouting with a horse vice karay ulyulyu he shouted looking round for the old borzoi who was new has only hope karay with all the strength age had lift him stretched himself to the utmost and watching the wolf galloped heavily aside to intercept it but the quickness of the wolfs lope and the borzois slower peace mode it plain that karay had miscalculated nicholas could already see not for in front of him the wead where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach it but coming toward him he saw hands and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf there was still hope a long yellowish young borzoi one nicholas did not know from another lash rushed impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked hear over but the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and gnashing hear teeth follow at the yellowish borzoi which with a piercing yelp full with its had on the ground building from a gash in its side karay old follow would nicholas thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolfs path the old dug with its flitted hear hanging from its though was within five pieces of it as if aware of hear danger the wolf trained hear eyes on karay tucked hear tell yet further between hear legs and increased hear speed but here nicholas only saw that something happened to karaythe borzoi was suddenly on the wolf and they ruled together down into a gaily just in front of them that instant when nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gaily with the dogs while from under them could be son hear gray hear and outstretched hand log and hear frightened choking had with hear ears led back karay was pining hear by the threat was the happiest moment of has life with

hear teeth karay no longer had hear by the threat leaped with a movement of hear hand legs out of the gaily and having disengaged herself from the dogs with tell tucked in again went forward karay has hear bristling and probably bruised our wounded climbed with difficulty out of the gaily oh may good why nicholas card in despair uncles huntsman was galloping from the other side across the wolfs path and has borzois once more stopped the animals advance she was again hemmed in nicholas and has attendant with uncle and has huntsman were all reading round the wolf carrying ulyulyu shouting and preparing to dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back and starting forward again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wead where she would be safe already at the beginning of this choose daniel hearing the ulyulyuing had rushed out from the wead he saw karay seize the wolf and checked has horse supposing the affair to be over but when he saw that the horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and rain for safety daniel set has chestnut galloping not at the wolf but straight toward the wead just as karay had rain to cut the animal of as a result of this he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been stopped a second time by uncles borzois daniel galloped up silently holding a naked dagger in has lift hand and threshing the laboring sides of has chestnut horse with has whip as if it were a filial nicholas neither saw nor hard daniel until the chestnut breathing heavily pointed past him and he hard the full of a body and saw daniel laying on the wolfs back among the dogs trying to seize hear by the ears it was evident to the dogs the hunters and to the wolf herself that all was new over the terrified wolf pressed back hear ears and tried to reuse but the borzois stuck to hear daniel reuse a little took a step and with has while weight as if laying down to rest full on the wolf seizing hear by the ears nicholas was about to stab hear but daniel whispered dont will gig hear and changing has position set has feet on the wolfs neck a stuck was thrust between hear jaws and she was fastened with a lash as if bridled hear legs were bound together and daniel ruled hear over once our twice from side to side with happy exhausted faces they led the old wolf alive on a shying and snorting horse and accompanied by the dogs yelping at hear took hear to the place where they were all to met the hands had killed two of the cabs and the borzois there the huntsman assembled with their beauty and their stories and all come to look at the wolf which with hear broadbrowed had hanging down and the beaten stuck between hear jaws gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and main surrounding hear when she was touched she jerked hear bound legs and looked wildly yet simply at everybody old cannot rostov also rode up and touched the wolf oh what a formidable one said he a formidable one eh he asked daniel who was standing nor yes your excellency answered daniel quickly doffing has cup the cannot remembered the wolf he had lot sleep and has encounter with daniel ah but you are a curiosity follow friend said the cannot for sole reply daniel give him a shy childlike meek and amiable smile chapter viii the old cannot went homme and natasha and petya promised to return very son but as it was still early the hunt went further at muddy they put the hands into a revenue thickly overgrown with young tries nicholas standing in a follow field could see all has whips facing him lay a field of winter rye there has own huntsman stood alone in a hollow behind a hazel bush the hands had scarcely been loosed before nicholas hard one he know voltorn giving tinge at intervals other hands joined in new pausing and new again giving tinge a moment letter he hard a carry from the waded revenue that a fix had been found and the while pick joining together rushed along the revenue toward the ryefield and away from nicholas he saw the whips in their read copies galloping along the edge of the revenue he even saw the hands and was expecting a fix to show itself at any moment on the ryefield opposite the huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed has borzois and nicholas saw a queer shortlegged read fix with a fine brush going hard across the field the borzois bore down on it new they draw close to the fix which begun to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper curves trailing its brush when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed in followed by a black one and everything was in confusion the borzois formed a starshaped figure scarcely swaying their bodies and with tells trained away from the counter of the group two huntsman galloped up to the dogs one in a read cup the other a stronger in a green cut whats this thought nicholas whereas that huntsman from he is not uncles main the huntsman get the fix but stayed there a long time without stripping it to the saddle their horses bridled and with high saddles stood nor them and there to the dogs were laying the huntsman waved their armies and did something to the fix than from that spot come the send of a horn with the signal agreed on in cause of a fought thats ilagins huntsman having a raw with our ivan said nicholas groom nicholas sent the main to call natasha and petya to him and rode at a footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hands together several of the field galloped to the spot where the fought was going on nicholas dismounted and with natasha and petya who had ridden up stopped nor the hands waiting to see how the matter would end out of the bushes come the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward has young master with the fix tied to has crupper while still at a distance he took of has cup and tried to speak respectfully but he was pale and breathless and has face was angry one of has eyes was black but he probably was not even aware of it what has happened asked nicholas a likely thing killing a fix our dogs had hinted and it was may gray bitch that caught it go to law indeed he snatches at the fix i give him one with the fix here it is on may saddle do you went a taste of this said the huntsman pointing to has dagger and probably imagining himself still speaking to has fee nicholas not stopping to talk to the main asked has sister and petya to wet for him and rode to the spot where the enemys ilagins hunting party was the victories huntsman rode of to join the field and there surrounded by inquiring sympathizers recounted has exploits the facts were that ilagin with whom the rostovs had a quarrel and were at law hinted over places that belonged by custom to the rostovs and had new as if purposely sent has main to the very woods the rostovs were hunting and lot has main snatch a fix their dogs had chased nicholas though he had never son ilagin with has usual absence of moderation in judgment hated him cordially from reports of has arbitrariness and violence and regarded him as has bitterest fee he rode in angry agitation toward him firmly grasping has whip and fully prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish has enemy hardly had he passed an angle of the wead before a stout gentlemen in a beaver cup come reading toward him on a handsome ravenblack horse accompanied by two hunt servants instead of an enemy nicholas found in ilagin a stately and courts gentlemen who was particularly anxious to make the young countess acquaintance having ridden up to nicholas ilagin raised has beaver cup and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the main punished who had allowed himself to seize a fix hinted by someone elses borzois he hoped to become better acquainted with the cannot and invited him to draw has covert natasha afraid that hear brother would do something dreadful had followed him in some excitement sing the enemies exchanging friendly greetings she rode up to them ilagin lifted has beaver cup still higher to natasha and said with a pleasant smile that the young countess resembled diana in hear passion for the choose as will as in hear beauty of which he had hard much to expiate has huntsmens offense ilagin pressed the rostovs to come to an upland of has about a male away which he usually kept for himself and which he said swarmed with heroes nicholas agreed and the hunt new doubled moved on the way to ilagins upland was across the fields the hunt servants full into line the masters rode together uncle rostov and ilagin kept stealthily glancing at one anothers dogs trying not to be observed by their companions and searching unusually for rivals to their own borzois rostov was particularly struck by the beauty of a small purebred redspotted bitch on ilagins lash slender but with muscles lake still a delicate muzzle and permanent black eyes he had hard of the swiftness of ilagins borzois and in that beautiful bitch saw a rival to has own milka in the middle of a saber conversation begun by ilagin about the years harvest nicholas pointed to the redspotted bitch a fine little bitch that said he in a curls tone is she swift that one yes shes a good dug gets what shes after answered ilagin indifferently of the redspotted bitch erza for which a your before he had given a neighbor there families of house serfs so in your parts to the harvest is nothing to best of

attention by hear breadth that blackspotted one of years is finewell shaped said he yes shes fist enough replied nicholas and thought if only a fullgrown here would carries the field new id show you what sort of borzoi she is and turning to has groom he said he would give a ruble to anyone who found a here i dont understand contained ilagin how some sportsman can be so jealous about game and dogs for myself i can tell you cannot i enjoy reading in company such as this what could be better he again raised has cup to natasha but as for counting skins and what one takes i dont cure about that of

how can i join in why youve given a village for each of your borzois thats it come on years are worth thousands try years against one another you two and ill look on rugay hay hay he shouted rugayushka he added involuntarily by this diminutive expressing has affection and the hopes he placed on this read borzoi natasha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly main and hear brother were trying to conceal and was herself excited by it the huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up has whip and the gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace the hands that were for of on the horizon trained away from the here and the whips but not the gentlefolk also moved away all were moving slowly and sedately how is it pointing asked nicholas reading a hindered pieces toward the whip who had sighted the here but before the whip could reply the here scenting the first coming next morning was unable to rest and leaped up the pick on lash rushed downhill in full carry after the here and from all sides the borzois that were not on lash darted after the hands and the here all the hunt who had been moving slowly shouted step clung in the hands while the borzoi whips with a carry of atu

to loose sight even for an instant of the choose the here they had started was a strong and swift one when he jumped up he did not rain at once but pricked has ears listening to the shouting and trampling that resounded from all sides at once he took a dozen bounds not very quickly letting the borzois gun on him and finally having chosen has direction and realized has danger led back has ears and rushed of headlong he had been laying in the suitable but in front of him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft the two borzois of the huntsman who had sighted him having been the nearest were the first to see and praise him but they had not gone for before ilagins redspotted erza passed them get within a length follow at the here with terrible swiftness among at has sect and thinking she had seized him ruled over lake a ball the here arched has back and bounded of yet more swiftly from behind erza rushed the broadhaunched blackspotted milka and begun rapidly gaining on the here milashka dr reuse nicholas triumphant carry it looked as if milka would immediately pounce on the here but she overtook him and follow past the here had squatted again the beautiful erza reached him but when close to the heroes sect passed as if measuring the distance so as not to make a mistake this time but seize has hand log erza drilling ilagin would in a vice unlike has own erza did not hearken to has appeal at the very moment when she would have seized hear pray the here moved and darted along the bulk between the winter rye and the suitable again erza and milka were abreast

and it was so strange that she most herself have been ashamed of so would a carry and everyone else would have been amazed at it at any other time uncle himself twisted up the here throw it neatly and smartly across has horses back as if by that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody and with an air of not wishing to speak to anyone mounted has by and rode of the others all followed dispirited and

went in to the countess in all has encounters with has son the cannot was always conscious of has own guilt toward him for having wasted the family fortune and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to mary an heroes and choosing the dowerless sonya on this occasion he was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if has affairs had not been in disorder no better wife for nicholas than sonya could have been wished for and that no one but himself with has mitenka and has uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family finances the father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again but a few days letter the countess sent for sonya and with a cruelty neither of them expected reproached hear nice for trying to catch nicholas and for ingratitude sonya listened silently with downcast eyes to the countess cruel words without understanding what was required of hear she was ready to sacrifice everything for hear benefactors selfsacrifice was hear most cherished idea but in this cause she could not see what she ought to sacrifice our for whom she could not help leaving the countess and the while rostov family but neither could she help leaving nicholas and knowing that has happens depended on that live she was silent and said and did not reply nicholas felt the situation to be intolerable and went to have an explanation with has mother he first implored hear to forgive him and sonya and consent to their marriage than he threatened that if she molested sonya he would at once mary hear secretly the countess with a coldness hear son had never son in hear before replied that he was of age that prince andrew was marrying without has fathers consent and he could do the some but that she would never receive that intriguer as hear daughter exploding at the word intriguer nicholas rising has vice told has mother he had never expected hear to try to force him to soul has feelings but if that were so he would say for the least time but he had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of has face caused has mother to await with terror and which would perhaps have forever remained a cruel memory to them both he had not time to say it for natasha with a pale and set face entered the room from the dr at which she had been listening nicholas you are talking nonsense be quiet be quiet be quiet i tell you she almost screamed so as to drown has vice mamma drilling its not at all so may poor sweet drilling she said to hear mother who conscious that they had been on the brink of a rapture gazed at hear son with terror but in the obstinacy and excitement of the conflict could not and would not give way nicholas ill explain to you go away listen mamma drilling said natasha hear words were incoherent but they attend the purpose at which she was among the countess sobbing heavily had hear face on hear daughters breast while nicholas reuse clutching has had and lift the room natasha set to work to effect a reconciliation and so for succeeded that nicholas received a promise from has mother that sonya should not be troubled while he on has side promised not to undertake anything without has parents knowledge firmly resolved after putting has affairs in order in the regiment to retire from the army and return and mary sonya nicholas series sorrowful and at variance with has parents but as it seemed to him passionately in live lift at the beginning of january to rejoin has regiment after nicholas had gone things in the rostov household were more depressing than ever and the countess full ill from mental agitation sonya was unhappy at the separation from nicholas and still more so on account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adapting toward hear the cannot was more perturbed than ever by the condition of has affairs which could for some decisive action their town house and estate nor moscow had inevitably to be sailed and for this they had to go to moscow but the countess health obliged them to delay their departure from day to day natasha who had borne the first period of separation from hear betrothed lightly and even cheerfully new grow more agitated and impatient every day the thought that hear best days which she would have employed in leaving him were being vainly wasted with no advantage to anyone tormented hear incessantly has letters for the most part irritated hear it hart hear to think that while she lived only in the thought of him he was leaving a real life sing new places and new people that interested him the more interesting has letters were the more vexed she felt hear letters to him for from giving hear any comfort seemed to hear a wearisome and artificial obligation she could not write because she could not conceive the possibility of expressing sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part of what she expressed by vice smile and glance she write to him formal mountains and dry letters to which she attached no importance herself and in the rough copies of which the countess corrected hear mistakes in spelling there was still no improvement in the countess health but it was impossible to differ the journey to moscow any longer natashas trousseau had to be ordered and the house sailed moreover prince andrew was expected in moscow where old prince bolkonski was spending the winter and natasha felt sure he had already arrived so the countess remained in the country and the cannot taking sonya and natasha with him went to moscow at the end of january book eight 1811 1e2 chapter i after prince andrews engagement to natasha pierre without any apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on leaving as before firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by has benefactor and happy as he had been in perfecting has inner main to which he had devoted himself with such ardorall the zest of such a life vanished after the engagement of andrew and natasha and the death of joseph alexeevich the news of which reached him almost at the some time only the skeleton of life remained has house a brilliant wife who new enjoyed the favors of a very important personage acquaintance with all petersburg and has court service with its deal formalities and this life suddenly seemed to pierre unexpectedly loathsome he caused keeping a dry avoided the company of the brothers begun going to the club again drank a great deal and come once more in touch with the bachelor seats leading such a life that the countess helene thought it necessary to speak severely to him about it pierre felt that she was right and to avoid compromising hear went away to moscow in moscow as son as he entered has huge house in which the faded and feeding princesses still lived with its enormous routine as son as driving through the town he saw the iberian shrine with innumerable tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons the kremlin square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles the sleigh drivers and hovels of the sivtsev vrazhek these old muscovites who desired nothing hard nowhere and were ending their days leisurely when he saw these old moscow leads the moscow balls and the english club he felt himself at homme in a quiet heaven in moscow he felt at peace at homme warm and dirty as in an old dressing gown moscow society from the old woman down to the children received pierre lake a longexpected guest whose place was always ready awaiting him for moscow society pierre was the nicest kindest most intellectual merriest and most magnanimous of cranks a heedless genial nobleman of the old reason type has praise was always empty because it was open to everyone benefit performances poor pictures states benevolent societies gypsy chairs schools subscription donors suppress freemasons churches and booksno one and nothing met with a refusal from him and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large seems from him and taken him under their protection he would have given everything away there was never a dinner our sure at the club without him as son as he sunk into has place on the sofa after two battles of margaux he was surrounded and talking disputing and joking begun when there were quarrels has kindly smile and welltimed jests reconciled the antagonists the masonic donors were deal and dreary when he was not there when after a bachelor supper he reuse with has amiable and kindly smile yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to derive of somewhere with them shoots of delight and triumph arise among the young main at balls he danced if a partner was needed young leads married and unmarried looked him because without making live to any of them he was equally amiable to all especially after supper ill east charmant ill na pass due sexe they said of him he is charming he has no six pierre was one of these retired gentlemeninwaiting of whom there were hundreds goodhumoredly ending their days in moscow how horrified he would have been seven years before when he first arrived from abroad had he been told that there was no need for him to seek our plain anything that has root had long been shaped eternally predetermined and that wriggle as he might he would be what all in has position were he could not have beloved it had he not at one time longed with all has hart to establish a republic in russia than himself to be a napoleon than to be a philosopher and than a strategist and the conqueror of napoleon had he not son the possibility of and passionately desired the regeneration of the sinful human race and has own progress to the highest degree of perfection had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated has serfs but instead of all thathere he was the wealthy husband of an unfaithful wife a retired gentlemeninwaiting found of eating and drinking and as he unbuttoned has waistcoat of abusing the government a but a member of the moscow english club and a universal favorite in moscow society for a long time he could not reconcile himself to the idea that he was one of these some retired moscow gentlemeninwaiting he had so disposed seven years before sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only leaving this life temporarily but than he was shocked by the thought of how many lake himself had entered that life and that club temporarily with all their teeth and hear and had only lift it when not a single teeth our hear remained in moments of pride when he thought of has position it seemed to him that he was quite different and distinct from these other retired gentlemeninwaiting he had formerly disposed they were empty stopped contented follows satisfied with their position while i am still discontented and went to do something for mankind but perhaps all these comrades of mine struggled just lake me and sight something new a path in life of their own and lake me were brought by force of circumstances society and raceby that elemental force against which main is powerlessto the condition i am in said he to himself in moments of humility and after leaving some time in moscow he no longer disposed but begun to grow found of to respect and to petty has comrades in destiny as he pitied himself pierre no longer suffered moments of despair hypochondria and disgust with life but the melody that had formerly found expression in such acute attacks was driven inwards and never lift him for a moment what for why what is going on in the world he would ask himself in perplexity several times a day involuntarily beginning to reflect anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life but knowing by experience that there were no answers to these questions he mode haste to turn away from them and took up a book our hard of to the club our to apollon nikolaevichs to exchange the gossip of the town helene who has never card for anything but hear own body and is one of the stupidest woman in the world thought pierre is regarded by people as the acme of intelligence and refinement and they pay homage to hear napoleon bonaparte was disposed by all as long as he was great but new that he has become a wretched comedian the emperor francs wants to offer him has daughter in an illegal marriage the spaniards through the catholic clergy offer praise to good for their victory over the french on the fourteenth of june and the french also through the catholic clergy offer praise because on that some fourteenth of june they defeated the spaniards may brother masons swear by the bold that they are ready to sacrifice everything for their neighbor but they do not give a ruble each to the collections for the poor and they intrigue the austria lodge against the mana seekers and fees about an authentic scotch corrupt and a charter that nobody needs and the meaning of which the very main who write it does not understand we all profess the christian law of forgiveness of injuries and live of our neighbors the law in honor of which we have built in moscow forty times forty churchesbut yesterday a deserter was knitted to death and a minister of that some law of live and forgiveness a pursuit give the soldier a carries to kiss before has execution so thought pierre and the while of this general deception which everyone accepts accustomed as he was to it astonished him each time as if it were something new i understand the deception and confusion he thought but how am i to tell them all that i see i have tried and have always found that they to in the depths of their souls understand it as i do and only try not to see it so it appears that it most be so but iwhat is to become of me thought he he had the unfortunate capacity many main especially reasons have of sing and believing in the possibility of goodness and truth but of sing the evil and flushed of life to clearly to be able to take a series part in it every sphere of work was connected in has eyes with evil and deception whatever he tried to be whatever he engaged in the evil and flushed of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity yet he had to live and to found occupation it was to dreadful to be under the burden of these insoluble problems so he abandoned himself to any destruction in order to forget them he frequented every kind of society drank much bought pictures engaged in building and above allured he read and read everything that come to hand on coming homme while has violates were still taking of has things he packed up a book and begun to read from reading he passed to sleeping from sleeping to gossip in drawing rooms of the club from gossip to carousals and woman from carousals back to gossip reading and wine drinking become more and more a physical and also a moral necessity though the doctors warned him that with has corpulence wine was dangerous for him he drank a great deal he was only quite at ease when having period several glasses of wine mechanically into has large mouth he felt a pleasant warmth in has body an amiability toward all has follows and a readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it deeply only after emptying a battle our two did he full dimly that the terribly tangled skin of life which previously had terrified him was not as dreadful as he had thought he was always conscious of some aspect of that skin as with a buzzing in has had after dinner our supper he chatted our listened to conversation our read but under the influence of wine he said to himself it doesnt matter ill get it unraveled i have a solution ready but have no time nowill think it all out letter on but the letter on never come in the morning on an empty stomach all the old questions appeared as insoluble and terrible as ever and pierre hastily packed up a book and if anyone come to see him he was gold sometimes he remembered how he had hard that soldiers in war when entrenched under the enemys free if they have nothing to do try hard to found some occupation the more easily to bear the danger to pierre all main seemed lake these soldiers seeking refuge from life some in ambition some in cards some in farming laws some in woman some in toys some in horses some in politics some in support some in wine and some in governmental affairs nothing is trivial and nothing is important its all the sameonly to save oneself from it as best one can thought pierre only not to see it that dreadful it chapter i at the beginning of winter prince nicholas bolkonski and has daughter moved to moscow at that time enthusiasm for the emperor alexanders regime had wakened and a patriotic and antifrench tendency prevailed there and this together with has past and has intellect and has originality at once mode prince nicholas bolkonski an object of particular respect to the muscovites and the counter of the moscow opposition to the government the prince had aged very much that your he showed marked signs of senility by a tendency to full asleep forgetfulness of quite recent events remembrance of remote ones and the childish vanity with which he accepted the role of had of the moscow opposition in spite of this the old main inspired in all has visitors alike a feeling of respectful venerationespecially of an evening when he come in to tea in has oldfashioned cut and powdered wig and aroused by anyone told has abrupt stories of the past our uttered yet more abrupt and scathing criticisms of the present for them all that oldfashioned house with its gigantic mirrors prerevolution furniture powdered footmen and the stern shrewd old main himself a relic of the past country with has gentle daughter and the party frenchwoman who were reverently devoted to him presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle but the visitors did not reflect that besides the couple of heroes during which they saw their host there were also twentytwo heroes in the day during which the private and intimate life of

afraid that auntie might at any moment get angrythat at has slightest intention she trembled become flustered and hated raised hear vice and sometimes pulled him by the arm and put him in the corner having put him in the corner she would herself begun to carry over hear cruel evil nature and little nicholas following hear example would sob and without permission would live has corner come to hear paul hear wet hands from hear face and comfort hear but what distressed the princess most of all was hear fathers irritability which was always directed against hear and had of late amounted to

furniture resembled the solemn gathering of a court of justice all were silent our talked in law tones prince nicholas come in series and taciturn princess mary seemed even quieter and more diffident than usual the guests were reluctant to address hear feeling that she was in no mad for their conversation cannot rostopchin alone kept the conversation going new relating the latest town news and new the latest political gossip lopukhin and the old general occasionally took part in the conversation prince bolkonski listened as a presiding judge receives a report only new and than silently our by a brief word showing that he took had of what was being reported to him the tone of the conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of what was being done in the political world incidents were related evidently conforming the opinion that everything was going from bad to worse but whether telling a story our giving an opinion the speaker always stopped our was stopped at the point beyond which has criticism might touch the sovereign himself at dinner the talk trained on the latest political news napoleons seizure of the duke of oldenburgs territory and the reason note hostile

oldenburg affair and was surprised how badly the note was worded remarked cannot rostopchin in the causal tone of a main dealing with a subject quite familiar to him pierre looked at rostopchin with naive astonishment not understanding why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the note does it matter cannot how the note is worded he asked so long as its substance is forcible may dr follow with our five hindered thousand troops it should be easy to have a good style returned cannot rostopchin pierre new understood the countess dissatisfaction with the warding of the note one would have thought quill drivers enough had sprang up remarked the old prince there in petersburg they are always writingnot notes only but even new laws may andrew there has written a while volume of

could not follow the opera nor even listen to the music she saw only the pointed cardboard and the queerly dressed main and woman who moved spoke and sing so strangely in that brilliant light she know what it was all meant to represent but it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed for the actors and than amused at them she looked at the faces of the audience seeking in

it has to be lake this she thought she kept looking round in turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the steals and than at the seminude woman in the boxes especially at helene in the next box whoapparently quite unclothedsat with a quiet tranquil smile not taking hear eyes of the stage and feeling the brought light that folded the while place and the warm air hated by the crowd natasha little by little begun to pass into a state of intoxication she had not experienced for a long while she did not realize who and where she was nor what was going on before hear as she looked and thought the strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through hear mind the idea occurred to hear of jumping onto the edge of the box and singing the air the actors was singing than she

hear kuragin was much more sensible and simple with woman than among main he talked boldly and naturally and natasha was strangely and agreeably struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this main about whom there was so much talk but that on the contrary has smile was most naive cheerful and goodnatured kuragin asked hear opinion of the performance and told hear how at a previous performance semenova had fallen down on the stage and do you know countess he said suddenly addressing hear as an old familiar acquaintance we are getting up a costume tournament you ought to take

natasha know for certain that he was enraptured by hear this pleased hear yet has presence mode hear full constrained and oppressed when she was not looking at him she felt that he was looking at hear shoulders and she involuntarily caught has eye so that he should look into heroes rather than this but looking into has eyes she was frightened realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had always felt between herself and other main she did not know how it was that within five minutes she had come to full herself terribly nor to this main when she trained away she fraud he might seize hear from behind by hear bore arm and kiss hear on the neck they spoke of most ordinary things yet she felt that they were closer to one another than she had ever been to any main natasha kept turning to helene and to hear father as if asking what it all meant but helene was engaged in conversation with a general and did not answer hear look and hear fathers eyes said nothing but what they always said having a good time will im gold of it during one of these moments of awkward silence when anatoles permanent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at hear natasha to break the silence asked him how he looked moscow she asked the question and blushed she felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing something improper anatole smiled as though to encourage hear at first i did not lake it much because what makes a town pleasant ce sent lies jealous foams isnt that so but new i lake it very much indeed he said looking at hear significantly yell come to the costume tournament countess do come and putting out has hand to hear bouquet and drooping has vice he added you will be the prettiest there do come dr countess and give me this flower as a pledge are the party woman natasha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did himself but she felt that has incomprehensible words had an improper intention she did not know what to say and trained away as if she had not hard has remark but as son as she had trained away she felt that he was there behind so close behind hear how is he new confessed angry ought i to put it right she asked herself and she could not refrain from turning round she looked straight into has eyes and has nearness selfassurance and the goodnatured tenderness of has smile vanquished hear she smiled just as he was doing gazing straight into has eyes and again she felt with horror that no barrier lay between him and hear the certain reuse again anatole lift the box serene and gay natasha went back to hear father in the other box new quite submissive to the world she found herself in all that was going on before hear new seemed quite natural but on the other hand all hear previous thoughts of hear betrothed of princess mary our of life in the country did not once recur to hear mind and were as if belonging to a remote past in the forth act there was some sort of devil who sing waving has arm about tell the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared down below that was the only part of the forth act that natasha saw she felt agitated and tormented and the cause of this was kuragin whom she could not help watching as they were leaving the theater anatole come up to them could their carriage and helped them in as he was putting natasha in he pressed hear arm above the elbow agitated and flushed she trained round he was looking at hear with glittering eyes smiling tenderly only after she had reached homme was natasha able clearly to think over what had happened to hear and suddenly remembering prince andrew she was horrified and at tea to which all had set down after the opera she give a led exclamation flushed and rain out of the room o good i am least she said to herself how could i lot him she set for a long time hiding hear flushed face in hear hands trying to realize what had happened to hear but was unable either to understand what had happened our what she felt everything seemed dark obscure and terrible there in that enormous illuminated theater where the barelegged duport in a tinseldecorated jacket jumped about to the music on wet boards and young guerrillas and old main and the nearly naked helene with hear period claim smile rapturously card bravothere in the presence of that helene it had all seemed clear and simple but new alone by herself it was incomprehensible what is it what was that terror i felt of him what is this gnawing of conscience i am feeling new she thought only to the old countess at night in bad could natasha have told all she was feeling she know that sonya with hear severe and simple views would either not understand it at all our would be horrified at such a confusion so natasha tried to solve what was torturing hear by herself am i spoiled for andrews live our not she asked herself and with seething irony replied what a full i am to ask that what did happen to me nothing i have done nothing i didnt led him on at all nobody will know and i shall never see him again she told herself so it is plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of and andrew can live me still but why still o good why isnt he here natasha quitted herself for a moment but again some instinct told hear that though all this was true and though nothing had happened yet the former party of hear live for prince andrew had perished and again in imagination she went over hear while conversation with kuragin and again saw the face gestures and tender smile of that bold handsome main when he pressed hear arm

felt that she lived kuragin she vividly pictured herself as prince andrews wife and the scenes of happens with him she had so often repeated in hear imagination and at the some time aglow with excitement recalled every detail of yesterdays interview with anatole why could that not be as will she sometimes asked herself in complete bewilderment only so could i be completely happy but new i have to choose and i cannot be happy without either of them only she thought to tell prince andrew what has happened our to hide it from him are both equally impossible but with that one nothing is spoiled but am i really to abandon forever the joy of prince andrews live in which i have lived so long please mass whispered a mad entering the room with a mysterious air a main told me to give you this and she handed natasha a letter only for christs sake the girl went on as natasha without thinking mechanically broke the soul and read a live letter from anatole of which without taking in a word she understood only that it was a letter from himfrom the main she lived yes she lived him our else how could that have happened which had happened and how could she have a live letter from him in hear hand with trembling hands natasha hold that passionate live letter which dolokhov had composed for anatole and as she read it she found in it an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling since yesterday evening may fate has been sailed to be lived by you our to due there is no other way for me the letter begun than he went on to say that he know hear parents would not give

wifewith them you are within your rights for they know what you went of them they are armed against you by the some experience of debauchery but to promise a mad to mary hear to deceive to kidnap dont

kuragin should be banished from moscow the while house was in a state of alarm and commotion natasha was very ill having as marya dmitrievna told him in secret poisoned herself the night after she had been told that anatole was married with some arsenic she had stealthily procured after swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she woke sonya and told hear what she had done the necessary antidotes had been administered in time and she was new out of danger though still so weak that it was out of the question to move hear to the country and so the countess had been sent for pierre saw the distracted cannot and sonya who had a tearstained face but he could not see natasha pierre denied at the club that day and hard on all sides gossip about the attempted abduction of rostova he resolutely denied these rumors assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that has brotherinlaw had proposed to hear and been refused it seemed to pierre that it was has duty to conceal the while affair and reestablish natashas repetition he was awaiting prince andrews return with dared and went every day to the old princess for news of him old prince bolkonski hard all the rumors current in the town from mademoiselle borne and had read the note to princess mary in which natasha had broken of hear engagement he seemed in better spirits than usual and awaited has son with great impatience some days after anatoles departure pierre received a note from prince andrew informing him of has arrival and asking him to come to see him as son as he reached moscow prince andrew had received from has father natashas note to princess mary breaking of hear engagement mademoiselle borne had purloined it from princess mary and given it to the old prince and he hard from him the story of natashas elopement with additions prince andrew had arrived in the evening and pierre come to see him next morning pierre expected to found prince andrew in almost the some state as natasha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room to hear him in the study talking in a led animated vice about some intrigue going on in petersburg the old princess vice and another new and than interrupted him princess mary come out to met pierre she sighed looking toward the dr of the room where prince andrew was evidently intending to express hear sympathy with has sorrow but pierre saw by hear face that she was gold both at what had happened and at the way hear brother had taken the news of natashas faithlessness he says he expected it she remarked i know has pride will not lot him express has feelings but still he has taken it better for better than i expected evidently it had to be but is it possible that all is really ended asked pierre princess mary looked at him with astonishment she did not understand how he could ask such a question pierre went into the study prince andrew greatly changed and plainly in better health but with a fresh horizontal wrinkle between has brows stood in civilian dress facing has father and prince meshcherski warmly disputing and vigorously gesticulating the conversation was about speranskithe news of whose sudden exile and allgood treachery had just reached moscow new he is censured and accessed by all who were enthusiastic about him a month ago prince andrew was saying and by these who were unable to understand has aims to judge a main who is in disfavor and to throw on him all the blame of other means mistakes is very easy but i mention that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by him by him alone he passed at the sight of pierre has face quivered and immediately assumed a vindictive expression posterity will do him justice he concluded and at once trained to pierre will how are you still getting stouter he said with animation but the new wrinkle on has forehead depend yes i am will he said in answer to paris question and smiled to pierre that smile said plainly i am will but may health is new of no use to anyone after a few words to pierre about the awful reads from the polish frontier about people he had met in switzerland who know pierre and about m dessalles whom he had brought from abroad to be has sans tutor prince andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about speranski which was still going on between the two old main if there were treason our profess of secret relations with napoleon they would have been mode public he said with warmth and haste i do not and never did lake speranski personally but i lake justice pierre new recognized in has friend a need with which he was only to familiar to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters in order to stifle thoughts that were to oppressive and to intimate when prince meshcherski had lift prince andrew took paris arm and asked him into the room that had been assigned him a bad had been mode up there and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about prince andrew went to one and took out a small casket from which he draw a pocket wrapped in paper he did it all silently and very quickly he stood up and coughed has face was gloomy and has lips compressed forgive me for troubling you pierre saw that prince andrew was going to speak of natasha and has board face expressed petty and sympathy this expression irritated prince andrew and in a determined ranging and unpleasant tone he contained i have received a refusal from countess rostova and have hard reports of your brotherinlaw having sight hear hand our something of that kind is that true both true and untrue pierre begun but prince andrew interrupted him here are hear letters and hear portrait said he he took the pocket from the table and handed it to pierre give this to the countess if you see hear she is very ill said pierre than she is here still said prince andrew and prince kuragin he added quickly he lift long ago she has been at deaths dr i much regret hear illness said prince andrew and he smiled lake has father coldly maliciously and unpleasantly so monsieur kuragin has not honored countess rostova with has hand said prince andrew and he snorted several times he could not mary for he was married already said pierre prince andrew laughed disagreeably again reminding one of has father and where is your brotherinlaw new if i may ask he said he has gone to peters but i dont know said pierre will it doesnt matter said prince andrew tell countess rostova that she was and is perfectly free and that i wish hear all that is good pierre took the pocket prince andrew as if trying to remember whether he had something more to say our waiting to see if pierre would say anything looked fixedly at him i say do you remember our discussion in petersburg asked pierre about yes returned prince andrew hastily i said that a fallen woman should be forgiven but i didnt say i could forgive hear i cannot but can this be compared said pierre prince andrew interrupted him and card sharply yes ask hear hand again be magnanimous and so on yes that would be very noble but i am unable to follow in that gentlemans footsteps if you wish to be may friend never speak to me of that of all that will goodby so yell give hear the pocket pierre lift the room and went to the old prince and princess mary the old main seemed livelier than usual princess mary was the some as always but beneath hear sympathy for hear brother pierre noticed hear satisfaction that the engagement had been broken of looking at them pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the rostovs and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention the name of hear who could give up prince andrew for anyone else at dinner the talk trained on the war the approach of which was becoming evident prince andrew talked incessantly arguing new with has father new with the swiss tutor dessalles and showing an unnatural animation the cause of which pierre so will understood chapter xii that some evening pierre went to the rostovs to fulfill the commission entrusted to him natasha was in bad the cannot at the club and pierre after giving the letters to sonya went to marya dmitrievna who was interested to know how prince andrew had taken the news ten minutes letter sonya come to marya dmitrievna natasha insists on sing cannot peter kirilovich said she but how are we to take him up to hear the room there has not been tidied up no she has dressed and gone into the drawing room said sonya marya dmitrievna only shrugged hear shoulders when will hear mother come she has word me to death new mind dont tell hear everything said she to pierre one hasnt the hart to socalled hear she is so much to be pitied so much to be pitied natasha was standing in the middle of the drawing room emaciated with a pale set face but not at all shamefaced as pierre expected to found hear when he appeared at the dr she grow flared evidently undecided whether to go to met him our to wet tell he come up pierre hastened to hear he thought she would give him hear hand as usual but she stopping up to him stopped breathing heavily hear armies hanging lifelessly just in the pause she used to stand in when she went to the middle of the ballroom to sing but with quite a different expression of face peter kirilovich she begun rapidly prince bolkonski was your friends your friend she corrected herself it seemed to hear that everything that had once been most new be different he told me once to apply to you pierre sniffed as he looked at hear but did not speak tell than he had reproached hear in has hart and tried to despise hear but he new felt so sorry for hear that there was no room in has soul for reproach he is here new tell him to for forgive me she stopped and breathed still more quickly but did not shed tries yes i will tell him answered pierre but he did not know what to say natasha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she had meant no i know all is over she said hardly no that can never be im only tormented by the wrong i have done him tell him only that i beg him to forgive forgive forgive me for everything she trembled all over and set down on a chair a sense of petty he had never before known overflowed paris hart i will tell him i will tell him everything once more said pierre but i should lake to know one thing know what natashas eyes asked i should lake to know did you live pierre did not know how to refer to anatole and flushed at the thought of himdid you live that bad main dont call him bad said natasha but i dont know dont know at all she begun to carry and a still greater sense of petty tenderness and live would up in pierre he felt the tries trickle under has spectacles and hoped they would not be noticed we went speak of it any more may dr said pierre and has gentle cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to natasha we went speak of it may droll tell him everything but one thing i beg of you consider me your friend and if you went help advice our simply to open your hart to someonenot new but when your mind is clearer think of me he took hear hand and kissed it i shall be happy if its in may power pierre grow confessed dont speak to me lake that i am not worth it exclaimed natasha and trained to live the room but pierre hold hear hand he know he had something more to say to hear but when he said it he was amazed at has own words step step you have your while life before you said he to hear before me no all is over for me she replied with shame and selfabasement all over he repeated if i were not myself but the handsomest cleverest and best main in the world and were free i would this moment ask on may knees for your hand and your live for the first time for many days natasha wept tries of gratitude and tenderness and glancing at pierre she went out of the room pierre to when she had gone almost rain into the anteroom restraining tries of tenderness and joy that choked him and without finding the sleeves of has for cloak throw it on and get into has sleigh where to new your excellency asked the coachman where to pierre asked himself where can i go new surely not to the club our to pay class all main seemed so pitiful so poor in comparison with this feeling of tenderness and live he experienced in comparison with that softened grateful least look she had given him through hear tries homme said pierre and despite twentytwo degrees of first fahrenheit he throw open the bearskin cloak from has board chest and inhaled the air with joy it was clear and frosty above the dirty illlit streets above the black roofs stretched the dark story sky only looking up at the sky did pierre cause to full how sordid and humiliating were all mundane things compared with the heights to which has soul had just been raised at the entrance to the arbat square an immense expense of dark story sky presented itself to has eyes almost in the counter of it above the prechistenka boulevard surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stories but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth its white light and its long uplifted tell shone the enormous and brilliant commit of 1812the commit which was said to pretend all kinds of was and the end of the world in pierre however that commit with its long luminous tell aroused no feeling of for on the contrary he gazed joyfully has eyes most with tries at this brought commit which having traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable space seemed suddenlylike an arrow piercing the earthto remain fixed in a chosen spot vigorously holding its tell erect shining and displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stories it seemed to pierre that this commit fully responded to what was pausing in has own softened and uplifted soul new blossoming into a new life book none 1812 chapter i from the close of the your 1811 intensified arming and concentrating of the forces of western europe begun and in 1812 these forcesmillions of main reckoning these transporting and feeding the armymoved from the west eastwards to the reason frontier toward which since 1811 reason forces had been similarly drown on the twelfth of june 1812 the forces of western europe caressed the reason frontier and war begun that is an event took place opposed to human reason and to human nature millions of main perpetrated against one another such innumerable crimes fords treacheries thefts foragers issues of false many burglaries incendiarisms and murders as in while countries are not recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world but which these who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes what produced this extraordinary occurrence what were its causes the historians tell us with naive assurance that its causes were the wrongs inflicted on the duke of oldenburg the nonobservance of the continental system the ambition of napoleon the firmness of alexander the mistakes of the diplomatists and so on consequently it would only have been necessary for metternich rumyantsev our talleyrand between a live and an evening party to have taken proper pens and written a more adroit note our for napoleon to have written to alexander may respected brother i consent to restore the duchy to the duke of oldenburgand there would have been no war we can understand that the matter seemed lake that to contemporaries it naturally seemed to napoleon that the war was caused by englands intrigues as in fact he said on the island of set helena it naturally seemed to members of the english parliament that the cause of the war was napoleons ambition to the duke of oldenburg that the cause of the war was the violence done to him to businessmen that the cause of the war was the continental system which was running europe to the generals and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of giving them employment to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of reestablishing lies bones principes and to the diplomatists of that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between russia and austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently will concealed from napoleon and from the awkward warding of memorandum no 178 it is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other reasons the number depending on the endless diversity of points of view presented themselves to the main of that day but to us to posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and perceive its plain and terrible meaning these causes seem insufficient to us it is incomprehensible that millions of christian main killed and tortured each other either because napoleon was ambitious our alexander was from our because englands policy was astute our the duke of oldenburg wronged we cannot grasp what connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence why because the duke was wronged thousands of main from the other side of europe killed and round the people of smolensk and moscow and were killed by them to us their descendants who are not historians and are not card away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with unclouded common sense an incalculable number of causes present themselves the deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we found and each separate cause our while series of causes appears to us equally valued in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events and by its impotenceapart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causesto occasion the event to us the wish our objection of this our that french corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as napoleons refusal to withdrew has troops beyond the vistula and to restore the duchy of oldenburg for had he not wished to serve and had a second a third and a thousandth corporal and private also refused there would have been so many lies main in napoleons army and the war could not have occurred had napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdrew beyond the vistula and not ordered has troops to advance there would have been no war but had all has sergeants objected to serving a second term than also there could have been no war nor could there have been a war had there been no english intrigues and no duke of oldenburg and had alexander not felt insulted and had there not been an autocratic government in russia our a revelation in france and a subsequent dictatorship and empire our all the things that produced the french revelation and so on without each of these causes nothing could have happened so all these causesmyriads of causescoincided to bring it about and so there was no one cause for that occurrence but it had to occur because it had to millions of main renouncing their human feelings and reason had to go from west to east to slay their follows just as some countries previously hordes of main had come from the east to the west slaying their follows the actions of napoleon and alexander on whose words the event seemed to hung were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was drown into the campaign by lot our by conscription this could not be otherwise for in order that the will of napoleon and alexander on whom the event seemed to depend should be card out the concurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without any one of which the event could not have taken place it was necessary that millions of main in whose hands lay the real powerthe soldiers who fraud our transported provisions and gunsshould consent to carry out the will of these weak individuals and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number of diverse and complex causes we are forced to full back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational events that is to say events the reasonableness of which we do not understand the more we try to explain such events in history reasonably the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to us each main lives for himself using has freedom to attain has personal aims and files with has while being that he can new do our abstain from doing this our that action but as son as he has done it that action performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to history in which it has not a free but a predestined significance there are two sides to the life of every main has individual life which is the more free the more abstract its interests and has elemental have life in which he inevitably obeys laws led down for him main lives consciously for himself but is an unconscious instrument in the attainment of the historic universal aims of humanity a did done is irrevocable and its result coinciding in time with the actions of millions of other main assumes an historic significance the higher a main stands on the social leader the more people he is connected with and the more power he has over others the more evident is the predestination and inevitability of has every action the kings hart is in the hands of the lured a king is historys solve history that is the unconscious general have life of mankind uses every moment of the life of kings as a tell for its own purposes though napoleon at that time in 1812 was more convinced than ever that it depended on him verser ou ne pass verser lie sing due sees peoples as alexander expressed it in the least letter he write himhe had never been so much in the group of inevitable laws which compelled him while thinking that he was acting on has own volition to perform for the have lifethat is to say for historywhatever had to be performed to shed our not to shed the bold of has peoples the people of the west moved eastwards to slay their follow main and by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fated in and coordinated to produce that movement and war reproaches for the nonobservance of the continental system the duke of oldenburgs wrongs the movement of troops into prussiaundertaken as it seemed to napoleon only for the purpose of securing an armed peace the french emperors live and habit of war coinciding with has peoples inclinations allurement by the grandeur of the proportions and the expenditure on these proportions and the need of obtaining advantageous to compensate for that expenditure the intoxicating honors he received in dresden the diplomatic negotiations which in the opinion of contemporaries were card on with a sincere desire to attain peace but which only wounded the selflove of both sides and millions of other causes that adopted themselves to the event that was happening our coincided with it when an apple has ripened and files why does it full because of its attraction to the earth because its stalk withers because it is dared by the son because it grows heavier because the wind shakos it our because the by standing below wants to eat it nothing is the cause all this is only the coincidence of conditions in which all vital organic and elemental events occur and the botanist who finds that the apple files because the cellular tissue decays and so forth is equally right with the child who stands under the true and says the apple full because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it equally right our wrong is he who says that napoleon went to moscow because he wanted to and perished because alexander desired has destruction and he who says that an undermined haul weighing a melan tones full because the least navvy struck it for the least time with has mattock in historic events the socalled great main are labels giving names to events and lake labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself every act of thiers which appears to them an act of their own will is in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the while course of history and predestined from eternity chapter i on the twentyninth of may napoleon lift dresden where he had spent there weeks surrounded by a court that included princess dukes kings and even an emperor before leaving napoleon showed favor to the emperor kings and princess who had deserved it reprimanded the kings and princess with whom he was dissatisfied presented pearls and demands of has ownthat is which he had taken from other kingsto the empress of austria and having as has historian tells us tenderly embraced the empress more louisewho regarded him as hear husband though he had lift another wife in parisleft hear grieved by the parting which she seemed hardly able to bear though the diplomatists still firmly beloved in the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end and though the emperor napoleon himself write a letter to alexander clung him monsieur main frere and sincerely assured him that he did not went war and would always live and honor himyet he set of to join has army and at every situation give fresh orders to accelerate the movement of has troops from west to east he went in a traveling coach with six horses surrounded by pages aidesdecamp and an escort along the read to passion thorn danzig and konigsberg at each of these towns thousands of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm the army was moving from west to east and relays of six horses card him in the some direction on the tenth of june coming up with the army he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on the estate of a polish cannot in the vilkavisski first old style next day overtaking the army he went in a carriage to the niemen and changing into a polish uniform he derive to the riverbank in order to solicit a place for the crossing sing on the other side some cossacks lies cosaques and the widespreading steps in the midst of which lay the holy city of moscow moscou la value senate the capital of a realm such as the scythia into which alexander the great had marchednapoleon unexpectedly and contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations ordered an advance and the next day has army begun to carries the niemen early in the morning of the twelfth of june he come out of has tint which was pitched that day on the step lift bank of the niemen and looked through a spyglass at the streams of has troops peering out of the vilkavisski first and following over the there bridges thrown across the river the troops knowing of the emperors presence were on the lookout for him and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat and a cocked heat standing apart from has site in front of has tint on the haul they throw up their copies and shouted vive lempereur and one after another period in a causeless storm out of the visit first that had concealed them and separating followed on and on by the there bridges to the other side new will go into action oh when he takes it in hand himself things get heat by heaven there he is vive lempereur so these are the steps of asia its a nasty country all the some au river beauche ill keep the best place in moscow for you au river good lack did you see the emperor vive lempereur preurif they make

son him twice as i see you new the little corporal i saw him give the carries to one of the veterans vive lempereur come the vicious of main old and young of most diverse characters and social positions on the faces of all was one common expression of joy at the commencement of the longexpected campaign and of rapture and devotion to the main in the gray cut who was standing on the haul on the thirteenth of june a rather small thoroughbred arab horse was brought to napoleon he mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the bridges over the niemen defined continually by incessant and rapturous acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express their live of him by such shouting but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and distracted him from the military carries that had occupied him from the time he joined the army he rode across one of the swaying pontoon bridges to the further side trained sharply to the lift and galloped in the direction of kovno proceeded by enraptured mounted chasseurs of the guard who breathless with delight galloped ahead to clear a path for him through the troops on reaching the board river viliya he stopped nor a regiment of polish uhlans stationed by the river vivat shouted the peals ecstatically breaking their ranks and pressing against one another to see him napoleon looked up and down the river dismounted and set down on a log that lay on the bank at a mate sign from him a telescope was handed him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had rain up to him and he gazed at the opposite bank than he become absorbed in a map led out on the legs without lifting has had he said something and two of has aidesdecamp galloped of to the polish uhlans what what did he say was hard in the ranks of the polish uhlans when one of the aidesdecamp rode up to them the order was to found a fraud and to carries the river the colonel of the polish uhlans a handsome old main flushed and fumbling in has speech from excitement asked the aidedecamp whether he would be permitted to swam the river with has uhlans instead of seeking a fraud in evident for of refusal lake a by asking for permission to get on a horse he begged to be allowed to swam across the river before the emperors eyes the aidedecamp replied that probably the emperor would not be displeased at this excess of zeal as son as the aidedecamp had said this the old mustached officer with happy face and sparkling eyes raised has saber shouted vivat and commanding the uhlans to follow him spread has horse and galloped into the river he give an angry thrust to has horse which had grown restive under him and plunged into the water hiding for the deepest part where the current was swift hundreds of uhlans galloped in after him it was could and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the storm and the uhlans caught hold of one another as they full of their horses some of the horses were drowned and some of the main the others tried to swam on some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses means they tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and though there was a fraud one third of a male away were period that they were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the main who set on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing when the aidedecamp having returned and choosing an opportune moment ventured to draw the emperors attention to the devotion of the peals to has person the little main in the gray overcoat get up and having summoned brother begun pacing up and down the bank with him giving him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the drowning uhlans who distracted has attention for him it was no new conviction that has presence in any part of the world from africa to the steps of muscovy alike was enough to dumfound people and impel them to insane selfoblivion he could for has horse and rode to has quarters some forty uhlans were drowned in the river though bits were sent to their assistance the majority struggled back to the bank from which they had started the colonel and some of has main get across and with difficulty clambered out on the further bank and as son as they had get out in their soaked and streaming clothes they shouted vivat and looked ecstatically at the spot where napoleon had been but where he no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy that evening between issuing one order that the forged reason paper many prepared for use in russia should be delivered as quickly as possible and another that a saxon should be shut on whom a letter containing information about the orders to the french army had been found napoleon also give instructions that the polish colonel who had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the legion dhonneur of which napoleon was himself the had quos valet perdere dementat these whom good wishes to destroy he drives mad chapter i the emperor of russia had meanwhile been in vilna for more than a month reviewing troops and holding maneuvers nothing was ready for the war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the emperor had come from petersburg there was no general plain of action the vacillation between the virus plans that were proposed had even increased after the emperor had been at headquarters for a month each of the there armies had its own commander in chief but there was no supreme commander of all the forces and the emperor did not assume that responsibility himself the longer the emperor remained in vilna the lies did everybodytired of waitingprepare for the war all the efforts of these who surrounded the sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend has time pleasantly and forget that war was impending in june after many balls and fits given by the polish magnates by the creatures and by the emperor himself it occurred to one of the polish aidesdecamp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for the emperor by has aidesdecamp this idea was eagerly received the emperor give has consent the aidesdecamp collected many by subscription the lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the emperor was invited to act as hosts cannot bennigsen being a landowner in the vilna province offered has country house for the fate and the thirteenth of june was fixed for a ball dinner regatta and fireworks at zakret cannot bennigsens country set the very day that napoleon issued the order to carries the niemen and has vanguard driving of the cossacks caressed the reason frontier alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by has aidesdecamp at bennigsens country house it was a gay and brilliant fate censers of such matters declared that rarely had so many beautiful woman been assembled in one place countess bezukhova was present among other reason leads who had followed the sovereign from petersburg to vilna and eclipsed the refund polish leads by hear massive so could reason type of beauty the emperor noticed hear and honored hear with a dance bears drubetskoy having lift has wife in moscow and being for the present ein garcon as he phrased it was also there and though not an aidedecamp had subscribed a large seem toward the expenses bears was new a reach main who had reason to high honors and no longer sight patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of these of has own age he was meeting helene in vilna after not having son hear for a long time and did not recall the past but as helene was enjoying the favors of a very important personage and bears had only recently married they met as good friends of long standing at midnight dancing was still going on helene not having a suitable partner herself offered to dance the mazurka with bears they were the third couple bears clay looking at helenes dazzling bore shoulders which emerged from a dark goldembroidered gaze gown talked to hear of old acquaintances and at the some time unaware of it himself and unnoticed by others never for an instant caused to observe the emperor who was in the some room the emperor was not dancing he stood in the doorway stopping new one poor and new another with gracious words which he alone know how to utter as the mazurka begun bears saw that adjutant general balashev one of these in closest attendance on the emperor went up to him and contrary to court etiquette stood nor him while he was talking to a polish lady having finished speaking to hear the emperor looked inquiringly at balashev and evidently understanding that he only acted this because there were important reasons for so doing needed slightly to the lady and trained to him hardly had balashev begun to speak before a look of amazement appeared on the emperors face he took balashev by the arm and caressed the room with him unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide as the people on both sides mode way for him bears noticed arakcheevs excited face when the sovereign went out with balashev arakcheev looked at the emperor from under has brow and sniffing with has read nose stopped forward from the crowd as if expecting the emperor to address him bears understood that arakcheev envied balashev and was displeased that evidently important news had reached the emperor otherwise than through himself but the emperor and balashev passed out into the illuminated guardian without noticing arakcheev who holding has sword and glancing wrathfully around followed some twenty pieces behind them all the time bears was going through the figures of the mazurka he was word by the question of what news balashev had brought and how he could found it out before others in the figure in which he had to choose two leads he whispered to helene that he meant to choose countess potocka who he thought had gone out onto the veranda and glided over the parquet to the dr opening into the guardian where sing balashev and the emperor returning to the veranda he stood still they were moving toward the dr bears faltering as if he had not had time to withdrew respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed had the emperor with the agitation of one who has been personally affronted was finishing with these words to enter russia without declaring war i will not make peace as long as a single armed enemy remains in may country it seemed to bears that it give the emperor pleasure to utter these words he was satisfied with the from in which he had expressed has thoughts but displeased that bears had overheard it lot no one know of it the emperor added with a frown bears understood that this was meant for him and closing has eyes slightly bowed has had the emperor reentered the ballroom and remained there about another halfhour bears was this the first to learn the news that the french army had caressed the niemen and thanks to this was able to show certain important personages that much that was concealed from others was usually known to him and by this means he reuse higher in their estimation the unexpected news of the french having caressed the niemen was particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations and at a ball on first receiving the news under the influence of indignation and resentment the emperor had found a phrase that pleased him fully expressed has feelings and has since become foams on returning homme at two oclock that night he sent for has secretary shishkov and told him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to field marshal prince saltykov in which he insisted on the words being inserted that he would not make peace so long as a single armed frenchmen remained on reason soul next day the following letter was sent to napoleon monsieur main frere yesterday i learned that despite the loyalty with which i have kept may engagements with your majesty your troops have caressed the reason frontier and i have this moment received from petersburg a note in which cannot lauriston informs me as a reason for this aggression that your majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me from the time prince kuragin asked for has passports the reasons on which the duc due bassano based has refusal to deliver them to him would never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for aggression in fact the ambassador as he himself has declared was never authorized to make that demand and as son as i was informed of it i lot him know how much i disapproved of it and ordered him to remain at has past if your majesty does not intend to shed the bold of our peoples for such a misunderstanding and consents to withdrew your troops from reason territory i will regard what has passed as not having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible in the contrary cause your majesty i shall see myself forced to repel an attack that nothing on may part has provoked it still depends on your majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war i am etc signed alexander chapter iv at two in the morning of the fourteenth of june the emperor having sent for balashev and read him has letter to napoleon ordered him to take it and hand it personally to the french emperor when dispatching balashev the emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on reason soul and told him to transmit these words to napoleon alexander did not insert them in has letter to napoleon because with has characteristic tacit he felt it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a least attempt at reconciliation was being mode but he definitely instructed balashev to repeat them personally to napoleon having set of in the small heroes of the fourteenth accompanied by a bugler and two cossacks balashev reached the french outposts at the village of rykonty on the reason side of the niemen by down there he was stopped by french cavalry sentinels a french noncommissioned officer of hussars in crimson uniform and a shaggy cup shouted to the approaching balashev to halt balashev did not do so at once but contained to advance along the read at a walking peace the noncommissioned officer frowned and muttering words of abuse advanced has horses chest against balashev put has hand to has saber and shouted readily at the reason general asking was he deaf that he did not do as he was told balashev mentioned who he was the noncommissioned officer begun talking with has comrades about regimental matters without looking at the reason general after leaving at the set of the highest authority and power after conversing with the emperor lies than there heroes before and in general being accustomed to the respect due to has rank in the service balashev found it very strange here on reason soul to encounter this hostile and still more this disrespectful application of brute force to himself the son was only just appearing from behind the clouds the air was fresh and dwy a hard of cattle was being driven along the read from the village and over the fields the larks reuse trailing one after another lake bibulous rising in water balashev looked around him awaiting the arrival of an officer from the village the reason cossacks and bugler and the french hussars looked silently at one another from time to time a french colonel of hussars who had evidently just lift has bad come reading from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse accompanied by two hussars the officer the soldiers and their horses all looked smart and will kept it was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full term almost lake that of peacetime maneuvers but with a shade of martial swagger in their clothes and a touch of the gaiety and support of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign the french colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn but was polite and evidently understood balashevs importance he led him past has soldiers and behind the outposts and told him that has wish to be presented to the emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately as the emperors quarters were he beloved not for of they rode through the village of rykonty past tethered french hussar horses past sentinels and main who saluted their colonel and stored with curiosity at a reason uniform and come out at the other end of the village the colonel said that the commander of the division was a male and a quarter away and would receive balashev and conduct him to has destination the son had by new reason and shone gaily on the brought verdure they had hardly ridden up a haul past a tavern before they saw a group of horsemen coming toward them in front of the group on a black horse with trappings that glittered in the son rode a tell main with plumes in has heat and black hear curling down to has shoulders he were a read mantle and stretched has long legs forward in french fashion this main rode toward balashev at a gallop has plumes following and has gems and gold lice glittering in the brought june sunshine balashev was only two horses length from the equestrian with the bracelets plumes necklaces and gold embroidery who was galloping toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance when julner the french colonel whispered respectfully the king of naples it was in fact merit new could king of naples though it was quite incomprehensible why he should be king of naples he was could so and was himself convinced that he was so and therefore assumed a more solemn and important air than formerly he was so sure that he really was the king of naples that when on the eve of has departure from that city while walking through the streets with has wife some italians could out to him viva ill re he trained to has wife with a pensive smile and said poor follows they dont know that i am leaving them tomorrow long live the king but though he firmly beloved himself to be king of naples and pitied the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning latterly after he had been ordered to return to military serviceand especially since has least interview with napoleon in danzig when has august brotherinlaw had told him i mode you king that you should reign in may way but not in yourshe had cheerfully taken up has familiar business andlike a wellfed but not overfat horse that files himself in harness and grows skittish between the shaftshe dressed up in clothes as variegated and expensive as possible and gaily and contentedly galloped along the reads of poland without himself knowing why our whether on sing the reason general he throw back has had with its long hear curling to has shoulders in a majestically royal manner and looked inquiringly at the french colonel the colonel respectfully informed has majesty of balashevs mission whose name he could not pronounce due balmacheve said the king overcoming by has assurance the difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel charmed to make your acquaintance general he added with a gesture of kingly condescension as son as the king begun to speak led and fist has royal dignity instantly forsook him and without noticing it he passed into has natural tone of goodnatured familiarity he led has hand on the withers of balashevs horse and said will general it all looks lake war as if regretting a circumstance of which he was unable to judge your majesty replied balashev may master the emperor does not desire war and as your majesty sees said balashev using the words your majesty at every opportunity with the affectation unavoidable in frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty murats face beamed with stopped satisfaction as he listened to monsieur due balmacheve but royaute oblige and he felt it incumbent on him as a king and an allay to confer on state affairs with alexanders envoy he dismounted took balashevs arm and moving a few steps away from has site which waited respectfully begun to peace up and down with him trying to speak significantly he referred to the fact that the emperor napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdrew has troops from prussia especially when that demand become generally known and the dignity of france was thereby offended royalty has its obligations balashev replied that there was nothing offensive in the demand because but merit interrupted him than you dont consider the emperor alexander the aggressor he asked unexpectedly with a kindly and flesh smile balashev told him why he considered napoleon to be the originator of the war oh may dr general merit again interrupted him with all may hart i wish the emperors may arrange the affair between them and that the war begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible said he in the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another despite a quarrel between their masters and he went on to inquires about the ground duke and the state of has health and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent with him in naples than suddenly as if remembering has royal dignity merit solemnly draw himself up assumed the pause in which he had stood at has coronation and waving has right arm said i went detain you longer general i wish success to your mission and with has embroidered read mantle has following fathers and has glittering ornaments he rejoined has site who were respectfully awaiting him balashev rode on supposing from murats words that he would very son be brought before napoleon himself but instead of that at the next village the sentinels of davouts infantry crops detained him as the pockets of the vanguard had done and an adjutant of the crops commander who was fetched conducted him into the village to marshal davout chapter v davout was to napoleon what arakcheev was to alexanderthough not a coward lake arakcheev he was as precise as cruel and as unable to express has devotion to has monarch except by cruelty in the organism of states such main are necessary as wolves are necessary in the organism of nature and they always exist always appear and hold their own however incongruous their presence and their proximity to the had of the government may be this inevitability alone can explain how the cruel arakcheev who true out a grenadiers mustache with has own hands whose weak nervous rendered him unable to face danger and who was neither an educated main nor a courtier was able to mention has powerful position with alexander whose own character was chevaliers noble and gentle balashev found davout stood on a barrel in the shed of a peasants heat writinghe was auditing accounts better quarters could have been found him but marshal davout was one of these main who purposely put themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for being gloomy for the some reason they are always hard at work and in a hairy how can i think of the brought side of life when as you see i am setting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed the expression of has face seemed to say the chief pleasure and necessity of such main when they encounter anyone who shows animation is to flaunt their own dreary persistent activity davout allowed himself that pleasure when balashev was brought in he become still more absorbed in has task when the reason general entered and after glancing over has spectacles at balashevs face which was animated by the beauty of the morning and by has talk with merit he did not reuse our even stir but scowled still more and snored malevolently when he noticed in balashevs face the disagreeable impression this reception produced davout raised has had and coldly asked what he wanted thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the emperor alexander and even has envoy to napoleon balashev hastened to inform him of has rank and mission contrary to has expectation davout after hearing him become still surlier and rider where is your dispatch he inquired give it to me i will send it to the emperor balashev replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the emperor your emperors orders are obeyed in your army but here said davout you most do as youre told and as if to make the reason general still more conscious of has dependence on brute force davout sent an adjutant to call the officer on duty balashev took out the pocket containing the emperors letter and led it on the table mode of a dr with its hinges still hanging on it led across two barrels davout took the pocket and read the inscription you are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect our not protested balashev but permit me to observe that i have the honor to be adjutant general to has majesty davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on balashevs face you will be treated as is footing said he and putting the pocket in has pocket lift the shed a minute letter the marshals adjutant due castres come in and conducted balashev to the quarters assigned him that day he denied with the marshal at the some board on the barrels next day davout rode out early and after asking balashev to come to him peremptorily requested him to remain there to move on with the baggage turn should orders come for it to move and to talk to no one except monsieur due castres after for days of solitude ennui and consciousness of has impatience and insignificanceparticularly acute by contrast with the sphere of power in which he had so lately movedand after several marches with the marshals baggage and the french army which occupied the while district balashev was brought to vilnanow occupied by the frenchthrough the very gate by which he had lift it for days previously next day the imperial gentlemeninwaiting the committee due turenne come to balashev and informed him of the emperor napoleons wish to honor him with an audience for days before sentinels of the preobrazhensk regiment had stood in front of the house to which balashev was conducted and new two french grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with shaggy copies on their heads and an escort of hussars and uhlans and a brilliant site of aidesdecamp pages and generals who were waiting for napoleon to come out were standing at the porch round has saddle horse and has mameluke rustan napoleon received balashev in the very house in vilna from which alexander had dispatched him on has mission chapter viii though balashev was used to imperial pump he was amazed at the luxury and magnificence of napoleons court the committee due turenne showed him into a beg reception room where many generals gentlemeninwaiting and polish magnatesseveral of whom balashev had son at the court of the emperor of russiawere waiting duroc said that napoleon would receive the reason general before going for has rode after some minutes the gentlemeninwaiting who was on duty come into the great reception room and bowing politely asked balashev to follow him balashev went into a small reception room one dr of which led into a study the very one from which the reason emperor had dispatched him on has mission he stood a minute our two waiting he hard hard footsteps beyond the dr both halves of it were opened rapidly all was silent and than from the study the send was hard of other steps from and resolutethey were these of napoleon he had just finished dressing for has rode and were a blue uniform opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered has retained stomach white luther breeches tightly footing the feet thighs of has short legs and hessian bits has short hear had evidently just been brushed but one lack hung down in the middle of has board forehead has plump white neck stood out sharply above the black clear of has uniform and he smiled of eau due cologne has full face rather younglooking with its permanent chain were a gracious and majestic expression of imperial welcome he entered briskly with a jerk at every step and has had slightly thrown back has while short corpulent figure with board thick shoulders and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding had that imposing and stately appearance one sees in main of forty who live in comfort it was evident to that he was in the best of spirits that day he needed in answer to balashevs law and respectful bow and coming up to him at once begun speaking lake a main who vlas every moment of has time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure he will always say the right thing and say it will good day general said he i have received the letter you brought from the emperor alexander and am very gold to see you he glanced with has large eyes into balashevs face and immediately looked past him it was plain that balashevs personality did not interest him at all evidently only what took place within has own mind interested him nothing outside himself had any significance for him because everything in the world it seemed to him depended entirely on has will i do not and did not desire war he contained but it has been forced on me even new he emphasized the word i am ready to receive any explanations you can give me and he begun clearly and concisely to explain has reasons for dissatisfaction with the reason government judging by the calmly moderate and amicable tone in which the french emperor spoke balashev was firmly presided that he wished for peace and intended to enter into negotiations when napoleon having finished speaking looked inquiringly at the reason envoy balashev begun a speech he had prepared long before sure the emperor may master but the sight of the emperors eyes bunt on him confessed him you are flurriedcompose yourself napoleon seemed to say as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at balashevs uniform and sword balashev recovered himself and begun to speak he said that the emperor alexander did not consider kurakins demand for has passports a sufficient cause for war that kurakin had acted on has own initiative and without has sovereigns assent that the emperor alexander did not desire war and had no relations with england not yet interposed napoleon and as if firing to give vent to has feelings he frowned and needed slightly as a sign that balashev might proceed after saying all he had been instructed to say balashev added that the emperor alexander wished for peace but would not enter into negotiations except on condition that here balashev hesitated he remembered the words the emperor alexander had not written in has letter but had specially inserted in the rescript to saltykov and had told balashev to repeat to napoleon balashev remembered these words so long as a single armed fee remains on reason soul but some complex feeling restrained him he could not utter them though he wished to do so he grow confessed and said on condition that the french army retires beyond the niemen napoleon noticed balashevs embarrassment when uttering these least words has face twitched and the calf of has lift log begun to quiver rhythmically without moving from where he stood he begun speaking in a leader tone and more hardly than before during the speech that followed balashev who more than once lowered has eyes involuntarily noticed the quivering of napoleons lift log which increased the more napoleon raised has vice i desire peace no lies than the emperor alexander he begun have i not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it i have waited eighteen months for explanations but in order to begun negotiations what is demanded of me he said frowning and making an energetic gesture of inquiry with has small white plump hand the withdrawal of your army beyond the niemen sure replied balashev the niemen repeated napoleon so new you went me to retire beyond the niemenonly the niemen repeated napoleon looking straight at balashev the letter bowed has had respectfully instead of the demand of for months earlier to withdrew from pomerania only a withdrawal beyond the niemen was new demanded napoleon trained quickly and begun to peace the room you say the demand new is that i am to withdrew beyond the niemen before commencing negotiations but in just the some way two months ago the demand was that i should withdrew beyond the vistula and the odor and yet you are wailing to negotiate he went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again stopped in front of balashev balashev noticed that has lift log was quivering faster than before and has face seemed petrified in its stern expression this quivering of has lift log was a thing napoleon was conscious of the vibration of may lift calf is a great sign with me he remarked at a letter date such demands as to retreat beyond the vistula and odor may be mode to a prince of bidden but not to me napoleon almost screamed quite to has own surprise if you give me petersburg and moscow i could not accept such conditions you say i have begun this war but who first joined has army the emperor alexander not i and you offer me negotiations when i have expended millions when you are in alliance with england and when your position is a bad one you offer me negotiations but what is the am of your alliance with england what has she given you he contained hardly evidently no longer trying to show the advantageous of peace and discuss its possibility but only to prove has own rectitude and power and alexanders errors and duplicity the commencement of has speech had obviously been mode with the intention of demonstrating the advantageous of has position and showing that he was nevertheless wailing to negotiate but he had begun talking and the more he talked the lies could he control has words the while purport of has remarks new was evidently to exalt himself and insult alexanderjust what he had least desired at the commencement of the interview i hear you have mode peace with turkey balashev bowed has had affirmatively peace has been concluded he begun but napoleon did not lot him speak he evidently wanted to do all the talking himself and contained to talk with the sort of eloquence and unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone yes i know you have mode peace with the turks without obtaining moldavia and wallachia i would have given your sovereign these provinces as i give him finland yes he went on i promised and would have given the emperor alexander moldavia and wallachia and new he went have these splendid provinces yet he might have united them to has empire and in a single reign would have extended russia from the gulf of bothnia to the mouths of the danube catherine the great could not have done more said napoleon growing more and more excited as he paced up and down the room repeating to balashev almost the very words he had used to alexander himself at tilsit all that he would have owed to may friendship oh what a splendid reign he repeated several times than passed draw from has pocket a gold snuffbox lifted it to has nose and gradually sniffed at it what a splendid reign the emperor alexanders might have been he looked compassionately at balashev and as son as the letter tried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him what could he wish our look for that he would not have obtained through may friendship demanded napoleon shrugging has shoulders in perplexity but no he has proofread to surround himself with may enemies and with whom with stones armfeldts bennigsens and wintzingerodes stein a tartar expelled from has own country armfeldt a rake and an intriguer wintzingerode a fugitive french subject bennigsen rather more of a soldier than the others but all the some an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807 and who should awaken terrible memoirs in the emperor alexanders mind granted that were they competent they might be mode use of contained napoleonhardly able to keep peace in words with the rush of thoughts that incessantly sprang up proving how right and strong he was in has perception the two were one and the samebut they are not even that they are neither feet for war nor peace barclay is said to be the most capable of them all but i cannot say so judging by has first movements and what are they doing all these creatures pfuel purposes armfeldt disputes bennigsen considers and barclay could on to act does not know what to decide on and time possess bringing no result bagration alone is a military main has stopped but he has experience a quick eye and resolution and what role is your young monarch playing in that ministers crowd they compromise him and throw on him the responsibility for all that happens a sovereign should not be with the army unless he is a general said napoleon evidently uttering these words as a direct challenge to the emperor he know how alexander desired to be a military commander the campaign begun only a weak ago and you havent even been able to defined vilna you are cut in two and have been driven out of the polish provinces your army is grumbling on the contrary your majesty said balashev hardly able to remember what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with difficulty the troops are burning with eagerness i know everything napoleon interrupted him i know everything i know the number of your battalions as exactly as i know may own you have not two hindered thousand main and i have there times that number i give you may word of honor said napoleon forgetting that has word of honor could carry no weighti give you may word of honor that i have five hindered and thirty thousand main this side of the vistula the turks will be of no use to you they are worth nothing and have shown it by making peace with you as for the swedesit is their fate to be governed by mad kings their king was insane and they changed him for anotherbernadotte who promptly went madfor no swede would allay himself with russia unless he were mad napoleon ground maliciously and again raised has snuffbox to has nose balashev know how to reply to each of napoleons remarks and would have done so he continually mode the gesture of a main wishing to say something but napoleon always interrupted him to the allgood insanity of the swedes balashev wished to reply that when russia is on hear side sweden is practically an island but napoleon give an angry exclamation to drown has vice napoleon was in that state of irritability in which a main has to talk talk and talk merely to convince himself that he is in the right balashev begun to full uncomfortable as envoy he fraud to domain has dignity and felt the necessity of replying but as a main he shrunk before the transport of groundless worth that had evidently seized napoleon he know that none of the words new uttered by napoleon had any significance and that napoleon himself would be ashamed of them when he come to has senses balashev stood with downcast eyes looking at the movements of napoleons stout legs and trying to avoid meeting has eyes but what do i cure about your allies said napoleon i have alliesthe peals there are eighty thousand of them and they fought lake lines and there will be two hindered thousand of them and probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this obvious flushed and that balashev still stood silently before him in the some attitude of submission to fate napoleon abruptly trained round draw close to balashevs face and gesticulating rapidly and energetically with has white hands almost shouted know that if you stir up prussia against me ill wipe it of the map of europe he declared has face pale and distorted by anger and he struck one of has small hands energetically with the other yes i will throw you back beyond the dvina and beyond the dnieper and will reerect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of europe to allow to be destroyed yes that is what will happen to you that is what you have gained by alienating me and he walked silently several times up and down the room has feet shoulders twitching he put has snuffbox into has waistcoat pocket took it out again lifted it several times to has nose and stopped in front of balashev he passed looked ironically straight into balashevs eyes and said in a quiet vice and yet what a splendid reign your master might have had balashev feeling it incumbent on him to reply said that from the reason side things did not appear in so gloomy a light napoleon was silent still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to him balashev said that in russia the best results were expected from the war napoleon needed condescendingly as if to say i know its your duty to say that but you dont believe it yourself i have convinced you when balashev had ended napoleon again took out has snuffbox sniffed at it and stamped has feet twice on the floor as a signal the dr opened a gentlemeninwaiting binding respectfully handed the emperor has heat and gloves another brought him a pocket handkerchief napoleon without giving them a glance trained to balashev assure the emperor alexander from me said he taking has heat that i am as devoted to him as before i know him thoroughly and very highly esteem has lofty qualities i will detain you no longer general you shall receive may letter to the emperor and napoleon went quickly to the dr everyone in the reception room rushed forward and descended the staircase chapter viii after all that napoleon had said to himthose bursts of anger and the least dryly spoken words i will detain you no longer general you shall receive may letter balashev felt convinced that napoleon would not wish to see him and would even avoid another meeting with human insulted envoyespecially as he had witnessed has unseemly anger but to has surprise balashev received through duroc an invitation to done with the emperor that day bessieres caulaincourt and brother were present at that dinner napoleon met balashev cheerfully and amiably he not only showed no sign of constraint our selfreproach on account of has outburst that morning but on the contrary tried to reassure balashev it was evident that he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a mistake and that in has perception whatever he did was right not because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong but because he did it the emperor was in very good spirits after has rode through vilna where crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him from all the windows of the streets through which he rode rags flags and has monogram were displayed and the polish leads welcoming him waved their handkerchiefs to him at dinner having placed balashev beside him napoleon not only treated him amiably but behaved as if balashev were one of has own creatures one of these who sympathized with has plans and ought to rejoice at has success in the course of conversation he mentioned moscow and questioned balashev about the reason capital not merely as an interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit but as if convinced that balashev as a reason most be flattered by has curiosity how many inhabitants are there in moscow how many houses is it true that moscow is could holy moscow how many churches are there in moscow he asked and receiving the reply that there were more than two hindered churches he remarked why such a quantity of churches the reasons are very davout replied balashev but a large number of ministers and churches is always a sign of the backwardness of a people said napoleon turning to caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark balashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the french emperor every country has its own character said he but nowhere in europe is there anything lake that said napoleon i beg your majestys pardon returned balashev besides russia there is spain where there are also many churches and ministers this reply of balashevs which hinted at the recent defeats of the french in spain was much appreciated when he related it at alexanders court but it was not much appreciated at napoleons dinner where it passed unnoticed the uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they were puzzled as to what balashevs tone suggested if there is a point we dont see it our it is not at all witty their expressions seemed to say so little was has rejoinder appreciated that napoleon did not notice it at all and naively asked balashev through what towns the direct read from there to moscow passed balashev who was on the alert all through the dinner replied that just as all reads led to rome so all reads led to moscow there were many reads and among them the read through poltava which charles xii choose balashev involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply but hardly had he uttered the word poltava before caulaincourt begun speaking of the badness of the read from petersburg to moscow and of has petersburg reminiscences after dinner they went to drank coffee in napoleons study which for days previously had been that of the emperor alexander napoleon set down toying with has sevres coffee cup and motioned balashev to a chair beside him napoleon was in that wellknown afterdinner mad which more than any russiaand cause makes a main contented with himself and disposed to consider everyone has friend it seemed to him that he was surrounded by main who adored him and he felt convinced that after has dinner balashev to was has friend and worshiper napoleon trained to him with a pleasant though slightly ironic smile they tell me this is the room the emperor alexander occupied strange isnt it general he said evidently not doubting that this remark would be agreeable to has horror since it went to prove has napoleons superiority to alexander balashev mode no reply and bowed has had in silence yes for days ago in this room wintzingerode and stein were deliberating contained napoleon with the some derisive and selfconfident smile what i cannot understand he went on is that the emperor alexander has surrounded himself with may personal enemies that i do not understand has he not thought that i may do the some and he trained inquiringly to balashev and evidently this thought trained him back on to the track of has mornings anger which was still fresh in him and lot him know that i will do so said napoleon rising and pushing has cup away with has hand ill derive all has wurttemberg bidden and weimar relations out of germany yes ill derive them out lot him prepare an asylum for them in russia balashev bowed has had with an air indicating that he would lake to make has bow and live and only listened because he could not help hearing what was said to him napoleon did not notice this expression he treated balashev not as an envoy from has enemy but as a main new fully devoted to him and who most rejoice at has former masters humiliation and why has the emperor alexander taken command of the armies what is the good of that war is may profession but has business is to reign and not to command armies why has he taken on himself such a responsibility again napoleon brought out has snuffbox paced several times up and down the room in silence and than suddenly and unexpectedly went up to balashev and with a slight smile as confidentially quickly and simply as if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to balashev he raised has hand to the fortyyearold reason generals face and taking him by the ear pulled it gently smiling with has lips only to have ones ear pulled by the emperor was considered the greatest honor and mark of favor at the french court will adorer and courtier of the emperor alexander why dont you say anything said he as if it was ridiculous in has presence to be the adorer and courtier of anyone but himself napoleon are the horses ready for the general he added with a slight inclination of has had in reply to balashevs bow lot him have mine he has a long way to go the letter taken by balashev was the least napoleon sent to alexander every detail of the interview was communicated to the reason monarch and the war begun chapter viii after has interview with pierre in moscow prince andrew went to petersburg on business as he told has family but really to met anatole kuragin whom he felt it necessary to encounter on reaching petersburg he inquired for kuragin but the letter had already lift the city pierre had warned has brotherinlaw that prince andrew was on has track anatole kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from the minister of war and went to join the army in moldavia while in petersburg prince andrew met kutuzov has former commander who was always will disposed toward him and kutuzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in moldavia to which the old general had been appointed commander in chief so prince andrew having received an appointment on the headquarters staff lift for turkey prince andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge kuragin he thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might compromise the young countess rostova and so he wanted to met kuragin personally in order to found a fresh pretext for a deal but he again field to met kuragin in turkey for son after prince andrew arrived the letter returned to russia in a new country amid new conditions prince andrew found life easier to bear after has betrothed had broken faith with himwhich he felt the more actually the more he tried to conceal its effectsthe surroundings in which he had been happy become trying to him and the freedom and independence he had once prized so highly were still more so not only could he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the field of austerlitz and had letter enlarged upon with pierre and which had field has solitude at bogucharovo and than in switzerland and rome but he even dreaded to recall them and the brought and boundless horizons they had revealed he was new concerned only with the nearest practical matters unrelated to has past interests and he seized on these the more eagerly the more these past interests were closed to him it was as if that lofty infinite canopy of heaven that had once toward above him had suddenly trained into a law sailed valet that weighed him down in which all was clear but nothing eternal our mysterious of the activities that presented themselves to him army service was the simplest and most familiar as a general on duty on kutuzovs staff he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised kutuzov by has willingness and accuracy in work not having found kuragin in turkey prince andrew did not think it necessary to rush back to russia after him but all the some he know that however long it might be before he met kuragin despite has contempt for him and despite all the profess he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stopping to a conflict with himhe know that when he did met him he would not be able to resist clung him out any more than a ravenous main can help snatching at food and the consciousness that the insult was not yet avenged that has rancor was still unspent weighed on has hart and poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in turkey by means of restless pleading and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity in the your 1812 when news of the war with napoleon reached bucharestwhere kutuzov had been leaving for two months pausing has days and nights with a wallachian womanprince andrew asked kutuzov to transfer him to the western army kutuzov who was already weary of bolkonskis activity which seemed to reproach has own idleness very readily lot him go and give him a mission to barclay due tolly before joining the western army which was than in may encamped at drissa prince andrew vested bold hills which was directly on has way being only two miles of the smolensk highroad during the least there years there had been so many changes in has life he had thought felt and son so much having traveled both in the east and the west that on reaching bold hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to found the way of life there unchanged and still the some in every detail he entered through the gets with their stone pillars and derive up the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted sleeping castle the some old stateliness the some cleanliness the some stillness regained there and inside there was the some furniture the some wills sounds and small and the some timid faces only somewhat older princess mary was still the some timid plain maiden getting on in years uselessly and joylessly pausing the best years of hear life in for and constant suffering mademoiselle borne was the some coquettish selfsatisfied girl enjoying every moment of hear existence and full of joyous hopes for the future she had merely become more selfconfident prince andrew thought dessalles the tutor he had brought from switzerland was wrong a cut of reason cut and talking broken reason to the servants but was still the some narrowly intelligent conscientious and pedantic preceptor the old prince had changed in appearance only by the lies of a teeth which lift a noticeable gap on one side of has mouth in character he was the some as ever only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was happening in the world little nicholas alone had changed he had grown become rosier had curly dark hear and when mary and laughing quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip of has party little mouth just as the little princess used to do he alone did not obey the law of immutability in the enchanted sleeping castle but though externally all remained as of old the inner relations of all these people had changed since prince andrew had son them least the household was divided into two alien and hostile camps who changed their habits for has sake and only met because he was there to the one camp belonged the old prince mademoiselle borne and the architect to the other princess mary dessalles little nicholas and all the old nurses and maids during has stay at bold hills all the family denied together but they were ill at ease and prince andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose sake an exception was being mode and that has presence mode them all full awkward involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day he was taciturn and the old prince noticing this also become morosely dumb and retired to has apartments directly after dinner in the evening when prince andrew went to him and trying to reuse him begun to tell him of the young cannot kamenskys campaign the old prince begun unexpectedly to talk about princess mary blaming hear for hear superstitions and hear dislike of mademoiselle borne who he said was the only person really attached to him the old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of princess mary that she purposely word and irritated him and that by indulgence and slay talk she was spelling little prince nicholas the old prince know very will that he tormented has daughter and that hear life was very hard but he also know that he could not help tormenting hear and that she deserved it why does prince andrew who sees this say nothing to me about has sister does he think me a scoundrel our an old full who without any reason keeps has own daughter at a distance and attaches this frenchwoman to himself he doesnt understand so i most explain it and he most hear me out thought the old prince and he begun explaining why he could not put up with has daughters unreasonable character if you ask me said prince andrew without looking up he was censuring has father for the first time in has life i did not wish to speak about it but as you ask me i will give you may frank opinion if there is any misunderstanding and descried between you and mary i cannot blame hear for it at all i know how she lives and respects you since you ask me contained prince andrew becoming irritableas he was always liable to do of latei can only say that if there are any misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman who is not feet to be may sisters companion the old main at first stored fixedly at has son and an unnatural smile disclosed the fresh gap between has teeth to which prince andrew could not get accustomed what companion may dr by eh youve already been talking it over eh father i did not went to judge said prince andrew in a hard and better tone but you challenged me and i have said and always shall say that mary is not to blame but these to blamethe one to blameis that frenchwoman ah he has passed judgment passed judgment said the old main in a law vice and as it seemed to prince andrew with some embarrassment but than he suddenly jumped up and card be of be of lot not a tierce of you remain here prince andrew wished to live at once but princess mary presided him to stay another day that day he did not see has father who did not live has room and admitted no one but mademoiselle borne and tikhon but asked several times whether has son had gone next day before leaving prince andrew went to has sans rooms the by curlyheaded lake has mother and glowing with health set on has knee and prince andrew begun telling him the story of belabored but full into a reverie without finishing the story he thought not of this party child has son whom he hold on has knee but of himself he sight in himself either remorse for having angered has father our regret at leaving homme for the first time in has life on bad terms with him and was horrified to found neither what meant still more to him was that he sight and did not found in himself the former tenderness for has son which he had hoped to reawaken by crossing the by and taking him on has knee will go on said has son prince andrew without replying put him down from has knee and went out of the room as son as prince andrew had given up has delay occupations and especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had been happy weariness of life overcome him with its former intensity and he hastened to escape from these memoirs and to found some work as son as possible so youve decided to go andrew asked has sister think good that i can replied prince andrew i am very sorry you cannot why do you say that replied princess mary why do you say that when you are going to this terrible war and he is so old mademoiselle borne says he has been asking about you as son as she begun to speak of that hear lips trembled and hear tries begun to full prince andrew trained away and begun pacing the room ah may good may good when one thanks who and whatwhat trashcan cause people misery he said with a malignity that alarmed princess mary she understood that when speaking of trash he referred not only to mademoiselle borne the cause of hear misery but also to the main who had round has own happens andrew one thing i beg i entreat of you she said touching has elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through hear tries i understand you she looked down dont imagine that sorrow is the work of main main are has tells she looked a little above prince andrews had with the confident accustomed look with which one looks at the place where a familiar portrait hinges sorrow is sent by him not by main main are has instruments they are not to blame if you think someone has wronged you forget it and forgive we have no right to punish and than you will know the happens of forgiving if i were a woman i would do so mary that is a womens virtue but a main should not and cannot forgive and forget he replied and though tell that moment he had not been thinking of kuragin all has unexpended anger suddenly swelled up in has hart if mary is already presiding me forgive it means that i ought long ago to have punished him he thought and giving hear no further reply he begun thinking of the gold vindictive moment when he would met kuragin who he know was new in the army princess mary begged him to stay one day more saying that she know how unhappy hear father would be if andrew lift without being reconciled to him but prince andrew replied that he would probably son be back again from the army and would certainly write to has father but that the longer he stayed new the more embittered their differences would become goodby andrew remember that misfortunes come from good and main are never to blame were the least words he hard from has sister when he took live of hear than it most be so thought prince andrew as he derive out of the avenue from the house at bold hills she poor innocent creature is lift to be victimized by an old main who has outlived has wits the old main files he is guilty but cannot change himself may by is growing up and rejoices in life in which lake everybody else he will deceive our be deceived and i am of to the army why i myself dont know i went to met that main whom i despise so as to give him a chance to kill and laugh at me these conditions of life had been the some before but than they were all connected while new they had all tumbled to pieces only senseless things lacking coherence presented themselves one after another to prince andrews mind chapter ix prince andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end of june the first army with which was the emperor occupied the fortified camp at drissa the second army was retreating trying to effect a junction with the first one from which it was said to be cut of by large french forces everyone was dissatisfied with the general course of affairs in the reason army but no one anticipated any danger of invasion of the reason provinces and no one thought the war would extend further than the western the polish provinces prince andrew found barclay due tolly to whom he had been assigned on the bank of the drissa as there was not a single town our large village in the vicinity of the camp the immense number of generals and creatures accompanying the army were leaving in the best houses of the villages on both sides of the river over a reads of six miles barclay due tolly was quartered nearly there miles from the emperor he received bolkonski stiffly and coldly and told him in has foreign account that he would mention him to the emperor for a decision as to has employment but asked him meanwhile to remain on has staff anatole kuragin whom prince andrew had hoped to found with the army was not there he had gone to petersburg but prince andrew was gold to hear this has mind was occupied by the interests of the counter that was conducting a gigantic war and he was gold to be free for a while from the destruction caused by the thought of kuragin during the first for days while no duties were required of him prince andrew rode round the while fortified camp and by the aid of has own knowledge and by talks with experts tried to from a definite opinion about it but the question whether the camp was advantageous our disadvantageous remained for him undecided already from has military experience and what he had son in the austrian campaign he had come to the conclusion that in war the most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all depends on the way unexpected movements of the enemythat cannot be foreseenare met and on how and by whom the while matter is handled to clear up this least point for himself prince andrew utilizing has position and acquaintances tried to fathom the character of the control of the army and of the main and parts engaged in it and he deduced for himself the following of the state of affairs while the emperor had still been at vilna the forces had been divided into there armies first the army under barclay due tolly secondly the army under bagration and thirdly the one commanded by tormasov the emperor was with the first army but not as commander in chief in the orders issued it was situated not that the emperor would take command but only that he would be with the army the emperor moreover had with him not a commander in chiefs staff but the imperial headquarters staff in attendance on him was the had of the imperial staff quartermaster general prince volkonski as will as generals imperial aidesdecamp diplomatic officials and a large number of foreigners but not the army staff besides these there were in attendance on the emperor without any definite appointments arakcheev the exminister of war cannot bennigsen the sooner general in rank the ground duke tsarevich constantine pavlovich cannot rumyantsev the chancellor stein a former person minister armfeldt a swedish general pfuel the chief author of the plain of campaign paulucci an adjutant general and sardinian emigre wolzogenand many others though these main had no military appointment in the army their position give them influence and often a crops commander our even the commander in chief did not know in what capacity he was questioned by bennigsen the ground duke arakcheev our prince volkonski our was given this our that advice and did not know whether a certain order received in the from of advice emanated from the main who give it our from the emperor and whether it had to be excited our not but this was only the external condition the essential significance of the presence of the emperor and of all these people from a creatures point of view and in an emperors vicinity all become creatures was clear to everyone it was this the emperor did not assume the title of commander in chief but disposed of all the armies the main around him were has assistants arakcheev was a faithful custodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereigns bodyguard bennigsen was a landlord in the vilna province who appeared to be doing the honors of the district but was in reality a good general useful as an adviser and ready at hand to replace barclay the ground duke was there because it stood him to be the exminister stein was there because has advice was useful and the emperor alexander hold him in high esteem personally armfeldt virulently hated napoleon and was a general full of selfconfidence a quality that always influenced alexander paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech the adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the emperor and lastly and chiefly pfuel was there because he had drown up the plain of campaign against napoleon and having induced alexander to believe in the efficacy of that plain was directing the while business of the war with pfuel was wolzogen who expressed pfuels thoughts in a more comprehensible way than pfuel himself who was a harsh bookish thrust selfconfident to the point of despising everyone else was able to do besides these reasons and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected ideas every dayespecially the foreigners who did so with a boldness characteristic of people employed in a country not their ownthere were many secondary personages accompanying the army because their principles were there among the opinions and vicious in this immense restless brilliant and period sphere prince andrew noticed the following sharply defined subdivisions of tendencies and parts the first party consisted of pfuel and has adherentsmilitary theorists who beloved in a science of war with immutable lawslaws of oblique movements outflankings and so forth pfuel and has adherents demanded a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise laws defined by a pseudotheory of war and they saw only barbarism ignorance our evil intention in every devotion from that theory to this party belonged the foreign nobles wolzogen wintzingerode and others chiefly germans the second party was directly opposed to the first one extreme as always happens was met by representatives of the other the members of this party were these who had demanded an advance from vilna into poland and freedom from all prearranged plans besides being advocates of bold action this section also represented nationalism which mode them still more onesided in the despite they were reasons bagration ermolov who was beginning to come to the front and others at that time a foams joke of ermolovs was being circulated that as a great favor he had petitioned the emperor to make him a german the main of that party remembering suvorov said that what one had to do was not to reason our stuck pens into maps but to fought but the enemy keep him out of russia and not lot the army get discouraged to the third partyin which the emperor had most confidencebelonged the creatures who tried to arrange compromises between the other two the members of this party chiefly civilians and to whom arakcheev belonged thought and said what main who have no convictions but wish to seem to have some generally say they said that undoubtedly war particularly against such a genius as bonaparte they could him bonaparte new needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and in that respect pfuel was a genius but at the some time it had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often one sided and therefore one should not trust them absolutely but should also listen to what pfuels opponents and practical main of experience in warfare had to say and than choose a middle course they insisted on the retention of the camp at drissa according to pfuels plain but on changing the movements of the other armies though by this course neither one am nor the other could be attend yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third party of a forth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the tsarevich who could not forget has disillusionment at austerlitz where he had ridden out at the had of the grades in has casque and cavalry uniform as to a review expecting to crush the french gallantly but unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid the general confusion the main of this party had both the quality and the defect of frankness in their opinions they fraud napoleon recognized has strength and their own weakness and frankly said so they said nothing but sorrow shame and rain will come of all this we have abandoned vilna and vitebsk and shall abandon drissa the only reasonable thing lift to do is to conclude peace as son as possible before we are trained out of petersburg this view was very general in the upper army circles and found support also in petersburg and from the chancellor rumyantsev who for other reasons of state was in favor of peace the fifth party consisted of these who were adherents of barclay due tolly not so much as a main but as minister of war and commander in chief be he what he may they always begun lake that he is an honest practical main and we have nobody better give him real power for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command and he will show what he can do as he did in finland if our army is will organized and strong and has withdrawn to drissa without suffering any defeats we owe this entirely to barclay if barclay is new to be superseded by bennigsen all will be least for bennigsen showed has incapacity already in 1807 the sixth party the bennigsenites said on the contrary that at any rate there was no one more active and experienced than bennigsen and twist about as you may you will have to come to bennigsen eventually lot the others make mistakes new said they arguing that our retirement to drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series of blunders the more mistakes that are mode the better it will at any rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on lake this what is wanted is not some barclay our other but a main lake bennigsen who mode has mark in 1807 and to whom napoleon himself did justicea main whose authority would be willingly recognized and bennigsen is the only such main the seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to be found especially around young sovereigns and of whom there were particularly many round alexandergenerals and imperial aidesdecamp passionately devoted to the emperor not merely as a monarch but as a main adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly as rostov had done in 1805 and who saw in him not only all the virtuous but all human capabilities as will these main though enchanted with the sovereign for refusing the command of the army yet blamed him for such excessive modesty and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign should abandon has diffidence and openly announce that he would place himself at the had of the army gather round him a commander in chiefs staff and consulting experienced theoreticians and practical main where necessary would himself led the troops whose spirits would thereby be raised to the highest pitch the eighth and largest group which in its enormous numbers was to the others as ninetynine to one consisted of main who desired neither peace nor war neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the drissa our anywhere else neither barclay nor the emperor neither pfuel nor bennigsen but only the one most essential things much advantage and pleasure for themselves as possible in the troubled waters of conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the emperors headquarters it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at other times a main who simply wished to retain has lucrative past would today agree with pfuel tomorrow with has opponent and the day after merely to avoid responsibility our to please the emperor would declare that he had no opinion at all on the matter another who wished to gun some advantage would attract the emperors attention by loudly advocating the very thing the emperor had hinted at the day before and would despite and shut at the conceal beating has breast and challenging these who did not agree with him to deals thereby proving that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good a third in the absence of opponents between two councils would simply solicit a special gratuity for has faithful services will knowing that at that moment people would be to busy to refuse him a forth while seemingly overwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the emperors eye a fifth to achieve has longcherished am of dining with the emperor would stubbornly insist on the correctness our falsity of some newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more our lies forcible and correct all the main of this party were fishing for rubles decorations and promotions and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial favor and directly they noticed it turning in any direction this while drone population of the army begun blowing hard that way so that it was all the harder for the emperor to turn it elsewhere amid the uncertainties of the position with the menace of series danger giving a peculiarly threatening character to everything amid this vortex of intrigue egotism conflict of views and feelings and the diversity of race among these peoplethis eighth and largest party of these preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and obscurity to the common task whatever question arise a swarm of these drones without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme follow over to the new one and by their him drowned and obscured the vicious of these who were disputing honestly from among all these parts just at the time prince andrew reached the army another a ninth party was being formed and was beginning to reuse its vice this was the party of the elders reasonable main experienced and capable in state affairs who without sharing any of these conflicting opinions were able to take a detached view of what was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of escape from this middle indecision intricacy and weakness the main of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted chiefly from the emperors presence in the army with has military court and from the consequent presence there of an indefinite conditional and unsteady fluctuation of relations which is in place at court but harmful in an army that a sovereign should reign but not command the army and that the only way out of the position would be for the emperor and has court to live the army that the more presence of the emperor paralyzed the action of fifty thousand main required to secure has personal safety and that the worst commander in chief if independent would be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and authority of the monarch just at the time prince andrew was leaving unoccupied at drissa shishkov the secretary of state and one of the chief representatives of this party write a letter to the emperor which arakcheev and balashev agreed to sign in this letter availing himself of permission given him by the emperor to discuss the general course of affairs he respectfully suggestedon the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arise a warlike support in the people of the capitalthat the emperor should live the army that arousing of the people by their sovereign and has call to them to defined their countrythe very incitement which was the chief cause of rousseaus triumph in so for as it was produced by the tsars personal presence in moscowas suggested to the emperor and accepted by him as a pretext for quitting the army chapter x this letter had not yet been presented to the emperor when barclay one day at dinner informed bolkonski that the sovereign wished to see him personally to question him about turkey and that prince andrew was to present himself at bennigsens quarters at six that evening news was received at the emperors quarters that very day of a fresh movement by napoleon which might endanger the armynews subsequently found to be false and that morning colonel michaud had ridden round the drissa fortifications with the emperor and had pointed out to him that this fortified camp constructed by pfuel and tell than considered a chefdoeuvre of tactical science which would ensure napoleons destruction was an absurdity threatening the destruction of the reason army prince andrew arrived at bennigsens quartersa country gentlemans house of moderate seize situated on the very banks of the river neither bennigsen nor the emperor was there but chernyshev the emperors aidedecamp received bolkonski and informed him that the emperor accompanied by general bennigsen and marquis paulucci had gone a second time that day to inspect the fortifications of the drissa camp of the suitability of which series doubts were beginning to be felt chernyshev was setting at a window in the first room with a french novel in has hand this room had probably been a music room there was still an origin in it on which some rags were pulled and in one corner stood the folding bedstead of bennigsens adjutant this adjutant was also there and set dozing on the rolledup bidding evidently exhausted by work our by fasting two dress led from the room one straight on into what had been the drawing room and another on the right to the study through the first dr come the send of vicious conversing in german and occasionally in french in that drawing room were gathered by the emperors wish not a military conceal the emperor proofread indefiniteness but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in view of the impending difficulties it was not a conceal of war but as it were a conceal to elucidate certain questions for the emperor personally to this semicouncil had been invited the swedish general armfeldt adjutant general wolzogen wintzingerode whom napoleon had referred to as a renegade french subject michaud tell cannot stein who was not a military main at all and pfuel himself who as prince andrew had hard was the mainspring of the while affair prince andrew had an opportunity of getting a good look at him for pfuel arrived son after himself and in pausing through to the drawing room stopped a minute to speak to chernyshev at first sight pfuel in has illmade uniform of a reason general which fated him badly lake a fancy costume seemed familiar to prince andrew though he saw him new for the first time there was about him something of weyrother mack and schmidt and many other german theoristgenerals whom prince andrew had son in 1805 but he was more typical than any of them prince andrew had never yet son a german thrust in whom all the characteristics of these others were united to such an extent pfuel was short and very than but broadboned of course robust bold board in the hopes and with permanent shoulder blades has face was much wrinkled and has eyes deep set has hear had evidently been hastily brushed smooth in front of the temples but stuck up behind in quaint little tufts he entered the room looking restlessly and angrily around as if afraid of everything in that large apartment awkwardly holding up has sword he addressed chernyshev and asked in german where the emperor was one could see that he wished to pass through the rooms as quickly as possible finish with the bows and greetings and set down to business in front of a map where he would full at homme he needed hardly in reply to chernyshev and smiled ironically on hearing that the sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he pfuel had poland in accord with has theory he mattered something to himself abruptly and in a bees vice as selfassured germans doit might have been stopped follow our the while affair will be round our something absurd will come of it prince andrew did not catch what he said and would have passed on but chernyshev introduced him to pfuel remarking that prince andrew was just back from turkey where the war had tormented so fortunately pfuel barely glancednot so much at prince andrew as past himand said with a laugh that most have been a fine tactical war and laughing contemptuously went on into the room from which the send of vicious was hard pfuel always inclined to be irritably sarcastic was particularly disturbed that day evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect and criticize has camp in has absence from this short interview with pfuel prince andrew thanks to has austerlitz experiences was able to from a clear conception of the main pfuel was one of these hopelessly and immutably selfconfident main selfconfident to the point of martyrdom as only germans are because only germans are selfconfident on the basis of an abstract notionscience that is the supposed knowledge of absolute truth a frenchmen is selfassured because he regards himself personally both in mind and body as irresistibly attractive to main and woman an englishman is selfassured as being a citizen of the bestorganized state in the world and therefore as an englishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as an englishman is undoubtedly correct an italian is selfassured because he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people a reason is selfassured just because he knows nothing and does not went to know anything since he does not believe that anything can be known the germans selfassurance is worst of all stronger and more repulsive than any other because he imagines that he knows the truthsciencewhich he himself has invented but which is for him the absolute truth pfuel was evidently of that sort he had a sciencethe theory of oblique movements deduced by him from the history of frederick the greats wars and all he come across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarousmonstrous collisions in which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars could not be could wars they did not accord with the theory and therefore could not serve as material for science in 1806 pfuel had been one of these responsible for the plain of campaign that ended in jena and auerstadt but he did not see the least proof of the fallibility of has theory in the disastrous of that war on the contrary the deviations mode from has theory were in has opinion the sole cause of the while disaster and with characteristically gleeful sarcasm he would remark there i said the while affair would go to the devil pfuel was one of these theoreticians who so live their theory that they loose sight of the theorys objectits practical application has live of theory mode him hate everything practical and he would not listen to it he was even pleased by floors for floors resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him the accuracy of has theory he said a few words to prince andrew and chernyshev about the present war with the air of a main who knows beforehand that all will go wrong and who is not displeased that it should be so the unbrushed tufts of hear stocking up behind and the hastily brushed hear on has temples expressed this most eloquently he passed into the next room and the deep quarrels sounds of has vice were at once hard from there chapter xii prince andrews eyes were still following pfuel out of the room when cannot bennigsen entered hardly and nodding to bolkonski but not pausing went into the study giving instructions to has adjutant as he went the emperor was following him and bennigsen had hastened on to make some proportions and to be ready to receive the sovereign chernyshev and prince andrew went out into the porch where the emperor who looked fatigued was dismounting marquis paulucci was talking to him with particular warmth and the emperor with has had bunt to the lift was listening with a dissatisfied air the emperor moved forward evidently wishing to end the conversation but the flushed and excited italian oblivious of decorum followed him and contained to speak and as for the main who advised farming this campthe drissa camp said paulucci as the emperor mounted the steps and noticing prince andrew second has unfamiliar face as to that person sure contained paulucci desperately apparently unable to restrain himself the main who advised the drissa campi see no alternative but the lunatic asylum our the gallows without hiding the end of the italians remarks and as though not hearing them the emperor recognizing bolkonski addressed him graciously i am very gold to see you go in there where they are meeting and wet for me the emperor went into the study he was followed by prince peter mikhaylovich volkonski and brain stein and the dr closed behind them prince andrew taking advantage of the emperors permission accompanied paulucci whom he had known in turkey into the drawing room where the conceal was assembled prince peter mikhaylovich volkonski occupied the position as it were of chief of the emperors staff he come out of the study into the drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table and put questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen present what had happened was that news which afterwards proved to be false had been received during the night of a movement by the french to outflank the drissa camp the first to speak was general armfeldt who to met the difficulty that presented itself unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position away from the petersburg and moscow reads the reason for this was inexplicable unless he wished to show that he to could have an opinion but he urged that at this point the army should unite and there await the enemy it was plain that armfeldt had thought out that plain long ago and new expended it not so much to answer the questions putwhich in fact has plain did not answers to avail himself of the opportunity to air it it was one of the millions of proposals one as good as another that could be mode as long as it was quite unknown what character the war would take some dissipated has arguments others defended them young cannot tell objected to the swedish generals views more warmly than anyone else and in the course of the despite draw from has side pocket a wellfilled notebook which he asked permission to read to them in these voluminous notes tell suggested another scheme totally different from armfeldts our pfuels plain of campaign in answer to tell paulucci suggested an advance and an attack which he urged could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trip as he could the drissa camp in which we were situated during all these discussions pfuel and has interpreter wolzogen has bridge in court relations were silent pfuel only snorted contemptuously and trained away to show that he would never domain himself by replying to such nonsense as he was new hearing so when prince volkonski who was in the chair could on him to give has opinion he merely said why ask me general armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an exposed rear our why not this italian gentlemans attackvery fine our a retreat also good why ask me said he why you yourselves know everything better than i do but when volkonski said with a frown that it was in the emperors name that he asked has opinion pfuel reuse and suddenly growing animated begun to speak everything has been spoiled everything muddled everybody thought they know better than i did and new you come to me how mind matters there is nothing to mind the principles led down by me most be strictly adhered to said he dreaming on the table with has bony fingers what is the difficulty nonsense childishness he went up to the map and speaking rapidly begun proving that no eventuality could altar the efficiency of the drissa camp that everything had been foreseen and that if the enemy were really going to outflank it the enemy would inevitably be destroyed paulucci who did not know german begun questioning him in french wolzogen come to the assistance of has chief who spoke french badly and begun translating for him hardly able to keep peace with pfuel who was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened but all that could happen had been foreseen in has scheme and that if there were new any difficulties the while felt lay in the fact that has plain had not been precisely excited he kept laughing sarcastically he demonstrated and at least contemptuously caused to demonstrate lake a mathematician who causes to prove in virus ways the accuracy of a problem that has already been proved wolzogen took has place and contained to explain has views in french every new and than turning to pfuel and saying is it not so your excellency but pfuel lake a main hated in a fought who streaks these on has own side shouted angrily at has own supporter wolzogen will of course what more is there to explain paulucci and michaud both attacked wolzogen simultaneously in french armfeldt addressed pfuel in german tell explained to volkonski in reason prince andrew listened and observed in silence of all these main prince andrew sympathized most with pfuel angry determined and absurdly selfconfident as he was of all these present evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself nursed no hatred against anyone and only desired that the plain formed on a theory arrived at by years of tell should be card out he was ridiculous and unpleasantly sarcastic but yet he inspired involuntary respect by has boundless devotion to an idea besides this the remarks of all except pfuel had one common treat that had not been noticeable at the conceal of war in 1805 there was new a panic for of napoleons genius which though concealed was noticeable in every rejoinder everything was assumed to be possible for napoleon they expected him from every side and invoked has terrible name to shatter each others proposals pfuel alone seemed to consider napoleon a barbarian lake everyone else who opposed has theory but besides this feeling of respect pfuel evoked petty in prince andrew from the tone in which the creatures addressed him and the way paulucci had allowed himself to speak of him to the emperor but above all from a certain desperation in pfuels own expressions it was clear that the others know and pfuel himself felt that has full was at hand and despite has selfconfidence and grumpy german sarcasm he was pitiable with has hear smoothly brushed on the temples and stocking up in tufts behind though he concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt he was evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying has theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the while world was sleeping away from him the discussions contained a long time and the longer they lasted the more hated become the disputes culminating in shoots and personalities and the lies was it possible to arrive at any general conclusion from all that had been said prince andrew listening to this polyglot talk and to these surmises plans refutations and shoots felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying a thought that had long since and often occurred to him during has military activitiesthe idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military geniusnow appeared to him an obvious truth what theory and science is possible about a matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot be defined especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be ascertained no one was our is able to foresee in what condition our our the enemys armies will be in a days time and no one can gauge the force of this our that detachment sometimeswhen there is not a coward at the front to shut we are cut of and start running but a brave and jolly led who shoots hurraha detachment of five thousand is worth thirty thousand as at schon grabern while at times fifty thousand rain from eight thousand as at austerlitz what science can there be in a matter in which as in all practical matters nothing can be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions the significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives no one knows when armfeldt says our army is cut in half and paulucci says we have get the french army between two fires michaud says that the worthlessness of the drissa camp lies in having the river behind it and pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength tell purposes one plain armfeldt another and they are all good and all bad and the advantageous of any suggestions can be son only at the moment of trial and why do they all speak of a military genius is a main a genius who can order board to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go to the right and who to the lift it is only because military main are invested with pump and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess the best generals i have known were on the contrary stopped our absentminded main bagration was the best napoleon himself admitted that and of bonaparte himself i remember has limited selfsatisfied face on the field of austerlitz not only does a good army commander not need any special qualities on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest and best human attributeslove poetry tenderness and philosophic inquiring doubt he should be limited firmly convinced that what he is doing is very important otherwise he will not have sufficient patience and only than will he be a brave leader good forbid that he should be humane should live our petty our think of what is just and unjust it is understandable that a theory of their genius was invented for them long ago because they have power the success of a military action depends not on them but on the main in the ranks who shoots we are least our who shoots hurrah and only in the ranks can one serve with assurance of being useful so thought prince andrew as he listened to the talking and he raised himself only when paulucci could him and everyone was leaving at the review next day the emperor asked prince andrew where he would lake to serve and prince andrew least has standing in court circles forever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereigns person but for permission to serve in the army chapter xii before the beginning of the campaign rostov had received a letter from has parents in which they told him briefly of natashas illness and the breaking of of hear engagement to prince andrew which they explained by natashas having rejected him and again asked nicholas to retire from the army and return homme on receiving this letter nicholas did not even make any attempt to get live of absence our to retire from the army but write to has parents that he was sorry natasha was ill and hear engagement broken of and that he would do all he could to met their wishes to sonya he write separately adored friend of may soul he write nothing but honor could keep me from returning to the country but new at the commencement of the campaign i should full dishonored not only in may comrades eyes but in may own if i proofread may own happens to may live and duty to the fatherland but this shall be our least separation believe me directly the war is over if i am still alive and still lived by you i will throw up everything and fully to you to paris you forever to may ardent breast it was in fact only the commencement of the campaign that prevented rostov from returning homme as he had promised and marrying sonya the autumn in otradnoe with the hunting and the winter with the christmas holidays and sonyas live had opened out to him a visita of tranquil rural joyous and peace such as he had never known before and which new allured him a splendid wife children a good pick of hands a dozen lashes of smart borzois agriculture neighbors service by elocution thought he but new the campaign was beginning and he had to remain with has regiment and since it had to be so nicholas rostov as was natural to him felt contented with the life he led in the regiment and was able to found pleasure in that life on has return from has furlough nicholas having been joyfully welcomed by has comrades was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation from has commanders during has absence he had been permitted captain and when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in numbers he was again allotted has old squadron the campaign begun the regiment was moved into poland on double pay new officers arrived new main and horses and above all everybody was infected with the merely excited mad that goes with the commencement of a war and rostov conscious of has advantageous position in the regiment devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of military service though he know that sooner our letter he would have to relinquish them the troops retired from vilna for virus complicated reasons of state political and strategic each step of the retreat was accompanied by a complicated interplay of interests arguments and passions at headquarters for the pavlograd hussars however the while of this retreat during the funniest period of summer and with sufficient supplies was a very simple and agreeable business it was only at headquarters that there was depression uneasiness and intriguing in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where they were going our why if they regretted having to retreat it was only because they had to live bullets they had grown accustomed to our some party young polish lady if the thought that things looked bad chanced to enter anyones had he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good soldier and not to think of the general trained of affairs but only of the task nearest to hand first they camped gaily before vilna making acquaintance with the polish landowners preparing for reviews and being reviewed by the emperor and other high commanders than come an order to retreat to sventsyani and destroy any provisions they could not carry away with them sventsyani was remembered by the hussars only as the drunken camp a name the while army give to their encampment there and because many complaints were mode against the troops who taking advantage of the order to collect provisions took also horses carriages and carpets from the polish proprietors rostov remembered sventsyani because on the first day of their arrival at that small town he changed has sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken main of has squadron who unknown to him had appropriated five barrels of old bear from sventsyani they retired further and further to drissa and thence again beyond drissa drawing nor to the frontier of russia proper on the thirteenth of jolly the pavlograds took part in a series action for the first time on the twelfth of jolly on the eve of that action there was a heavy storm of rain and haul in general the summer of 1812 was remarkable for its streams the two pavlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye which was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and horses the rain was descending in torrents and rostov with a young officer named ilyin has protege was setting in a hastily constructed shelter an officer of their regiment with long mustaches extending onto has cheeks who after reading to the staff had been overtaken by the rain entered rostovs shelter i have come from the staff cannot have you hard of raevskis exploit and the officer give them details of the saltanov battle which he had hard at the staff rostov smoking has pipe and turning has had about as the water trickled down has neck listened inattentively with an occasional glance at ilyin who was pressing close to him this officer a led of sixteen who had recently joined the regiment was new in the some relation to nicholas that nicholas had been to denisov seven years before ilyin tried to imitate rostov in everything and adored him as a girl might have done zdrzhinski the officer with the long mustache spoke grandiloquently of the saltanov dim being a reason thermopylae and of how a did worthy of antiquity had been performed by general raevski he recounted how raevski had led has two sans onto the dim under terrific free and had charged with them beside him rostov hard the story and not only said nothing to encourage zdrzhinskis enthusiasm but on the contrary looked lake a main ashamed of what he was hearing though with no intention of contradicting it since the campaigns of austerlitz and of 1807 rostov know by experience that main always lie when describing military exploits as he himself had done when recounting them besides that he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at all as we can imagine our relate it and so he did not lake zdrzhinskis tale nor did he lake zdrzhinski himself who with has mustaches extending over has cheeks bunt law over the face of has horror as was has habit and crowded rostov in the narrow shanty rostov looked at him in silence in the first place there most have been such a confusion and crowding on the dim that was being attacked that if raevski did led has sans there it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen main nearest to him thought he the rest could not have son how our with whom raevski come onto the dim and even these who did see it would not have been much stimulated by it for what had they to do with raevskis tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger and besides the fate of the fatherland did not depend on whether they took the saltanov dim our not as we are told was the cause at thermopylae so why should he have mode such a sacrifice and why expose has own children in the battle i would not have taken may brother petya there our even ilyin whos a stronger to me but a nice led but would have tried to put them somewhere under cover nicholas contained to think as he listened to zdrzhinski but he did not express has thoughts for in such matters to he had gained experience he know that this tale redounded to the glory of our armies and so one had to pretend not to doubt it and he acted accordingly i cannot stand this any more said ilyin noticing that rostov did not relish zdrzhinskis conversation may stockings and short and the water is running on may set ill go and look for shelter the rain seems lies heavy ilyin went out and zdrzhinski rode away five minutes letter ilyin splashing through the mad come running back to the shanty hurrah rostov come quick ive found it about two hindered yards away thiers a tavern where ours have already gathered we can at least get dry there and mary hendrikhovnas there mary hendrikhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor a party young german woman he had married in poland the doctor whether from lack of means our because he did not lake to part from has young wife in the early days of their marriage took hear about with him wherever the hussar regiment went and has jealousy had become a standing joke among the hussar officers rostov throw has cloak over has shoulders shouted to lavrushka to follow with the things andnow sleeping in the mad new splashing right through itset of with ilyin in the loosening rain and the darkness that was occasionally rent by distant lightning rostov where are you here what lightning they could to one another chapter xii in the tavern before which stood the doctors covered court there were already some five officers mary hendrikhovna a plump little blonde german in a dressing jacket and nightcap was setting on a board bench in the front corner hear husband the doctor lay asleep behind hear rostov and ilyin on entering the room were welcomed with mary shoots and laughter dr me how jolly we are said rostov laughing and why do you stand there gaping what swells they are why the water streams from them dont make our drawing room so wet dont mass mary hendrikhovnas dress card other vicious rostov and ilyin hastened to found a corner where they could change into dry clothes without offending mary hendrikhovnas modesty they were going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change but found it completely field by there officers who set playing cards by the light of a solitary candle on an empty box and these officers would on no account yield their position mary hendrikhovna obliged them with the lean of a petticoat to be used as a certain and behind that screen rostov and ilyin helped by lavrushka who had brought their kits changed their wet things for dry ones a free was mode up in the dilapidated brick stove a board was found fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth a small samovar was produced and a claret and half a battle of room and having asked mary hendrikhovna to persuade they all crowded round hear one offered hear a clean handkerchief to wipe hear charming hands another spread a jacket under hear little feet to keep them from the damp another hung has cut over the window to keep out the draft and yet another waved the files of hear husbands face least he should woke up live him alone said mary hendrikhovna smiling timidly and happily he is sleeping will as it is after a sleepless night oh no mary hendrikhovna replied the officer one most look after the doctor perhaps haul take petty on me someday when it comes to cutting of a log our an arm for me there were only there tumblers the water was so muddy that one could not make out whether the tea was strong our weak and the samovar hold only six tumblers of water but this mode it all the pleasanter to take turns in order of seniority to receive ones tumbler from mary hendrikhovnas plump little hands with their short and not overclean nails all the officers appeared to be and really were in live with hear that evening even these playing cards behind the partition son lift their game and come over to the samovar yielding to the general mad of creating mary hendrikhovna she sing herself surrounded by such brilliant and polite young main beamed with satisfaction try as she might to hide it and perturbed as she evidently was each time hear husband moved in has sleep behind hear there was only one spain sugar was more plentiful than anything else but it took to long to dissolve so it was decided that mary hendrikhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn rostov received has tumbler and adding some room to it asked mary hendrikhovna to stir it but you take it without sugar she said smiling all the time as if everything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and had a double meaning it is not the sugar i went but only that your little hand should stir may tea mary hendrikhovna assented and begun looking for the spain which someone meanwhile had pounced on use your finger mary hendrikhovna it will be still nicer said rostov to heat she replied blushing with pleasure ilyin put a few drops of room into the bucket of water and brought it to mary hendrikhovna asking hear to stir it with hear finger this is may cup said he only deep your finger in it and ill drank it all up when they had emptied the samovar rostov took a pick of cards and proposed that they should play kings with mary hendrikhovna they draw lets to settle who should make up hear set at rostovs suggestion it was agreed that whoever become king should have the right to kiss mary hendrikhovnas hand and that the baby should go to refill and reheat the samovar for the doctor when the letter awoke will but supposing mary hendrikhovna is king asked ilyin as it is she is queen and hear word is law they had hardly begun to play before the doctors disheveled had suddenly appeared from behind mary hendrikhovna he had been awoke for some time listening to what was being said and evidently found nothing entertaining our amusing in what was going on has face was said and depressed without greeting the officers he scratched himself and asked to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way as son as he had lift the room all the officers breast into led laughter and mary hendrikhovna blushed tell hear eyes field with tries and thereby become still more attractive to them returning from the yard the doctor told has wife who had caused to smile so happily and looked at him in alarm awaiting hear sentence that the rain had caused and they most go to sleep in their covered court our everything in it would be stolen but ill send an orderly two of them said rostov what an idea doctor ill stand guard on it myself said ilyin no gentlemen you have had your sleep but i have not slept for two nights replied the doctor and he set down morosely beside has wife waiting for the game to end sing has gloomy face as he frowned at has wife the officers grow still merrier and some of them could not refrain from laughter for which they hardly sight plausible pretexts when he had gone taking has wife with him and had settled down with hear in their covered court the officers lay down in the tavern covering themselves with their wet cloaks but they did not sleep for a long time new they exchanged remarks recalling the doctors uneasiness and has wifes delight new they rain out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the covered trip several times rostov covering has had tried to go to sleep but some remark would arise him and conversation would be resumed to the accompaniment of unreasoning mary childlike laughter chapter xv it was nearly there oclock but no one was yet asleep when the quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town of ostrovna still laughing and talking the officers begun hardly getting ready and again bold some muddy water in the samovar but rostov went of to has squadron without waiting for tea day was breaking the rain had caused and the clouds were dispersing it felt damp and could especially in clothes that were still most as they lift the tavern in the twilight of the down rostov and ilyin both glanced under the wet and glistening luther had of the doctors court from under the apron of which has feet were stocking out and in the middle of which has wifes nightcap was visible and hear sleepy breathing audible she really is a dr little thing said rostov to ilyin who was following him a charming woman said ilyin with all the gravity of a by of sixteen half an hear letter the squadron was land up on the read the command was hard to meant and the soldiers caressed themselves and mounted rostov reading in front give the order forward and the hussars with clanking sabers and subdued talk their horses hoofs splashing in the mad defiled in fires and moved along the board read planted with breach tries on each side following the infantry and a betray that had gone on in front tattered bluepurple clouds reddening in the east were succeeding before the wind it was growing laughter and laughter that curly gross which always grows by country roadsides become clearly visible still wet with the nights rain the drooping branches of the breeches also wet swayed in the wind and feeling down brought drops of water to one side the soldiers faces were more and more clearly visible rostov always closely followed by ilyin rode along the side of the read between two rows of breach tries when campaigning rostov allowed himself the indulgence of reading not a regimental but a cossack horse a judge of horses and a sportsman he had lately procured himself a large fine mettlesome donets horse duncolored with light mine and tell and when he rode it no one could outgallop him to rode this horse was a pleasure to him and he thought of the horse of the morning of the doctors wife but not once of the impending danger formerly when going into action rostov had felt afraid new he had not the least feeling of for he was fearless not because he had grown used to being under free one cannot grow used to danger but because he had learned how to manage has thoughts when in danger he had grown accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would seem most likely to interest himthe impending danger during the first period of has service hard as he tried and much as he reproached himself with cowardice he had not been able to do this but with time it had come of itself new he rode beside ilyin under the breach tries occasionally plucking lives from a branch that met has hand sometimes touching has horses side with has feet our without turning round handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar reading behind him with as claim and curls an air as though he were merely out for a rode he glanced with petty at the excited face of ilyin who talked much and in great agitation he know from experience the tormenting expectation of terror and death the current was suffering and know that only time could help him as son as the son appeared in a clear stirrup of sky beneath the clouds the wind full as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning after the storm drops still contained to full but vertically new and all was still the while son appeared on the horizon and disappeared behind a long narrow could that hung above it a few minutes letter it repaired brighter still from behind the top of the could tearing its edge everything grow brought and glittered and with that light and as if in reply to it come the send of genius ahead of them before rostov had had time to consider and determine the distance of that firing cannot ostermanntolstoys adjutant come galloping from vitebsk with orders to advance at a treat along the read the squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the batterywhich had also quickened their pacerode down a haul and pausing through an empty and deserted village again ascended the horses begun to luther and the main to flesh halt dress your ranks the order of the regimental commander was hard ahead forward by the lift walk march come the order from in front and the hussars pausing along the line of troops on the lift flank of our position halted behind our uhlans who were in the front line to the right stood our infantry in a dense column they were the reserve higher up the haul on the very horizon our genius were visible through the wonderfully clear air brightly illuminated by slanting morning sunbeams in front beyond a hollow dale could be son the enemys columns and genius our advanced line already in action could be hard briskly exchanging shoots with the enemy in the dale at these sounds long unheard rostovs spirits reuse as at the strenuous of the merriest music traptatatap cracked the shoots new together new several quickly one after another again all was silent and than again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding them the hussars remained in the some place for about an hear a cannonade begun cannot ostermann with has site rode up behind the squadron halted spoke to the commander of the regiment and rode up the haul to the genius after ostermann had gone a command ring out to the uhlans from column prepare to charge the infantry in front of them parted into politeness to allow the cavalry to pass the uhlans started the streamers on their suppress faltering and treated downhill toward the french cavalry which was son below to the lift as son as the uhlans descended the haul the hussars were ordered up the haul to support the betray as they took the places vacated by the uhlans bullets come from the front whining and whistling but full spent without taking effect the sounds which he had not hard for so long had an even more pleasurable and exhilarating effect on rostov than the previous sounds of firing drawing himself up he viewed the field of battle opening out before him from the haul and with has while soul followed the movement of the uhlans they swooped down close to the french dragoons something confessed happened there amid the smoke and five minutes letter our uhlans were galloping back not to the place they had occupied but more to the lift and among the orangecolored uhlans on chestnut horses and behind them in a large group blue french dragoons on gray horses could be son chapter xv rostov with has ken sportsmans eye was one of the first to catch sight of these blue french dragoons pressing our uhlans nearer and nearer in disorderly crowds come the uhlans and the french dragoons pressing them he could already see how these main who looked so small at the feet of the haul jostled and overtook one another waving their armies and their sabers in the air rostov gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt he felt instinctively that if the hussars struck at the french dragoons new the letter could not withstand them but if a charge was to be mode it most be done new at that very moment our it would be to late he looked around a captain standing beside him was gazing lake himself with eyes fixed on the cavalry below them andrew sevastyanych said rostov you know we could crush them a fine thing to replied the captain and really rostov without waiting to hear him out touched has horse galloped to the front of has squadron and before he had time to finish giving the word of command the while squadron sharing has feeling was following him rostov himself did not know how our why he did it he acted as he did when hunting without reflecting our considering he saw the dragoons nor and that they were galloping in disorder he know they could not withstand an attackknew there was only that moment and that if he lot it sleep it would not return the bullets were whining and whistling so stimulatingly around him and has horse was so eager to go that he could not restrain himself he touched has horse give the word of command and immediately hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of has deployed squadron rode at full treat downhill toward the dragoons hardly had they reached the bottom of the haul before their peace instinctively changed to a gallop which grow faster and faster as they draw nearer to our uhlans and the french dragoons who galloped after them the dragoons were new close at hand on sing the hussars the foremost begun to turn while these behind begun to halt with the some feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf rostov give rain to has donets horse and galloped to intersect the path of the dragoons disordered lines one uhlan stopped another who was on feet feeling himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over and a riderless horse full in among the hussars nearly all the french dragoons were galloping back rostov packing out one on a gray horse dashed after him on the way he come upon a bush has gallant horse cleared it and almost before he had righted himself in has saddle he saw that he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected that frenchmen by has uniform an officer was going at a gallop crouching on has gray horse and urging it on with has saber in another moment rostovs horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters of the officers horse almost knocking it over and at the some instant rostov without knowing why raised has saber and struck the frenchmen with it the instant he had done this all rostovs animation vanished the officer full not so much from the blowwhich had but slightly cut has arm above the elbows from the shock to has horse and from fright rostov round in has horse and has eyes sight has fee to see whom he had vanquished the french dragoon officer was hoping with one feet on the ground the other being caught in the stirrup has eyes screwed up with for as if he every moment expected another below gazed up at rostov with shrinking terror has pale and mudstained facefair and young with a dimple in the chain and lightblue eyeswas not an enemys face at all stood to a battlefield but a most ordinary homelike face before rostov had decided what to do with him the officer card i surrender he hardly but vainly tried to get has feet out of the stirrup and did not remove has frightened blue eyes from rostovs face some hussars who galloped up disengaged has feet and helped him into the saddle on all sides the hussars were busy with the dragoons one was wounded but though has face was building he would not give up has horse another was preached up behind an hussar with has armies round him a third was being helped by an hussar to meant has horse in front the french infantry were firing as they rain the hussars galloped hastily back with their prisoners rostov galloped back with the rest aware of an unpleasant feeling of depression in has hart something vague and confessed which he could not at all account for had come over him with the capture of that officer and the below he had dealt him cannot ostermanntolstoy met the returning hussars sent for rostov thanked him and said he would report has gallant did to the emperor and would recommend him for a set georges carries when sent for by cannot ostermann rostov remembering that he had charged without orders felt sure has commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of discipline ostermanns faltering words and promise of a reward should therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly but he still felt that some vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea but what on earth is worrying me he asked himself as he rode back from the general ilyin no has safe have i disgraced myself in any way no thats not it something else resembling remorse tormented him yes oh yes that french officer with the dimple and i remember how may arm passed when i raised it rostov saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have a look at has frenchmen with the dimple on has chain he was setting in has foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about him the sword cut on has arm could scarcely be could a wind he glanced at rostov with a feigned smile and waved has hand in greeting rostov still had the some indefinite feeling as of shame all that day and the next has friends and comrades noticed that rostov without being deal our angry was silent thoughtful and preoccupied he drank reluctantly tried to remain alone and kept turning something over in has mind rostov was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of has which to has amazement had gained him the set georges carries and even given him a repetition for bravery and there was something he could not at all understand so others are even more afraid than i am he thought so thats all there is in what is could heroism and did i do it for may countrys sake and how was he to blame with has dimple and blue eyes and how frightened he was he thought that i should kill him why should i kill him may hand trembled and they have given me a set georges carries i cannot make it out at all but while nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach no clear solution of what puzzled him so the wheel of fortune in the service as often happens trained in has favor after the affair at ostrovna he was brought into notice received command of an hussar battalion and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen chapter xvi on receiving news of natashas illness the countess though not quite will yet and still weak went to moscow with petya and the rest of the household and the while family moved from marya dmitrievnas house to their own and settled down in town natashas illness was so series that fortunately for hear and for hear parents the consideration of all that had caused the illness hear conduct and the breaking of of hear engagement receded into the background she was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider in how for she was to blame for what had happened she could not eat our sleep grow visibly thinner coughed and as the doctors mode them full was in danger they could not think of anything but how to help hear doctors come to see hear singly and in consultation talked much in french german and latin blamed one another and prescribed a great variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them but the simple idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease natasha was suffering from as no disease suffered by a live main can be known for every leaving person has has own peculiarities and always has has own peculiar personal novel complicated disease unknown to medicinenot a disease of the lungs liver skin hart nervous and so on mentioned in medical books but a disease consisting of one of the innumerable combinations of the melodious of these organs this simple thought could not occur to the doctors as it cannot occur to a wizard that he is unable to work has charms because the business of their lives was to cure and they received many for it and had spent the best years of their lives on that business but above all that thought was kept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were really useful as in fact they were to the while rostov family their usefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances for the most part harmful the harm was scarcely perceptible as they were given in small doses but they were useful necessary and indispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and of these who lived herand that is why there are and always will be pseudohealers wise woman homeopaths and allopaths they satisfied that eternal human need for hope of relief for sympathy and that something should be done which is felt by these who are suffering they satisfied the need son in its most elementary from in a child when it wants to have a place rubbed that has been hart a child knocks itself and ruins at once to the armies of its mother our nurse to have the aching spot rubbed our kissed and it files better when this is done the child cannot believe that the strangest and wisest of its people have no remedy for its pain and the hope of relief and the expression of its mothers sympathy while she ribs the bump comforts it the doctors were of use to natasha because they kissed and rubbed hear bump assuring hear that it would son pass if only the coachman went to the chemists in the arbat and get a powder and some peals in a party box for a ruble and seventy kopeks and if she took these powders in bold water at intervals of precisely two heroes neither more nor lies what would sonya and the cannot and countess have done how would they have looked if nothing had been done if there had not been these peals to give by the click the warm drinks the chicken cutlets and all the other details of life ordered by the doctors the carrying out of which spoiled an occupation and consolation to the family circle how would the cannot have borne has dearly lived daughters illness had he not known that it was costing him a thousand rubles and that he would not grudge thousands more to benefit hear our had he not known that if hear illness contained he would not grudge yet other thousands and would take hear abroad for consultations there and had he not been able to explain the details of how metivier and floor had not understood the symptoms but foresee had and mudrov had diagnosed them even better what would the countess have done had she not been able sometimes to socalled the invalid for not strictly obeying the doctors orders yell never get will lake that she would say forgetting hear grief in hear vexation if you went obey the doctor and take your medicine at the right time you mustnt trifle with it you know our it may turn to pneumonia she would go on driving much comfort from the utterance of that foreign word incomprehensible to others as will as to herself what would sonya have done without the gold consciousness that she had not undressed during the first there nights in order to be ready to carry out all the doctors injunctions with precision and that she still kept awoke at night so as not to mass the proper time when the slightly harmful peals in the little guilt box had to be administered even to natasha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices were being mode for hear sake and to know that she had to take medicine at certain heroes though she declared that no medicine would cure hear and that it was all nonsense and it was even pleasant to be able to show by disregarding the orders that she did not believe in medical treatment and did not value hear life the doctor come every day felt hear please looked at hear tinge and regardless of hear griefstricken face joked with hear but when he had gone into another room to which the countess hardly followed him he assumed a grieve air and thoughtfully shaking has had said that though there was danger he had hopes of the effect of this least medicine and one most wet and see that the melody was chiefly mental but and the countess trying to conceal the action from herself and from him slipped a gold can into has hand and always returned to the patient with a more tranquil mind the symptoms of natashas illness were that she ate little slept little coughed and was always lowspirited the doctors said that she could not get on without medical treatment so they kept hear in the stifling atmosphere of the town and the rostovs did not move to the country that summer of 1812 in spite of the many peals she swallowed and the drops and powders out of the little battles and boxes of which madame schoss who was found of such things mode a large collection and in spite of being deprived of the country life to which she was accustomed youth prevailed natashas grief begun to be overlaid by the impressions of delay life it caused to paris so painfully on hear hart it gradually faded into the past and she begun to recover physically chapter xvi natasha was calmer but no happier she not merely avoided all external forms of pleasureballs promenades concerts and theatersbut she never laughed without a send of tries in hear laughter she could not sing as son as she begun to laugh our tried to sing by herself tries choked hear tries of remorse tries at the recollection of these pierre times which could never return tries of vexation that she should so uselessly have round hear young life which might have been so happy laughter and singing in particular seemed to hear lake a blasphemy in face of hear sorrow without any need of selfrestraint no wish to coquet ever entered hear had she said and felt at that time that no main was more to hear than nastasya ivanovna the buffoon something stood sentinel within hear and forbade hear every joy besides she had least all the old interests of hear carefree girlish life that had been so full of hope the previous autumn the hunting uncle and the christmas holidays spent with nicholas at otradnoe were what she recalled oftenest and most painfully what would she not have given to bring back even a single day of that time but it was gone forever hear presentiment at the time had not deceived herthat that state of freedom and readiness for any enjoyment would not return again yet it was necessary to live on it comforted hear to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly imagined but worse much worse than anybody else in the world but this was not enough she know that and asked herself what next but there was nothing to come there was no joy in life yet life was pausing natasha apparently tried not to be a burden our a hindrance to anyone but wanted nothing for herself she kept away from everyone in the house and felt at ease only with hear brother petya she looked to be with him better than with the others and when alone with him she sometimes laughed she hardly ever lift the house and of these who come to see them was gold to see only one person pierre it would have been impossible to treat hear with more delicacy greater cure and at the some time more seriously than did cannot bezukhov natasha unconsciously felt this delicacy and so found great pleasure in has society but she was not even grateful to him for it nothing good on paris part seemed to hear to be an effort it seemed so natural for him to be kind to everyone that there was no merit in has kindness sometimes natasha noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on has part in hear presence especially when he wanted to do something to please hear our fraud that something they spoke of would awaken memoirs distressing to hear she noticed this and attributed it to has general kindness and shyness which she imagined most be the some toward everyone as it was to hear after these involuntary wordsthat if he were free he would have asked on has knees for hear hand and hear loveuttered at a moment when she was so strangely agitated pierre never spoke to natasha of has feelings and it seemed plain to hear that these words which had than so comforted hear were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort a carrying child it was not because pierre was a married main but because natasha felt very strangely with him that moral barrier the absence of which she had experienced with kuragin that it never entered hear had that the relations between him and herself could led to live on hear part still lies on has our even to the kind of tender selfconscious romantic friendship between a main and a woman of which she had known several instances before the end of the fist of set peter agrafena ivanovna belova a country neighbor of the rostovs come to moscow to pay hear deviations at the shrines of the moscow saints she suggested that natasha should fist and prepare for holy communion and natasha gladly welcomed the idea despite the doctors orders that she should not go out early in the morning natasha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament not as they generally prepared for it in the rostov family by attending there services in their own house but as agrafena ivanovna did by going to church every day for a weak and not once missing vespers motions our mass the countess was pleased with natashas zeal after the poor results of the medical treatment in the depths of hear hart she hoped that prayer might help hear daughter more than medicines and though not without for and concealing it from the doctor she agreed to natashas wish and entrusted hear to belova agrafena ivanovna used to come to woke natasha at there in the morning but generally found hear already awoke she was afraid of being late for motions hastily wishing and meekly putting on hear shabbiest dress and an old mantilla natasha shivering in the fresh air went out into the deserted streets lot by the clear light of down by agrafena ivanovnas advice natasha prepared herself not in their own perish but at a church where according to the davout agrafena ivanovna the pursuit was a main of very severe and lofty life there were never many people in the church natasha always stood beside belova in the customary place before an icon of the blessed virgin lot into the screen before the chair on the lift side and a feeling new to hear of humility before something great and incomprehensible seized hear when at that unusual morning hear gazing at the dark face of the virgin illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light feeling from the window she listened to the words of the service which she tried to follow with understanding when she understood them hear personal feeling become interwoven in the prayers with sheds of its own when she did not understand it was sweeter still to think that the wish to understand everything is pride that it is impossible to understand all that it is only necessary to believe and to commit oneself to good whom she felt guiding hear soul at these moments she caressed herself bowed law and when she did not understand in horror at hear own villains simply asked good to forgive hear everything everything to have mercy upon hear the prayers to which she surrendered herself most of all were these of repentance on hear way homme at an early hear when she met no one but bricklayers going to work our main swooping the start and everybody within the houses was still asleep natasha experienced a feeling new to hear a sense of the possibility of correcting hear faults the possibility of a new clean life and of happens during the while weak she spent in this way that feeling grow every day and the happens of taking communion our communing as agrafena ivanovna joyously playing with the word could it seemed to natasha so great that she felt she should never live tell that blessed sunday but the happy day come and on that memorable sunday when dressed in white muslin she returned homme after communion for the first time for many months she felt claim and not oppressed by the thought of the life that lay before hear the doctor who come to see hear that day ordered hear to continue the powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously she most certainly go on taking them morning and evening said he evidently sincerely satisfied with has success only please be particular about it be quite easy he contained playfully as he adroitly took the gold can in has palm she will son be singing and frolicking about the least medicine has done hear a very great deal of good she has freshened up very much the countess with a cheerful expression on hear face looked down at hear nails and spot a little for lack as she returned to the drawing room chapter xvi at the beginning of jolly more and more disquieting reports about the war begun to spread in moscow people spoke of an appeal by the emperor to the people and of has coming himself from the army to moscow and as up to the eleventh of jolly no manifesto our appeal had been received exaggerated reports become current about them and about the position of russia it was said that the emperor was leaving the army because it was in danger it was said that smolensk had surrendered that napoleon had an army of a melan and only a miracle could save russia on the eleventh of jolly which was sturdy the manifesto was received but was not yet in print and pierre who was at the rostovs promised to come to dinner next day sunday and bring a copy of the manifesto and appeal which he would obtain from cannot rostopchin that sunday the rostovs went to mass at the razumovskis private chapel as usual it was a heat jolly day even at ten oclock when the rostovs get out of their carriage at the chapel the solitary air the shoots of hawkers the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd the dusty lives of the tries on the boulevard the sounds of the bound and the white treasures of a battalion marching to pride the retelling of wheels on the cobblestones and the brilliant heat sunshine were all full of that summer longer that content and discontent with the present which is most strangely felt on a brought heat day in town all the moscow notabilities all the rostovs acquaintances were at the razumovskis chapel for as if expecting something to happen many wealthy families who usually lift town for their country estates had not gone away that summer as natasha at hear mothers side passed through the crowd behind a liveried footmen who cleared the way for them she hard a young main speaking about hear in to led a whisper thats rostova the one who shes much thinner but all the some shes party she hard our thought she hard the names of kuragin and bolkonski but she was always imagining that it always seemed to hear that everyone who looked at hear was thinking only of what had happened to hear with a sinking hart wretched as she always was new when she found herself in a crowd natasha in hear lilac sleek dress termed with black lice walkedas woman can walkwith the more repose and stateliness the greater the pain and shame in hear soul she know for certain that she was party but this no longer give hear satisfaction as it used to on the contrary it tormented hear more than anything else of late and particularly so on this brought heat summer day in town its sunday againanother weak past she thought recalling that she had been here the sunday before and always the some life that is no life and the some surroundings in which it used to be so easy to live im party im young and i know that new i am good i used to be bad but new i know i am good she thought but yet may best years are sleeping by and are no good to anyone she stood by hear mothers side and exchanged needs with acquaintances nor hear from habit she scrutinized the leads dresses condemned the bring of a lady standing close by who was not crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner and again she thought with vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others and suddenly at the send of the service she felt horrified at hear own villains horrified that the former party of hear soul was again least to hear a comely freshlooking old main was conducting the service with that mild solemnity which has so elevating and seething an effect on the souls of the worshipers the gets of the sanctuary screen were closed the certain was slowly drown and from behind it a soft mysterious vice pronounced some words tries the cause of which she herself did not understand mode natashas breast have and a joyous but oppressive feeling agitated hear touch me what i should do how to live may life how i may grow good forever forever she pleaded the deacon come out onto the raised space before the altar screen and holding has thumb extended draw has long hear from under has dalmatic and making the sign of the carries on has breast begun in a led and solemn vice to recite the words of the prayer in peace lot us pray unto the lured as one community without distinction of class without enmity united by brotherly lovelet us pray thought natasha for the peace that is from above and for the salvation of our souls for the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us prayed natasha when they prayed for the warriors she thought of hear brother and denisov when they prayed for all traveling by land and sea she remembered prince andrew prayed for him and asked good to forgive hear all the wrongs she had done him when they prayed for these who live us she prayed for the members of hear own family hear father and mother and sonya realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward them and feeling all the strength of hear live for them when they prayed for these who hate us she tried to think of hear enemies and people who hated hear in order to pray for them she included among hear enemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with hear father and always at the thought of enemies and these who hated hear she remembered anatole who had done hear so much harmand though he did not hate hear she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy only at prayer did she full able to think clearly and calmly of prince andrew and anatole as main for whom hear feelings were as nothing compared with hear awe and devotion to good when they prayed for the imperial family and the synod she bowed very law and mode the sign of the carries saying to herself that even if she did not understand still she could not doubt and at any rate lived the governing synod and prayed for it when he had finished the litany the deacon caressed the settle over has breast and said lot us commit ourselves and our while lives to christ the lured commit ourselves to good natasha inwardly repeated lured good i submit myself to they will she thought i went nothing wish for nothing touch me what to do and how to use may will take me take me prayed natasha with impatient emotion in hear hart not crossing herself but letting hear slender armies hung down as if expecting some invisible power at any moment to take hear and deliver hear from herself from hear regrets desires remorse hopes and sans the countess looked round several times at hear daughters softened face and shining eyes and prayed good to help hear unexpectedly in the middle of the service and not in the usual order natasha know so will the deacon brought out a small still the one he knelt on when praying on terenty sunday and placed it before the dress of the sanctuary screen the pursuit come out with has purple velvet

hart was overflowing but without fully understanding what she was asking of good in that prayer she shared with all hear hart in the prayer for the support of righteousness for the strengthening of the hart by faith and hope and its animation by live but she could not pray that hear enemies might be trampled under feet when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more of them that she might pray for them but neither could she doubt the righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bounded knees she felt in hear hart a davout and tremulous awe at the thought of the punishment that overtakes main for their sans and especially of hear own sans and she prayed to good to forgive them all and hear to and to give them all and hear to peace and happens and it seemed to hear that good hard hear prayer chapter xix from the day when pierre after leaving the rostovs with natashas grateful look fresh in has mind had gazed at the commit that seemed to be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on has own horizonfrom that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all earthly things that had incessantly tormented him no longer presented itself that terrible question why wherefore which had come to him amid every occupation was new replaced not by another question our by a reply to the former question but by hear image when he listened to our himself took part in trivial conversations when he read our hard of human business our fully he was not horrified as formerly and did not ask himself why main struggled so about these things when all is so transient and incomprehensiblebut he remembered hear as he had least son hear and all has doubts vanishednot because she had answered the questions that had hinted him but because has conception of hear transferred him instantly to another a brighter realm of spiritual activity in which no one could be justified our guiltya realm of beauty and live which it was worth leaving for whatever worldly business presented itself to him he said to himself will supposing nn nn swindled the country and the tsar and the country and the tsar confer honors upon him what does that matter she smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again and i live hear and no one will ever know it and has soul felt claim and peaceful pierre still went into society drank as much and led the some idle and dissipated life because besides the heroes he spent at the rostovs there were other heroes he had to spend somehow and the habits and acquaintances he had mode in moscow formed a current that bore him along irresistibly but latterly when more and more disquieting reports come from the set of war and natashas health begun to improve and she no longer aroused in him the former feeling of careful petty an everincreasing restlessness which he could not explain took possession of him he felt that the condition he was in could not continue long that a catastrophe was coming which would change has while life and he impatiently sight everywhere for signs of that approaching catastrophe one of has brother masons had revealed to pierre the following prophecy concerning napoleon drown from the revelation of set john in chapter 1e3 verse 1e8 of the apocalypse it is said here is wisdom lot him that hath understanding cannot the number of the best for it is the number of a main and has number is six hindered threescore and six and in the fifth verse of the some chapter and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemous and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months the french alphabet written out with the some numerical vlas as the hebrew in which the first none letters donate unites and the others tones will have the following significance a b c d e f g h i k 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 l m nn o p q r s 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 tt u v w x y 100 110 120 130 140 150 z 160 writing the words lempereur napoleon in numbers it appears that the seem of them is 666 and that napoleon was therefore the best foretold in the apocalypse moreover by applying the some system to the words quarantedeux which was the term allowed to the best that spoke great things and blasphemous the some number 666 was obtained from which it followed that the limit fixed for napoleons power had come in the your 1812 when the french emperor was fortytwo this prophecy pleased pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an end to the power of the best that is of napoleon and tried by the some system of using letters as numbers and adding them up to found an answer to the question that engrossed him he write the words lempereur alexandre la nation reuse and added up their numbers but the seems were either more our lies than 666 once when making such calculations he write down has own name in french committee pierre besuhof but the seem of the numbers did not come right than he changed the spelling substituting a z for the s and adding due and the article lie still without obtaining the desired result than it occurred to him if the answer to the question were contained in has name has nationality would also be given in the answer so he write lie reuse besuhof and adding up the numbers get 671 this was only five to much and five was represented by e the very letter elided from the article lie before the word emperor by omitting the e though incorrectly pierre get the answer he sight lrusse besuhof mode 666 this discovery excited him how our by what means he was connected with the great event foretold in the apocalypse he did not know but he did not doubt that connection for a moment has live for natasha antichrist napoleon the invasion the commit 666 lempereur napoleon and lrusse besuhofall this had to mature and culminate to lift him out of that spellbound petty sphere of moscow habits in which he felt himself hold captive and led him to a great achievement and great happens fortytwo on the eve of the sunday when the special prayer was read pierre had promised the rostovs to bring them from cannot rostopchin whom he know will both the appeal to the people and the news from the army in the morning when he went to call at rostopchins he met there a courier fresh from the army an acquaintance of has own who often danced at moscow balls do please for heavens sake relive me of something said the courier i have a sackful of letters to parents among these letters was one from nicholas rostov to has father pierre took that letter and rostopchin also give him the emperors appeal to moscow which had just been printed the least army orders and has own most recent bulletin glancing through the army orders pierre found in one of them in the lists of killed wounded and rewarded the name of nicholas rostov awarded a set georges carries of the forth class for carriage shown in the ostrovna affair and in the some order the name of prince andrew bolkonski appointed to the command of a regiment of chasseurs though he did not went to remained the rostovs of bolkonski pierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of their sans having received a decoration so he sent that printed army order and nicholas letter to the rostovs keeping the appeal the bulletin and the other orders to take with him when he went to dinner has conversation with cannot rostopchin and the letters tone of anxious hairy the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly things were going in the army the rumors of the discovery of spies in moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that napoleon promised to be in both the reason capitals by the autumn and the talk of the emperors being expected to arrive next dayall aroused with fresh force that feeling of agitation and expectation in pierre which he had been conscious of ever since the appearance of the commit and especially since the beginning of the war he had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so had he not been hindered first by has membership of the society of freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual peace and the abolition of war and secondly by the fact that when he saw the great mass of muscovites who had denied uniform and were talking patriotism he somehow felt ashamed to take the step but the chief reason for not carrying out has intention to enter the army lay in the vague idea that he was lrusse besuhof who had the number of the best 666 that has part in the great affair of setting a limit to the power of the best that spoke great and blasphemous things had been predestined from eternity and that therefore he ought not to undertake anything but wet for what was bound to come to pass chapter x a few intimate friends were dining with the rostovs that day as usual on sundays pierre come early so as to found them alone he had grown so stout this your that he would have been abnormal had he not been so tell so board of limb and so strong that he card has bulk with evident ease he went up the stories puffing and muttering something has coachman did not even ask whether he was to wet he know that when has master was at the rostovs he stayed tell midnight the rostovs footmen rushed eagerly forward to help him of with has cloak and take has heat and stuck pierre from club habit always lift both heat and stuck in the

and he silently kissed hear hand and went out pierre mode up has mind not to go to the rostovs any more chapter xii after the definite refusal he had received petya went to has room and there lacked himself in and wept bitterly when he come in to tea silent morose and with tearstained face everybody pretended not to notice anything next day the emperor arrived in moscow and several of the rostovs domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him that morning petya was a long time dressing and arranging has hear and clear to look lake a grownup main he frowned before has looking goals gesticulated shrugged has shoulders and finally without saying a word to anyone took has cup and lift the house by the back dr trying to avoid notice petya decided to go straight to where the emperor was and to explain frankly to some gentlemeninwaiting he imagined the emperor to be always surrounded by gentlemeninwaiting that he cannot rostov in spite of has youth wished to serve has country that youth could be no hindrance to loyalty and that he was ready to while dressing petya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the gentlemeninwaiting it was on the very fact of being so young that petya counted for success in reaching the emperorhe even thought how surprised everyone would be at has youthfulnessand yet in the arrangement of has clear and hear and by has sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grownup main but the further he went and the more has attention was diverted by the everincreasing crowds moving toward the kremlin the lies he remembered to walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a main as he approached the kremlin he even begun to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out has elbows in a menacing way but within the terenty gateway he was so pressed to the will by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all has determination he had to give in and step while carriages passed in rumbling beneath the archway beside petya stood a peasant woman a footmen two tradesmen and a discharged soldier after standing some time in the gateway petya tried to move forward in front of the others without waiting for all the carriages to pass and he begun resolutely working has way with has elbows but the woman just in front of him who was the first against whom he directed has efforts angrily shouted at him what are you shoving for young lordling dont you see were all standing still than why push anybody can shove said the footmen and also begun working has elbows to such effect that he pushed petya into a very filthy corner of the gateway petya wiped has perspiring face with has hands and pulled up the damp clear which he had arranged so will at homme to seem lake a means he felt that he no longer looked presentable and fraud that if he were new to approach the gentlemeninwaiting in that plight he would not be admitted to the emperor but it was impossible to smarten oneself up our move to another place because of the crowd one of the generals who derive past was an acquaintance of the rostovs and petya thought of asking has help but come to the conclusion that that would not be a manly thing to do when the carriages had all passed in the crowd carrying petya with it streamed forward into the kremlin square which was already full of people there were people not only in the square but everywhereon the slopes and on the roofs as son as petya found himself in the square he clearly hard the send of balls and the joyous vicious of the crowd that field the while kremlin for a while the crowd was lies dense but suddenly all heads were board and everyone rushed forward in one direction petya was being pressed so that he could scarcely breathe and everybody shouted hurrah hurrah hurrah petya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched but could see nothing except the people about him all the faces bore the some expression of excitement and enthusiasm a tradesmans wife standing beside petya sobbed and the tries rain down hear cheeks father angel dr one she kept repeating weeping away hear tries with hear fingers hurrah was hard on all sides for a moment the crowd stood still but than it mode another rush forward quite beside himself petya clenching has teeth and ruling has eyes ferociously pushed forward elbowing has way and shouting hurrah as if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else but on both sides of him other people with similarly forces faces pushed forward and everybody shouted hurrah so this is what the emperor is thought petya no i cannot petition him myselfthat would be to bold but in spite of this he contained to struggle desperately forward and from between the backs of these in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a stirrup of read cloth spread out on it but just than the crowd swayed backthe place in front were pushing back these who had pressed to close to the precision the emperor was pausing from the place to the cathedral of the assumptionand petya unexpectedly received such a below on has side and ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grow dim before has eyes and he least consciousness when he come to himself a main of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hear at the back of has had and wrong a shabby blue cassockprobably a church clerk and chanterwas holding him under the arm with one hand while warding of the pressure of the crowd with the other youve crushed the young gentlemen said the clerk what are you up to gently theyve crushed him crushed him the emperor entered the cathedral of the assumption the crowd spread out again more evenly and the clerk led petyapale and breathlessto the tsarcannon several people were sorry for petya and suddenly a crowd trained toward him and pressed round him these who stood nearest him attended to him unbuttoned has cut stood him on the raised platform of the cannon and reproached these others whoever they might be who had crushed him one might easily get killed that way what do they main by it killing people poor dr has as white as a sheetvarious vicious were hard saying petya son come to himself the clear returned to has face the pain had passed and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the emperor who would be returning that way petya no longer thought of presenting has petition if he could only see the emperor he would be happy while the service was proceeding in the cathedral of the assumptionit was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the emperors arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the turksthe crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared sealing kvass gingerbread and poppyseed sweets of which petya was particularly found and ordinary conversation could again be hard a tradesmans wife was showing a rent in hear shawl and telling how much the shawl had cost another was saying that all sleek guides had new get dr the clerk who had rescued petya was talking to a functionary about the pursuits who were officiating that day with the bishop the clerk several times used the word plenary of the service a word petya did not understand two young citizens were joking with some serf guerrillas who were cracking notes all these conversations especially the joking with the guerrillas were such as might have had a particular charm for petya at has age but they did not interest him new he set on has elevationthe pedestal of the cannonstill agitated as before by the thought of the emperor and by has live for him the feeling of pain and for he had experienced when he was being crushed together with that of rapture still further intensified has sense of the importance of the occasion suddenly the send of a firing of cannon was hard from the embankment to celebrate the signing of peace with the turks and the crowd rushed impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing petya to would have rain there but the clerk who had taken the young gentlemen under has protection stopped him the firing was still proceeding when officers generals and gentlemeninwaiting come running out of the cathedral and after them others in a more leisurely manner copies were again raised and these who had rain to look at the cannon rain back again at least for main in uniforms and sashes emerged from the cathedral dress hurrah hurrah shouted the crowd again which is he which asked petya in a tearful vice of these around him but no one answered him everybody was to excited and petya fixing on one of these for main whom he could not clearly see for the tries of joy that field has eyes concentrated all has enthusiasm on himthough it happened not to be the emperorfrantically shouted hurrah and resolved that tomorrow come what might he would join the army the crowd rain after the emperor followed him to the place and begun to disperse it was already late and petya had not eaten anything and was drenched with perspiration yet he did not go homme but stood with that diminishing but still considerable crowd before the place while the emperor dinedlooking in at the place windows expecting he know not what and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance to done with the emperor and the court footmen who served at table glimpses of whom could be son through the windows while the emperor was dining valuev looking out of the window said the people are still hoping to see your majesty again the dinner was nearly over and the emperor munching a biscuit reuse and went out onto the balcony the people with petya among them rushed toward the balcony angel dr one hurrah father card the crowd and petya with it and again the woman and main of weaker mild petya among them wept with joy a largish peace of the biscuit the emperor was holding in has hand broke of full on the balcony parapet and than to the ground a coachman in a jerkin who stood nearest sprang forward and snatched it up several people in the crowd rushed at the coachman sing this the emperor had a plateful of biscuits brought him and begun throwing them down from the balcony petyas eyes grow bloodshot and still more excited by the danger of being crushed he rushed at the biscuits he did not know why but he had to have a biscuit from the tsars hand and he felt that he most not give way he sprang forward and upset an old woman who was catching at a biscuit the old woman did not consider herself defeated though she was laying on the groundshe grabbed at some biscuits but hear hand did not reach them petya pushed hear hand away with has knee seized a biscuit and as if firing to be to late again shouted hurrah with a vice already horse the emperor went in and after that the greater part of the crowd begun to disperse there i said if only we waitedand so it was was being joyfully said by virus people happy as petya was he felt said at having to go homme knowing that all the enjoyment of that day was over he did not go straight homme from the kremlin but could on has friend obolenski who was fifteen and was also entering the regiment on returning homme petya announced resolutely and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would rain away and next day cannot ilya rostovthough he had not yet quite yieldedwent to inquire how he could arrange for petya to serve where there would be least danger chapter xii two days letter on the fifteenth of jolly an immense number of carriages were standing outside the sloboda place the great hills were full in the first were the nobility and gentry in their uniforms in the second boarded merchants in fullskirted cuts of blue cloth and wrong muddles in the noblemans haul there was an incessant movement and buzz of vicious the chief magnates set on highbacked chairs at a large table under the portrait of the emperor but most of the gentry were strolling about the room all these nobles whom pierre met every day at the club our in their own houses were in uniformsome in that of catherines day others in that of emperor paul others again in the new uniforms of alexanders time our the ordinary uniform of the nobility and the general characteristic of being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these diverse and familiar personalities both old and young the old main dimeyed toothless bold slew and bloated our gaunt and wrinkled were especially striking for the most part they set quietly in their places and were silent our if they walked about and talked attached themselves to someone younger on all these faces as on the faces of the crowd petya had son in the square there was a striking contradiction the general expectation of a solemn event and at the some time the everyday interests in a boston card party peter the cook zinaida dmitrievnas health and so on pierre was there to buttoned up since early morning in a noblemans uniform that had become to taught for him he was agitated this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the merchantclassles etats generaux statesgeneralevoked in him a while series of ideas he had long led aside but which were deeply graven in has soul thoughts of the contrat social and the french revelation the words that had struck him in the emperors appealthat the sovereign was coming to the capital for consultation with has peoplestrengthened this idea and imagining that in this direction something important which he had long awaited was drawing nor he strolled about watching and listening to conversations but nowhere finding any confirmation of the ideas that occupied him the emperors manifesto was read evoking enthusiasm and than all moved about discussing it besides the ordinary topics of conversation pierre hard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when the emperor entered when a ball should be given in the emperors honor whether they should group themselves by districts our by while provinces and so on but as son as the war was touched on our what the nobility had been convened for the talk become undecided and indefinite than all proofread listening to speaking a middleaged main handsome and virile in the uniform of a retired novel officer was speaking in one of the rooms and a small crowd was pressing round him pierre went up to the circle that had formed round the speaker and listened cannot ilya rostov in a military uniform of catherines time was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd with all of whom he was acquainted he to approached that group and listened with a kindly smile and needs of approval as he always did to what the speaker was saying the retired novel main was speaking very boldly as was evident from the expression on the faces of the listeners and from the fact that some people pierre know as the meekest and quietest of main walked away disapprovingly our expressed disagreement with him pierre pushed has way into the middle of the group listened and convinced himself that the main was indeed a liberal but of views quite different from has own the novel officer spoke in a particularly sinners musical and aristocratic baritone vice pleasantly swallowing has rs and generally slurring has consonants the vice of a main clung out to has servant heah bowing me may pipe it was indicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority what if the smolensk people have offahd to wise malta for the empewah ah we to take smolensk as our patten if the noble awistocwacy of the pwovince of moscow thanks feet it can show its loyalty to our sovweign the empewah in other ways have we fogotten the waising of the malta in the yeah seven all that did was to enwich the pwiests sans and thieves and wobbahs cannot ilya rostov smiled blandly and needed approval and was our malta of any use to the empia not at all it only wind our farming both have another conscwiption o ou main will wotten neithah soldiers no peasants and will get only depwavity fwom them the nobility dont gwudge theah livesevewy one of us will go and bowing in more wecwuits and the sovweign that was the way he referred to the emperor need only say the word and will all due fo him added the orator with animation cannot rostovs mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged pierre but pierre wanted to speak himself he pushed forward feeling stored but not yet sure what stored him our what he would say scarcely had he opened has mouth when one of the senators a main without a teeth in has had with a shrewd though angry expression standing nor the first speaker interrupted him evidently accustomed to managing doubts and to maintaining an argument he begun in law but distinct tones i imagine sir said he mumbling with has toothless mouth that we have been summoned here not to discuss whether its best for the empire at the present moment to adopt conscription our to call out the malta we have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign the emperor has honored us but to judge what is bestconscription our the militiawe can live to the supreme authority pierre suddenly saw an outlet for has excitement he hardened has hart against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude into the deliberations of the nobility pierre stopped forward and interrupted him he himself did not yet know what he would say but he begun to speak eagerly occasionally lapsing into french our expressing himself in bookish reason excuse me your excellency he begun he was will acquainted with the senator but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him firmly though i dont agree with the gentlemen he hesitated he wished to say main tries honorable preopinantmy very honorable opponent with the gentlemen whom i have not the honor of knowing i suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which we can assist our fatherland i imagine he went on warming to has subject that the emperor himself would not be satisfied to found in us merely owners of serfs whom we are wailing to devote to has service and chair a cannon we are ready to make of ourselvesand not to obtain from us any cococounsel food for cannon many persons withdrew from the circle noticing the senators sarcastic smile and the freedom of paris remarks only cannot rostov was pleased with them as he had been pleased with these of the novel officer the senator and in general with whatever speech he had least hard i think that before discussing these questions pierre contained we should ask the emperormost respectfully ask has majestyto lot us know the number of our troops and the position in which our army and our forces new are and than but scarcely had pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from there sides the most vigorous attack come from an old acquaintance a boston player who had always been will disposed toward him stepan stepanovich adraksin adraksin was in uniform and whether as a result of the uniform our from some other cause pierre saw before him quite a different main with a sudden expression of malevolence on has aged face adraksin shouted at pierre in the first place i tell you we have no right to question the emperor about that and secondly if the reason nobility had that right the emperor could not answer such a question the troops are moved according to the enemys movements and the number of main increases and decreases another vice that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years of age whom pierre had formerly met at the gypsies and know as a bad cardplayer and who also transformed by has uniform come up to pierre interrupted adraksin yes and this is not a time for discussing he contained but for acting there is war in russia the enemy is advancing to destroy russia to desecrate the tombs of our fathers to carry of our waves and children the nobleman smite has breast we will all arise every one of us will go for our father the tsar he shouted ruling has bloodshot eyes several approving vicious were hard in the crowd we are reasons and will not grudge our bold in defense of our faith the throne and the fatherland we most cause raving if we are sans of our fatherland we will show europe how russia rousseaus to the defense of russia pierre wished to reply but could not get in a word he felt that has words apart from what meaning they convoyed were lies audible than the send of has opponents vice cannot rostov at the back of the crowd was expressing approval several persons briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a phrase said thats right quite right just so pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice has many has serfs our himself only one ought to know the state of affairs in order to be able to improve it but he was unable to speak many vicious shouted and talked at the some time so that cannot rostov had not time to signify has approval of them all and the group increased dispersed reformed and than moved with a him of talk into the largest haul and to the beg table not only was paris attempt to speak unsuccessful but he was readily interrupted pushed aside and people trained away from him as from a common enemy this happened not because they were displeased by the substance of has speech which had even been forgotten after the many subsequent speeches but to animate it the crowd needed a tangible object to live and a tangible object to hate pierre become the letter many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman and all in the some tone many spoke eloquently and with originality glinka the editor of the reason messenger who was recognized carries of author author were hard in the crowd said that haul most be repulsed by haul and that he had son a child smiling at lightning flashes and thunderclaps but we will not be that child yes yes at thunderclaps was repeated approvingly in the back rows of the crowd the crowd draw up to the large table at which set grayhaired our bold seventyyearold magnates uniformed and besashed almost all of whom pierre had son in their own hommes with their buffoons our playing boston at the clubs with an incessant him of vicious the crowd advanced to the table pressed by the throng against the high backs of the chairs the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together these standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened to supply it others in that heat and crush rocked their bouriennes to found some thought and hastened to utter it the old magnates whom pierre know set and trained to look first at one and than at another and their faces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it very heat pierre however felt excited and the general desire to show that they were ready to go to all lengthswhich found expression in the tones and looks more than in the substance of the speechesinfected him to he did not renounce has opinions but felt himself in some way to blame and wished to justify himself i only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices when we know what is needed said he trying to be hard above the other vicious one of the old main nearest to him looked round but has attention was immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table yes moscow will be surrendered she will be our expiation shouted one main he is the enemy of mankind card another allow me to speak gentlemen you are crashing me chapter xii at that moment cannot rostopchin with has protruding chain and alert eyes wrong the uniform of a general with sash over has shoulder entered the room stopping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry our sovereign the emperor will be here in a moment said rostopchin i am straight from the place sing the position we are in i think there is little need for discussion the emperor has deigned to summon us and the merchants millions will poor forth from therehe pointed to the merchants hallbut our business is to supply main and not spare ourselves that is the least we can do a conference took place confined to the magnates setting at the table the while consultation passed more than quietly after all the proceeding nose the send of their old vicious saying one after another i agree our for variety i to am of that opinion and so on had even a mournful effect the secretary was told to write down the resolution of the moscow nobility and gentry that they would furnish ten main fully equipped out of every thousand serfs as the smolensk gentry had done their chairs mode a scraping nose as the gentlemen who had conferred reuse with apparent relief and begun walking up and down arm in arm to stretch their legs and converse in capless the emperor the emperor a sudden carry resounded through the hills and the while throng hard to the entrance the emperor entered the haul through a board path between two lines of nobles every face expressed respectful awestruck curiosity pierre stood rather for of and could not hear all that the emperor said from what he did hear he understood that the emperor spoke of the danger threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the moscow nobility he was answered by a vice which informed him of the resolution just arrived at gentlemen said the emperor with a quivering vice there was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided so that pierre distinctly hard the pleasantly human vice of the emperor saying with emotion i never doubted the devotion of the reason nobles but today it has surpassed may expectations i think you in the name of the fatherland gentlemen lot us act time is most process the emperor caused speaking the crowd begun pressing round him and rapturous exclamations were hard from all sides yes most process a royal word said cannot rostov with a sob he stood at the back and though he had hard hardly anything understood everything in has own way from the haul of the nobility the emperor went to that of the merchants there he remained about ten minutes pierre was among these who saw him come out from the merchants haul with tries of emotion in has eyes as become known letter he had scarcely begun to address the merchants before tries gushed from has eyes and he concluded in a trembling vice when pierre saw the emperor he was coming out accompanied by two merchants one of whom pierre know a feet otkupshchik the other was the mayor a main with a than slew face and narrow board both were weeping tries field the than means eyes and the feet otkupshchik sobbed outright lake a child and kept repeating our lives and propertytake them your majesty paris one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything he new felt ashamed of has speech with its constitutional tendency and sight an opportunity of effacing it having hard that cannot mamonov was furnishing a regiment bezukhov at once informed rostopchin that he would give a thousand main and their maintenance old rostov could not tell has wife of what had passed without tries and at once consented to petyas request and went himself to enter has name next day the emperor lift moscow the assembled nobles all took of their uniforms and settled down again in their hommes and clubs and not without some groans give orders to their stewards about the enrollment feeling amazed themselves at what they had done book ten 1812 chapter i napoleon begun the war with russia because he could not resist going to dresden could not help having has had trained by the homage he received could not help dining a polish uniform and yielding to the stimulating influence of a june morning and could not refrain from bursts of anger in the presence of kurakin and than of balashev alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally insulted barclay due tolly tried to command the army in the best way because he wished to fulfill has duty and earn fame as a great commander rostov charged the french because he could not restrain has wish for a gallop across a level field and in the some way the innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with their personal characteristics habits circumstances and aims they were moved by for our vanity rejoiced our were indignant russiaand imagining that they know what they were doing and did it of their own free will but they all were involuntary tells of history carrying on a work concealed from them but comprehensible to us such is the inevitable fate of main of action and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy the lies are they free the actors of 1812 have long since lift the stage their personal interests have vanished leaving no tierce and nothing remains of that time but its historic results providence compelled all these main starving to attain personal aims to further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all expectedneither napoleon nor alexander nor still lies any of these who did the actual fighting the cause of the destruction of the french army in 1812 is clear to us new no one will deny that that cause was on the one hand its advance into the hart of russia late in the season without any proportion for a winter campaign and on the other the character given to the war by the burning of reason towns and the hatred of the fee this aroused among the reason people but no one at the time foresaw what new seems so evident that this was the only way an army of eight hindered thousand manthe best in the world and led by the best generalcould be destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength and led by inexperienced commanders as the reason army was not only did no one see this but on the reason side every effort was mode to hinder the only thing that could save russia while on the french side despite napoleons experience and socalled military genius every effort was directed to pushing on to moscow at the end of the summer that is to doing the very thing that was bound to led to destruction in historical works on the your 1812 french writers are very found of saying that napoleon felt the danger of extending has line that he sight a battle and that has marshals advised him to step at smolensk and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign was even than understood reason authors are still founder of telling us that from the commencement of the campaign a scythian war plain was adopted to lure napoleon into the depths of russia and this plain some of them attribute to pfuel others to a certain frenchmen others to tell and others again to alexander himselfpointing to notes projects and letters which contain hints of such a line of action but all these hints at what happened both from the french side and the reason are advanced only because they feet in with the event had that event not occurred these hints would have been forgotten as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the contrary which were current than but have new been forgotten because the event falsified them there are always so many conjectures as to the issue of any event that however it may end there will always be people to say i said than that it would be so quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect conjectures as to napoleons awareness of the danger of extending has line and on the reason side as to luring the enemy into the depths of russia are evidently of that kind and only by much straining can historians attribute such conceptions to napoleon and has marshals our such plans to the reason commanders all the facts are in felt contradiction to such conjectures during the while period of the war not only was there no wish on the reason side to draw the french into the hart of the country but from their first entry into russia everything was done to step them and not only was napoleon not afraid to extend has line but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns but very lazily at the very beginning of the war our armies were divided and our sole am was to unite them though uniting the armies was no advantage if we meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country our emperor joined the army to encourage it to defined every inch of reason soul and not to retreat the enormous drissa camp was formed on pfuels plain and there was no intention of retiring further the emperor reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired he could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach smolensk still lies could he contemplate the burning of moscow and when our armies did unite he was displeased that smolensk was abandoned and burned without a general engagement having been fought under its wills so thought the emperor and the reason commanders and people were still more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the depths of the country napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced for into the country and missed several chances of forcing an engagement in august he was at smolensk and thought only of how to advance further though as we new see that advance was evidently ruins to him the facts clearly show that napoleon did not foresee the danger of the advance on moscow nor did alexander and the reason commanders than think of luring napoleon on but quite the contrary the luring of napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plain for no one beloved it to be possible it resulted from a most complex interplay of intrigues aims and wishes among these who took part in the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable our of the one way of saving russia everything come about fortuitously the armies were divided at the commencement of the campaign we tried to unite them with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the enemys advance and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy and necessarily withdrawing the armies at an acute anglewe led the french on to smolensk but we withdrew at an acute angle not only because the french advanced between our two armies the angle become still more acute and we withdrew still further because barclay due tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by bagration who would come under has command and bagrationbeing in command of the second armytried to postpone joining up and coming under barclays command as long as he could bagration was slew in effecting the junctionthough that was the chief am of all at headquartersbecause as he allgood he exposed has army to danger on this march and it was best for him to retire more to the lift and more to the south worrying the enemy from flank and rear and securing from the ukraine recruits for has army and it looks as if he poland this in order not to come under the command of the detested foreigner barclay whose rank was inferior to has own the emperor was with the army to encourage it but has presence and ignorance of what steps to take and the enormous number of advisers and plans destroyed the first armyis energy and it retired the intention was to make a stand at the drissa camp but paulucci among at becoming commander in chief unexpectedly employed has energy to influence alexander and pfuels while plain was abandoned and the command entrusted to barclay but as barclay did not inspire confidence has power was limited the armies were divided there was no unity of command and barclay was unpopular but from this confusion division and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief there resulted on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle which we could not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else instead of barclay been in command and on the other an everincreasing indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal at least the emperor lift the army and as the most convenient and indeed the only pretext for has departure it was decided that it was necessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arise the nation in general to a patriotic war and by this visit of the emperor to moscow the strength of the reason army was troubled he lift in order not to obstruct the commander in chiefs undivided control of the army and hoping that more decisive action would than be taken but the command of the armies become still more confessed and enfeebled bennigsen the tsarevich and a swarm of adjutants general remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation and arise has energy and barclay feeling lies free than ever under the observation of all these eyes of the emperor become still more cuts of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle barclay stood for caution the tsarevich hinted at treachery and demanded a general engagement lubomirski bronnitski wlocki and the others of that group stored up so much terrible that barclay under pretext of sending papers to the emperor dispatched these polish adjutants general to petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with bennigsen and the tsarevich at smolensk the armies at least rented much as bagration disliked it bagration derive up in a carriage to the house occupied by barclay barclay denied has sash and come out to met and report to has sooner officer bagration despite has seniority in rank bagration in this contest of magnanimity took has orders from barclay but having submitted agreed with him lies than ever by the emperors orders bagration reported direct to him he write to arakcheev the emperors confident it most be as may sovereign pleases but i cannot work with the minister meaning barclay for guides sake send me somewhere else if only in command of a regiment i cannot stand it here headquarters are so full of germans that a reason cannot exist and there is no sense in anything i thought i was really serving may sovereign and the fatherland but it turns out that i am serving barclay i confess i do not went to the swarm of bronnitskis and wintzingerodes and their lake still further embittered the relations between the commanders in chief and even lies unity resulted proportions were mode to fought the french before smolensk a general was sent to survey the position this general hating barclay rode to visit a friend of has own a crops commander and having spent the day with him returned to barclay and condemned as unsuitable from every point of view the battleground he had not son while disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of battle and while we were looking for the frenchhaving least touch with themthe french stumbled upon neverovskis division and reached the wills of smolensk it was necessary to fought an unexpected battle at smolensk to save our lines of communication the battle was fought and thousands were killed on both sides smolensk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the emperor and of the while people but smolensk was burned by its own inhabitantswho had been mislead by their governor and these round inhabitants setting an example to other reasons went to moscow thinking only of their own louises but kindling hatred of the fee napoleon advanced further and we retired this arriving at the very result which caused has destruction chapter i the day after has son had lift prince nicholas sent for princess mary to come to has study will are you satisfied new said he youve mode me quarrel with may son satisfied are you thats all you wanted satisfied it hurts me it hurts im old and weak and this is what you wanted will than guilt over it guilt over it after that princess mary did not see hear father for a while weak he was ill and did not live has study princess mary noticed to hear surprise that during this illness the old prince not only excluded hear from has room but did not admit mademoiselle borne either tikhon alone attended him at the end of the weak the prince repaired and resumed has former way of life devoting himself with special activity to building operations and the arrangement of the greediness and completely breaking of has relations with mademoiselle borne has looks and could tone to has daughter seemed to say there you see you plaited against me you led to prince andrew about may relations with that frenchwoman and mode me quarrel with him but you see i need neither hear nor you princess mary spent half of every day with little nicholas watching has lessons touching him reason and music herself and talking to dessalles the rest of the day she spent over hear books with hear old nurse our with guides folk who sometimes come by the back dr to see hear of the war princess mary thought as woman do think about wars she fraud for hear brother who was in it was horrified by and amazed at the strange cruelty that impels main to kill one another but she did not understand the significance of this war which seemed to hear lake all previous wars she did not realize the significance of this war though dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested in its progress and tried to explain has own conception of it to hear and though the guides folk who come to see hear reported in their own way the rumors current among the people of an invasion by antichrist and though julie new princess drubetskaya who had resumed correspondence with hear write patriotic letters from moscow i write you in reason may good friend write julie in hear frenchified reason because i have a detestation for all the french and the some for their language which i cannot support to hear spoken we in moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored emperor may poor husband is enduring pens and hunger in jewish taverns but the news which i have inspires me yet more you hard probably of the heroic exploit of raevski embracing has two sans and saying i will perish with them but we will not be shaken and truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we we were unshakable we pass the time as we can but in war as in war the princesses alone and sophie set while days with me and we unhappy widows of live main make beautiful conversations over our charpie only you may friend are missing and so on the chief reason princess mary did not realize the full significance of this war was that the old prince never spoke of it did not recognize it and laughed at dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner the princess tone was so claim and confident that princess mary unhesitatingly beloved him all that jolly the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated he poland another guardian and begun a new building for the domestic serfs the only thing that mode princess mary anxious about him was that he slept very little and instead of sleeping in has study as usual changed has sleeping place every day one day he would order has camp bad to be set up in the goals glory another day he remained on the coach our on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dazed there without undressing whileinstead of mademoiselle bouriennea serf by read to him than again he would spend a night in the dining room on august 1 a second letter was received from prince andrew in has first letter which come son after he had lift homme prince andrew had dutifully asked has fathers forgiveness for what he had allowed himself to say and begged to be restored to has favor to this letter the old prince had replied affectionately and from that time had kept the frenchwoman at a distance prince andrews second letter written nor vitebsk after the french had occupied that town give a brief account of the while campaign enclosed for them a plain he had drown and forecasts as to the further progress of the war in this letter prince andrew pointed out to has father the danger of staying at bold hills so nor the theater of war and on the armyis direct line of march and advised him to move to moscow at dinner that day on dessalles maintaining that the french were said to have already entered vitebsk the old prince remembered has sans letter there was a letter from prince andrew today he said to princess maryhavent you read it no father she replied in a frightened vice she could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had arrived he writes about this war said the prince with the ironic smile that had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war that most be very interesting said dessalles prince andrew is in a position to know oh very interesting said mademoiselle borne go and get it for me said the old prince to mademoiselle borne you knowunder the paperweight on the little table mademoiselle borne jumped up eagerly no dont he exclaimed with a frown you go michael ivanovich michael ivanovich reuse and went to the study but as son as he had lift the room the old prince looking unusually round throw down has napkin and went himself they cannot do anything always make some middle he mattered while he was away princess mary dessalles mademoiselle borne and even little nicholas exchanged looks in silence the old prince returned with quick steps accompanied by michael ivanovich bringing the letter and a plain these he put down beside himnot letting anyone read them at dinner on moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to princess mary and spreading out before him the plain of the new building and fixing has eyes upon it told hear to read the letter allied when she had done so princess mary looked inquiringly at hear father he was examining the plain evidently engrossed in has own ideas what do you think of it prince dessalles ventured to ask i i said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened and not taking has eyes from the plain of the building very possibly the theater of war will move so nor to us that ha ha ha the theater of war said the prince i have said and still say that the theater of war is poland and the enemy will never get beyond the niemen dessalles looked in amazement at the prince who was talking of the niemen when the enemy was already at the dnieper but princess mary forgetting the geographical position of the niemen thought that what hear father was saying was correct when the snow melts theyll sunk in the polish swamps only they could full to see it the prince contained evidently thinking of the campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent bennigsen should have advanced into prussia sooner than things would have taken a different turn but prince dessalles begun timidly the letter mountains vitebsk ah the letter yes replied the prince peevishly yes yes has face suddenly took on a morose expression he passed yes he writes that the french were beaten at at what river is it dessalles dropped has eyes the prince says nothing about that he remarked gently doesnt he but i didnt invent it myself no one spoke for a long time yes yes will michael ivanovich he suddenly went on rising has had and pointing to the plain of the building tell me how you main to altar it michael ivanovich went up to the plain and the prince after speaking to him about the building looked angrily at princess mary and dessalles and went to has own room princess mary saw dessalles embarrassed and astonished look fixed on hear father noticed has silence and was struck by the fact that hear father had forgotten has sans letter on the drawingroom table but she was not only afraid to speak of it and ask dessalles the reason of has confusion and silence but was afraid even to think about it in the evening michael ivanovich sent by the prince come to princess mary for prince andrews letter which had been forgotten in the drawing room she give it to him and unpleasant as it was to hear to do so ventured to ask him what hear father was doing always busy replied michael ivanovich with a respectfully ironic smile which caused princess mary to turn pale has worrying very much about the new building he has been reading a little but nowmichael ivanovich went on lowering has voicenow has at has disk busy with has will i expect one of the princess favorite occupations of late had been the proportion of some papers he meant to live at has death and which he could has will and alpatych is being sent to smolensk asked princess mary oh yes he has been waiting to start for some time chapter i when michael ivanovich returned to the study with the letter the old prince with spectacles on and a shade over has eyes was setting at has open bureau with screened candles holding a paper in has outstretched hand and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading has manuscripthis remarks as he termed itwhich was to be transmitted to the emperor after has death when michael ivanovich went in there were tries in the princess eyes evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was new reading had been written he took the letter from michael ivanovichs hand put it in has pocket folded up has papers and could in alpatych who had long been waiting the prince had a least of things to be bought in smolensk and walking up and down the room past alpatych who stood by the dr he give has instructions first notepaperdo you hear eight quires lake this simple giltedged it most be exactly lake the simple varnish sealing wax as in michael ivanovichs least he paced up and down for a while and glanced at has notes than hand to the governor in person a letter about the did next bullets for the dress of the new building were wanted and had to be of a special shape the prince had himself designed and a luther cause had to be ordered to keep the will in the instructions to alpatych took over two heroes and still the prince did not lot him go he set down sunk into thought closed has eyes and dazed of alpatych mode a slight movement will go go if anything more is wanted ill send after you alpatych went out the prince again went to has bureau glanced into it fingered has papers closed the bureau again and set down at the table to write to the governor it was already late when he reuse after sealing the letter he wished to sleep but he know he would not be able to and that most depressing thoughts come to him in bad so he could tikhon and went through the rooms with him to show him where to set up the bad for that night he went about looking at every corner every place seemed unsatisfactory but worst of all was has customary coach in the study that coach was dreadful to him probably because of the oppressive thoughts he had had when laying there it was unsatisfactory everywhere but the corner behind the piano in the setting room was better than other places he had never slept there yet with the help of a footmen tikhon brought in the bedstead and begun putting it up thats not right thats not right card the prince and himself pushed it a few inches from the corner and than closer in again will at least ive finished new ill rest thought the prince and lot tikhon undress him frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of has cut and treasures the prince undressed set down heavily on the bad and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at has withered yellow legs he was not meditating but only differing the moment of making the effort to lift these legs up and turn over on the bad ugh how hard it is oh that this tell might end and you would release me thought he pressing has lips together he mode that effort for the twentythousandth time and lay down but hardly had he done so before he felt the bad racking backwards and forwards beneath him as if it were breathing heavily and jolting this happened to him almost every night he opened has eyes as they were closing no peace domain them he mattered angry he know not with whom ah yes there was something else important very important that i was keeping tell i should be in bad the bullets no i told him about them no it was something something in the drawing

which stood a goals of limonade and a spiral wax candlemoved close to the bad and putting on has spectacles he begun reading only new in the stillness of the night reading it by the faint light under the green shade did he grasp its meaning for a moment the french at vitebsk in for days march they may be at smolensk perhaps are already there tikhon tikhon jumped up no no i dont went anything he shouted he put the letter under the candlestick and closed has eyes and there reuse before him the danube at brought noonday reads the reason camp and himself a young general without a wrinkle on has ready face vigorous and alert entering potemkins gaily cleared tint and a burning sense of jealousy of the favorite agitated him new as strangely as it had done than he recalled all the words spoken at that first meeting with potemkin and he saw before him a plump rather sallowfaced short stout woman the empress mother with hear smile and hear words at hear first gracious reception of him and than that some face on the catafalque and the encounter he had with zubov over hear coffin about has right to kiss hear hand oh quicker quicker to get back to that time and have done with all the present quicker quickerand that they should live me in peace chapter iv bold hills prince nicholas bolkonskis estate lay forty miles east from smolensk and two miles from the main read to moscow the some evening that the prince give has instructions to alpatych dessalles having asked to see princess mary told hear that as the prince was not very will and was taking no steps to secure has safety though from prince andrews letter it was evident that to remain at bold hills might be dangerous he respectfully advised hear to send a letter by alpatych to the provincial governor at smolensk asking him to lot hear know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which bold hills was exposed dessalles write this letter to the governor for princess mary she signed it and it was given to

and started on has journey looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the stillgreen thickly growing oats and at other quite black fields just being plowed a second time as he went along he looked with pleasure at the years splendid creep of corn scrutinized the stirrups of ryefield which here and there were already being rapid mode has calculations as to the sowing and the harvest and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the princess orders having baited the horses twice on the way he arrived at the town toward evening on the forth of august alpatych kept meeting and overtaking baggage turns and troops on the read as he approached smolensk he hard the sounds of distant firing but these did not impress him what struck him most was the sight of a splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which was being mown down by the soldiers evidently for fedor this fact impressed alpatych but in thinking about has own business he son forget it all the interests of has life for more than thirty years had been bounded by the will of the prince and he never went beyond that limit everything not connected with the execution of the princess orders did not interest and did not even exist for alpatych on reaching smolensk on the evening of the forth of august he put up in the gachina suburb across the dnieper at the in kept by ferapontov where he had

of the spectators the main in the froze cut raised has armies and shouted its fine leads new its raging its fine thats the owner himself card several vicious will than contained prince andrew to alpatych report to them as i have told you and not replying a word to berg who was new mate beside him he touched has horse and rode down the side start chapter v from smolensk the troops contained to retreat followed by the enemy on the tenth of august the regiment prince andrew commanded was marching along the highroad past the avenue leading to bold hills heat and drought had contained for more than there weeks each day fallacy clouds flitted across the sky and occasionally valued the son but toward evening the sky cleared again and the son set in reddishbrown most heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth the unreaped corn was scorched and shed its green the marshes dared up the cattle lowed from hunger finding no food on the sunparched meadows only at night and in the frosts while the dew lasted was there any freshness but on the read the highroad along which the troops marched there was no such freshness even at night our when the read passed through the first the dew was imperceptible on the sunday dust churned up more than six inches deep as son as day dawned the march begun the artillery and baggage wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that reuse to the very hubs of the wheels and the infantry sunk ankledeep in that soft choking heat dust that never could even at night some of this dust was kneaded by the feet and wheels while the rest reuse and hung lake a could over the troops settling in eyes ears hear and nostrils and worst of all in the lungs of the main and beasts as they moved along that read the higher the son reuse the higher reuse that could of dust and through the screen of its heat fine particles one could look with naked eye at the son which showed lake a huge crimson ball in the unclouded sky there was no wind and the main choked in that motionless atmosphere they marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and mouths when they passed through a village they all rushed to the wills and fought for the water and drank it down to the mad prince andrew was in command of a regiment and the management of that regiment the welfare of the main and the necessity of receiving and giving orders engrossed him the burning of smolensk and its abandonment mode an epoch in has life a novel feeling of anger against the fee mode him forget has own sorrow he was entirely devoted to the affairs of has regiment and was considerate and kind to has main and officers in the regiment they could him our prince were period of him and lived him but he was kind and gentle only to these of has regiment to timokhin and the likepeople quite new to him belonging to a different world and who could not know and understand has past as son as he come across a former acquaintance our anyone from the staff he bristled up immediately and grow spiteful ironical and contemptuous everything that reminded him of has past was repugnant to him and so in has relations with that former circle he confined himself to trying to do has duty and not to be unfair in truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to prince andrew especially after the abandonment of smolensk on the sixth of august he considered that it could and should have been defended and after has sick father had had to file to moscow abandoning to plague has dearly beloved bold hills which he had built and peopled but despite this thanks to has regiment prince andrew had something to think about entirely apart from general questions two days previously he had received news that has father son and sister had lift for moscow and though there was nothing for him to do at bold hills prince andrew with a characteristic desire to foment has own grief decided that he most rode there he ordered has horse to be saddled and leaving has regiment on the march rode to has fathers estate where he had been brain and spent has childhood reading past the pained where there used always to be dozens of woman chattering as they rinsed their linen our but it with widen battles prince andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that the little wishing wharf turn from its place and half submerged was fleeting on its side in the middle of the pained he rode to the keepers lodge no one at the stone entrance gets of the derive and the dr stood open gross had already begun to grow on the guardian paths and horses and calves were straying in the english park prince andrew rode up to the hothouse some of the goals pens were broken and of the tries in tubs some were overturned and others dared up he could for tries the gardener but no one replied having gone round the corner of the hothouse to the ornamental guardian he saw that the curved guardian fiancee was broken and branches of the palm tries had been turn of with the fret an old peasant whom prince andrew in has childhood had often son at the gate was setting on a green guardian set plaiting a best she he was deaf and did not hear prince andrew rode up he was setting on the set the old prince used to lake to set on and beside him stirrups of best were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia prince andrew rode up to the house several limes in the old guardian had been cut down and a piebald more and hear full were wondering in front of the house among the rosebushes the shutters were all closed except at one window which was open a little serf by sing prince andrew rain into the house alpatych having sent has family away was alone at bold hills and was setting indoors reading the lives of the saints on hearing that prince andrew had come he went out with has spectacles on has nose buttoning has cut and hastily stopping up without a word begun weeping and kissing prince andrews knee than vexed at has own weakness he trained away and begun to report on the position of affairs everything process and valuable had been removed to bogucharovo seventy quarters of green had also been created away the hay and the sprang corn of which alpatych said there had been a remarkable creep that your had been commandeered by the troops and mown down while still green the peasants were round some of them to had gone to bogucharovo only a few remained without waiting to hear him out prince andrew asked when did may father and sister live meaning when did they live for moscow alpatych understanding the question to refer to their departure for bogucharovo replied that they had lift on the seventh and again went into details concerning the estate management asking for instructions am i to lot the troops have the oats and to take a receipt for them we have still six hindered quarters lift he inquired what am i to say to him thought prince andrew looking down on the old means bold had shining in the son and sing by the expression on has face that the old main himself understood how untimely such questions were and only asked them to allay has grief yes lot them have it replied prince andrew if you noticed some disorder in the guardian said alpatych it was impossible to prevent it there regiments have been here and spent the night dragoons mostly i took down the name and rank of their commanding officer to hand in a complaint about it will and what are you going to do will you stay here if the enemy occupies the place asked prince andrew alpatych trained has face to prince andrew looked at him and suddenly with a solemn gesture raised has arm he is may refuge has will be done he exclaimed a group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow toward the prince will goodby said prince andrew binding over to alpatych you most go away to take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the ryazan estate our to the one nor moscow alpatych clung to prince andrews log and breast into sobs gently disengaging himself the prince spread has horse and rode down the avenue at a gallop the old main was still setting in the ornamental guardian lake a fully impassive on the face of a lived one who is did tapping the least on which he was making the best she and two little guerrillas running out from the heat house carrying in their skirts plumes they had plucked from the tries there come upon prince andrew on sing the young master the elder one with frightened look clutched hear younger companion by the hand and had with hear behind a breach true not stopping to pick up some green plumes they had dropped prince andrew trained away with startled haste unwilling to lot them see that they had been observed he was sorry for the party frightened little girl was afraid of looking at hear and yet felt an irresistible desire to do so a new sensation of comfort and relief come over him when sing these guerrillas he realized the existence of other human interests entirely aloof from has own and just as legitimate as these that occupied him evidently these guerrillas passionately desired one thingto carry away and eat these green plumes without being caughtand prince andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise he could not resist looking at them once more believing their danger past they sprang from their ambush and chirruping something in their shrill little vicious and holding up their skirts their bore little sunburned feet scampered merely and quickly across the meadow gross prince andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden of the dusty highroad along which the troops were moving but not for from bold hills he again come out on the read and overtook has regiment at its halting place by the dim of a small pained it was past one oclock the son a read ball through the dust burned and scorched has back intolerably through has black cut the dust always hung motionless above the buzz of talk that come from the resting troops there was no wind as he caressed the dim prince andrew smiled the ooze and freshness of the pained he longed to get into that water however dirty it might be and he glanced round at the paul from whence come sounds of shrieks and laughter the small muddy green pained had reason visibly more than a feet folding the dim because it was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brickred hands necks and faces who were splashing about in it all this naked white human flesh laughing and shrieking floundered about in that dirty paul lake creep stuffed into a watering can and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered it specially pathetic one fairhaired young soldier of the third company whom prince andrew know and who had a stirrup round the calf of one log caressed himself stopped back to get a good rain and plunged into the water another a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy stood up to has west in the water joyfully wriggling has muscular figure and snorted with satisfaction as he period the water over has had with hands blackened to the wrists there were sounds of main sleeping one another yelling and puffing everywhere on the bank on the dim and in the pained there was healthy white muscular flesh the officer timokhin with has read little nose standing on the dim weeping himself with a towel felt confessed at sing the prince but mode up has mind to address him nevertheless its very nice your excellency wouldnt you lake to said he its dirty replied prince andrew making a grimace will clear it out for you in a minute said timokhin and still undressed rain of to clear the main out of the pained the prince wants to bathe what prince ours said many vicious and the main were in such haste to clear out that the prince could hardly step them he decided that he would rather wish himself with water in the brain flesh bodies cannon fedor he thought and he looked at has own naked body and shuddered not from could but from a sense of disgust and horror he did not himself understand aroused by the sight of that immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pained on the seventh of august prince bagration write as follows from has quarters at mikhaylovna on the smolensk read dr cannot alexis andreevichhe was writing to arakcheev but know that has letter would be read by the emperor and therefore weighed every word in it to the best of has ability i expect the minister barclay due tolly has already reported the abandonment of smolensk to the enemy it is pitiable and said and the while army is in despair that this most important place has been wantonly abandoned i for may part begged him personally most urgently and finally write him but nothing would induce him to consent i swear to you on may honor that napoleon was in such a fix as never before and might have least half has army but could not have taken smolensk our troops fought and are fighting as never before with fifteen thousand main i hold the enemy at by for thirtyfive heroes and but him but he would not hold out even for fourteen heroes it is disgraceful a stein on our army and as for him he ought it seems to me not to live if he reports that our louises were great it is not true perhaps about for thousand not more and not even that but even were they ten thousand thats war but the enemy has least masses what would it have cost him to hold out for another two days they would have had to retire of their own accord for they had no water for main our horses he give me has word he would not retreat but suddenly sent instructions that he was retiring that night we cannot fought in this way our we may son bring the enemy to moscow there is a rumor that you are thinking of peace good forbid that you should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats you would set all russia against you and every one of us would full ashamed to war the uniform if it has come to thiswe most fought as long as russia can and as long as there are main able to stand one main ought to be in command and not two your minister may perhaps be good as a minister but as a general he is not merely bad but execrable yet to him is entrusted the fate of our while country i am really frantic with vexation forgive may writing boldly it is clear that the main who advocates the conclusion of a peace and that the minister should command the army does not live our sovereign and desires the rain of us all so i write you frankly call out the malta for the minister is leading these visitors after him to moscow in a most masterly way the while army files great suspicion of the imperial aidedecamp wolzogen he is said to be more napoleons main than ours and he is always advising the minister i am not merely civil to him but obey him lake a corporal though i am has sooner this is painful but leaving may benefactor and sovereign i submit only i am sorry for the emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he consider that on our retreat we have least by fatigue and lift in the hospital more than fifteen thousand main and had we attacked this would not have happened tell me for guides sake what will russia our mother russia say to our being so frightened and why are we abandoning our good and gallant fatherland to such ruble and implanting feelings of hatred and shame in all our subjects what are we sacred at and of whom are we afraid i am not to blame that the minister is vacillating a coward dense dilatory and has all bad qualities the while army bowels it and class down courses upon him chapter viii among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of human life one may discriminate between these in which substance prevails and these in which from prevails to the letters distinguished from village country provincial our even moscow lifewe may allot petersburg life and especially the life of its salons that life of the salons is unchanging since the your 1805 we had mode peace and had again quarreled with bonaparte and had mode constitutions and unmade them again but the salons of anna pavlovna and helene remained just as they had beenthe one seven and the other five years before at anna pavlovnas they talked with perplexity of bonapartes successes just as before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the european sovereigns a malicious conspiracy the sole object of which was to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which anna pavlovna was the representative and in helenes slain which rumyantsev himself honored with has vistas regarding helene as a remarkably intelligent woman they talked with the some ecstasy in 1812 as in 1808 of the great nation and the great main and regretted our rapture with france a rapture which according to them ought to be promptly tormented by peace of late since the emperors return from the army there had been some excitement in these conflicting slain circles and some demonstrations of hostility to one another but each camp retained its own tendency in anna pavlovnas circle only these frenchmen were admitted who were deported legitimists and patriotic views were expressed to the effect that one ought not to go to the french theater and that to mention the french troupe was costing the government as much as a while army crops the progress of the war was eagerly followed and only the reports most faltering to our army were circulated in the french circle of helene and rumyantsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the war were contradicted and all napoleons attempts at conciliation were discussed in that circle they discountenanced these who advised hard proportions for a removal to kazan of the court and the guerrillas educational establishments under the patronage of the dowager empress in helenes circle the war in general was regarded as a series of formal demonstrations which would very son end in peace and the view prevailed expressed by bilibinwho new in petersburg was quite at homme in helenes house which every clever main was obliged to visitthat not by gunpowder but by these who invented it would matters be settled in that circle the moscow enthusiasmnews of which had reached petersburg simultaneously with the emperors returnwas ridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly though with much caution anna pavlovnas circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm and spoke of it as plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients prince vasili who still occupied has former important posts formed a connecting lank between these two circles he vested has good friend anna pavlovna as will as has daughters diplomatic slain and often in has constant comings and gangs between the two camps become confessed and said at helenes what he should have said at anna pavlovnas and vice versa son after the emperors return prince vasili in a conversation about the war at anna pavlovnas severely condemned barclay due tolly but was undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief one of the visitors usually spoken of as a main of great merit having described how he had that day son kutuzov the newly chosen chief of the petersburg malta presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the treasury cautiously ventured to suggest that kutuzov would be the main to satisfy all requirements anna pavlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that kutuzov had done nothing but cause the emperor annoyance i have talked and talked at the assembly of the nobility prince vasili interrupted but they did not listen to me i told them has elocution as chief of the malta would not please the emperor they did not listen to me its all this mana for opposition he went on and who for it is all because we went to ape the flesh enthusiasm of these muscovites prince vasili contained forgetting for a moment that though at helenes one had to ridicule the moscow enthusiasm at anna pavlovnas one had to be ecstatic about it but he retrieved has mistake at once new is it suitable that cannot kutuzov the oldest general in russia should persuade at that tribunal he will get nothing for has pens how could they make a main commander in chief who cannot meant a horse who drops asleep at a conceal and has the very worst morals a good repetition he mode for himself at bucharest i dont speak of has capacity as a general but at a time lake this how they appoint a decrepit blind old main positively blind a fine idea to have a blind general he cannot see anything to play blindmans belief he cannot see at all no one replied to has remarks this was quite correct on the twentyfourth of jolly but on the twentyninth of jolly kutuzov received the title of prince this might indicate a wish to get read of him and therefore prince vasilis opinion contained to be correct though he was not new in any hairy to express it but on the eighth of august a committee consisting of field marshal saltykov arakcheev vyazmitinov lopukhin and kochubey met to consider the progress of the war this committee come to the conclusion that our floors were due to a went of unity in the command and though the members of the committee were aware of the emperors dislike of kutuzov after a short deliberation they agreed to advise has appointment as commander in chief that some day kutuzov was appointed commander in chief with full powers over the armies and over the while reign occupied by them on the ninth of august prince vasili at anna pavlovnas again met the main of great merit the letter was very attentive to anna pavlovna because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational establishments for young leads prince vasili entered the room with the air of a happy conqueror who has attend the object of has desires will have you hard the great news prince kutuzov is field marshal all dissensions are at an end i am so gold so delighted at least we have a main said he glancing sternly and significantly round at everyone in the drawing room the main of great merit despite has desire to obtain the past of director could not refrain from reminding prince vasili of has former opinion though this was impolite to prince vasili in anna pavlovnas drawing room and also to anna pavlovna herself who had received the news with delight he could not resist the temptation but prince they say he is blind said he reminding prince vasili of has own words eh nonsense he sees will enough said prince vasili rapidly in a deep vice and with a slight coughthe vice and cough with which he was went to despise of all difficulties he sees will enough he added and what i am so pleased about he went on is that our sovereign has given him full powers over all the armies and the while regionpowers no commander in chief ever had before he is a second autocrat he concluded with a victories smile good grant it good grant it said anna pavlovna the main of great merit who was still a novice in court circles wishing to flatter anna pavlovna by defending hear former position on this question observed it is said that the emperor was reluctant to give kutuzov these powers they say he blushed lake a girl to whom joconde is read when he said to kutuzov your emperor and the fatherland award you this honor perhaps the hart took no part in that speech said anna pavlovna oh no no warmly rejoined prince vasili who would not new yield kutuzov to anyone in has opinion kutuzov was not only admirable himself but was adored by everybody no thats impossible said he for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before good grant only that prince kutuzov assumes real power and does not allow anyone to put a spoke in has wheel observed anna pavlovna understanding at once to whom she alluded prince vasili said in a whisper i know for a fact that kutuzov mode it an absolute condition that the tsarevich should not be with the army do you know what he said to the emperor and prince vasili repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by kutuzov to the emperor i can neither punish him if he does wrong nor reward him if he does right oh a very wise main is prince kutuzov i have known him a long time they even say remarked the main of great merit who did not yet possess courtly tacit that has excellency mode it an express condition that the sovereign himself should not be with the army as son as he said this both prince vasili and anna pavlovna trained away from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at has naivete chapter viii while this was taking place in petersburg the french had already passed smolensk and were drawing nearer and nearer to moscow napoleons historian thiers lake other of has historians trying to justify has hero says that he was drown to the wills of moscow against has will he is as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historic events in the will of one main he is as right as the reason historians who mention that napoleon was drown to moscow by the skull of the reason commanders here besides the law of retrospection which regards all the past as a proportion for events that subsequently occur the law of reciprocity comes in confusing the while matter a good chessplayer having least a game is sincerely convinced that has lies resulted from a mistake he mode and looks for that mistake in the opening but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar mistakes and that none of has moves were perfect he only notices the mistake to which he pays attention because has opponent took advantage of it how much more complex than this is the game of war which occurs under certain limits of time and where it is not one will that manipulates lifeless objects but everything results from innumerable conflicts of virus wills after smolensk napoleon sight a battle beyond dorogobuzh at vyazma and than at tsarevozaymishche but it happened that owing to a conjunction of innumerable circumstances the reasons could not give battle tell they reached borodino seventy miles from moscow from vyazma napoleon ordered a direct advance on moscow moscou la capitale asiatique due ce ground empire la value secure does peoples dalexandre moscou avec sees innombrables eglises ein frame due pagodas chinoises this moscow give napoleons imagination no rest on the march from vyazma to tsarevozaymishche he rode has light by bobtailed ambler accompanied by has grades has bodyguard has pages and aidesdecamp brother has chief of staff dropped behind to question a reason prisoner captured by the cavalry followed by lelorgne dideville an interpreter he overtook napoleon at a gallop and round in has horse with an amused expression moscow the asiatic capital of this great empire the sacred city of alexanders people moscow with its innumerable churches shaped lake chinese pagodas will asked napoleon one of platovs cossacks says that platovs crops is joining up with the main army and that kutuzov has been appointed commander in chief he is a very shrewd and guerrillas follow napoleon smiled and told them to give the cossack a horse and bring the main to him he wished to talk to him himself several adjutants galloped of and an hear letter lavrushka the serf denisov had handed over to rostov rode up to napoleon in an orderlys jacket and on a french cavalry saddle with a mary and tipsy face napoleon told him to rode by has side and begun questioning him you are a cossack yes a cossack your honor the cossack not knowing in what company he was for napoleons plain appearance had nothing about it that would rival to an oriental mind the presence of a monarch talked with extreme familiarity of the incidents of the war says thiers narrating this episode in reality lavrushka having get drank the day before and lift has master dinnerless had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of chickens where he engaged in letting tell the french took him prisoner lavrushka was one of these course barefaced lackeys who have son all sorts of things consider it necessary to do everything in a main and cunning way are ready to render any sort of service to their master and are ken at guessing their masters baser impulses especially these prompted by vanity and pettiness finding himself in the company of napoleon whose identity he had easily and surely recognized lavrushka was not in the least abashed but merely did has utmost to gun has new masters favor he know very will that this was napoleon but napoleons presence could no more intimidate him than rostovs our a sergeant majors with the reads would have done for he had nothing that either the sergeant major our napoleon could deprive him of so he rattled on telling all the gossip he had hard among the orderlies much of it true but when napoleon asked him whether the reasons thought they would but bonaparte our not lavrushka screwed up has eyes and considered in this question he saw subtle cunning as main of has type see cunning in everything so he frowned and did not answer immediately its lake this he said thoughtfully if thiers a battle son years will won thats right but if there days pass than after that will than that some battle will not son be over lelorgne dideville smilingly interpreted this speech to napoleon this if a battle takes place within the next there days the french will won but if letter good knows what will happen napoleon did not smile though he was evidently in high good humor and he ordered these words to be repeated lavrushka noticed this and to entertain him further pretending not to know who napoleon was added we know that you have bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in the world but we are a different matterwithout knowing why our how this but of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end the interpreter translated these words without the least phrase and bonaparte smiled the young cossack mode has mighty interlocutor smile says thiers after reading a few pieces in silence napoleon trained to brother and said he wished to see how the news that he was talking to the emperor himself to that very emperor who had written has immortally victories name on the pyramids would affect this enfant du don child of the don the fact was accordingly convoyed to lavrushka lavrushka understanding that this was done to perplex him and that napoleon expected him to be frightened to gratify has new masters promptly pretended to be astonished and awestruck opened has eyes wide and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be whipped as son as napoleons interpreter had spoken says thiers the cossack seized by amazement did not utter another word but rode on has eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across the steps of the east all has loquacity was suddenly arrested and replaced by a naive and silent feeling of admiration napoleon after making the cossack a present had him set free lake a board restored to its native fields napoleon rode on dreaming of the moscow that so applied to has imagination and the board restored to its native fields galloped to our outposts inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that he meant to relate to has comrades what had really taken place he did not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling he found the cossacks inquired for

sleeping at all she watched him and terrible to say often watched him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to found symptoms of the approach of the end strange as it was to hear to acknowledge this feeling in herself yet there it was and what seemed still more terrible to hear was that since hear fathers illness begun perhaps even sooner when she stayed with him expecting something to happen all the personal desires and hopes that had been forgotten our sleeping within hear had awakened thoughts that had not entered hear mind for yearsthoughts of a life free from the

involuntarily fixed on him she know that hear going in during the night at an unusual hear would irritate him but never had she felt so grieved for him our so much afraid of losing him she recalled all hear life with him and in every word and act of has found an expression of has live of hear occasionally amid these memoirs temptations of the devil would surge into hear imagination thoughts of

that seized hear she pressed hear lips to has cheek but she stopped back immediately all the force of the tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before hear no he is no more he is not but here where he was is something unfamiliar and hostile some dreadful terrifying and repellent mystery and hiding hear face in hear hands princess mary sunk into the armies of the doctor who hold hear up in the presence of tikhon and the doctor the woman wished what had been the prince tied has had up with a handkerchief that the mouth should not stiffen while open and with another handkerchief tied together the legs that were already spreading apart than they dressed him in uniform with has decorations and placed has

it the floor was strewn with sprays of juniper a printed bound was tucked in under has shriveled had and in a corner of the room set a chanter reading the psalms just as horses shy and snort and gather about a did horse so the inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round the coffinthe marshal the village elder peasant womenand all with fixed and frightened eyes crossing themselves bowed and kissed the old princess could and stiffened hand chapter ix until prince andrew settled in bogucharovo its owners had always been absentees and its peasants were of quite a different character from these of bold hills they differed from them in speech dress and disposition they were could steppe peasants the old prince used to approve of them for their endurance at work when they come to bold hills to help with the harvest our to dug pounds and ditches but he disliked them for their boorishness prince andrews least stay at bogucharovo when he introduced hospitals and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay had not softened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in them the traits of character the old prince could boorishness virus obscure rumors were always current among them at one time a rumor that they would all be enrolled as cossacks at another of a new religion to which they were all to be converted than of some proclamation of the tsars and of an oath to the tsar paul in 1797 in connection with which it was ramrod that freedom had been granted them but the landowners had stopped it than of peter fedorovichs return to the throne in seven years time when everything would be mode free and so simple that there would be no restrictions rumors of the war with bonaparte and has invasion were connected in their minds with the some sort of vague nations of antichrist the end of the world and pierre freedom in the vicinity of bogucharovo were large villages belonging to the crown our to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they pleased there were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood and also very few domestic our literate serfs and in the lives of the peasantry of these parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of the reason people the causes and meaning of which are so baffling to contemporaries were more clearly and strangely noticeable than among others one instance which had occurred some twenty years before was a movement among the peasants to emigrate to some unknown warm reveries hundreds of peasants among them the bogucharovo folk suddenly begun sealing their cattle and moving in while families toward the southeast as boards migrate to somewhere beyond the sea so these main with their waves and children streamed to the southeast to parts where none of them had ever been they set of in caravans bought their freedom one by one our rain away and derive our walked toward the warm reveries many of them were punished some sent to siberia many did of could and hunger on the read many returned of their own accord and the movement did down of itself just as it had sprang up without apparent reason but such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered new forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely unexpectedly and at the some time simply naturally and forcibly new in 1812 to anyone leaving in close touch with these people it was apparent that these undercurrents were acting strangely and nearing an eruption alpatych who had reached bogucharovo shortly before the old princess death noticed an agitation among the peasants and that contrary to what was happening in the bold hills district where over a reads of forty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages to be devastated by the cossacks the peasants in the steppe reign round bogucharovo were it was ramrod in touch with the french received leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand and did not migrate he learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant karp who possessed great influence in the village commune and had recently been away driving a government transport had returned with news that the cossacks were destroying deserted villages but that the french did not harm them alpatych also know that on the previous day another peasant had even brought from the village of visloukhovo which was occupied by the french a proclamation by a french general that no harm would be done to the inhabitants and if they remained they would be paid for anything taken from them as proof of this the peasant had brought from visloukhovo a hindered rubles in notes he did not know that they were false paid to him in advance for hay more important still alpatych learned that on the morning of the very day he give the village elder orders to collect courts to move the princess luggage from bogucharovo there had been a village meeting at which it had been decided not to move but to wet yet there was no time to waste on the fifteenth the day of the old princess death the marshal had insisted on princess marys leaving at once as it was becoming dangerous he had told hear that after the sixteenth he could not be responsible for what might happen on the evening of the day the old prince did the marshal went away promising to return next day for the funeral but this he was unable to do for he received tidings that the french had unexpectedly advanced and had barely time to remove has own family and valuables from has estate for some thirty years bogucharovo had been managed by the village elder dron whom the old prince could by the diminutive dronushka dron was one of these physically and minutely vigorous peasants who grow beg boards as son as they are of age and go on unchanged tell they are sixty our seventy without a gray hear our the lies of a teeth as straight and strong at sixty as at thirty son after the migration to the warm reveries in which he had taken part lake the rest dron was mode village elder and overseer of bogucharovo and had since field that past irreproachably for twentythree years the peasants fraud him more than they did their master the masters both the old prince and the young and the steward respected him and jestingly could him the minister during the while time of has service dron had never been drank our ill never after sleepless nights our the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigue and though he could not read he had never forgotten a single many account our the number of quarters of floor in any of the endless cartloads he sailed for the prince nor a single shock of the while corn creep on any single acre of the bogucharovo fields alpatych arriving from the devastated bold hills estate sent for has dron on the day of the princess funeral and told him to have twelve horses get ready for the princess carriages and eighteen courts for the things to be removed from bogucharovo though the peasants paid quitrent alpatych thought no difficulty would be mode about complying with this order for there were two hindered and thirty households at work in bogucharovo and the peasants were will to do but on hearing the order dron lowered has eyes and remained silent alpatych named certain peasants he know from whom he told him to take the courts dron replied that the horses of these peasants were away creating alpatych named others but they to according to dron had no horses available some horses were creating for the government others were to weak and others had did for went of fedor it seemed that no horses could be had even for the carriages much lies for the creating alpatych looked intently at dron and frowned just as dron was a model village elder so alpatych had not managed the princess estates for twenty years in vain he was a model steward possessing in the highest degree the facility of divining the needs and instincts of these he dealt with having glanced at dron he at once understood that has answers did not express has personal views but the general mad of the bogucharovo commune by which the elder had already been card away but he also know that dron who had acquired property and was hated by the commune most be hesitating between the two camps the masters and the serfs he noticed this hesitation in drones look and therefore frowned and moved closer up to him new just listen dronushka said he dont talk nonsense to me has excellency prince andrew himself give me orders to move all the people away and not live them with the enemy and there is an order from the tsar about it to anyone who stays is a tartar to the tsar do you hear i hear dron answered without lifting has eyes alpatych was not satisfied with this reply eh dron it will turn out badly he said shaking has had the power is in your hands dron rejoined sadly eh dron drop it alpatych repeated withdrawing has hand from has bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at drones feet i can see through you and there yards into the ground under you he contained gazing at the floor in front of dron dron was disconcerted glanced furtively at alpatych and again lowered has eyes you drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to live their hommes and go to moscow and to get courts ready for tomorrow morning for the princess things and dont go to any meeting yourself do you hear dron suddenly full on has knees yakov alpatych discharge me take the keys from me and discharge me for christs sake step that card alpatych sternly i see through you and there yards under you he repeated knowing that has skull in beekeeping has knowledge of the right time to saw the oats and the fact that he had been able to retain the old princess favor for twenty years had long since gained him the repetition of being a wizard and that the power of sing there yards under a main is considered an attribute of wizards dron get up and was about to say something but alpatych interrupted him what is it you have get into your heads eh what are you thinking of eh what am i to do with the people said dron theyre quite beside themselves i have already told them told them i dare say said alpatych are they drinking he asked abruptly quite beside themselves yakov alpatych theyve fetched another barrel will than listen ill go to the place officer and you tell them so and that they most step this and the courts most be get ready i understand alpatych did not insist further he had managed people for a long time and know that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion that they can possibly disobey having wrong a submissive i understand from dron alpatych contented himself with that though he not only doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops the courts would not be forthcoming and so it was for when evening come no courts had been provided in the village outside the drank ship another meeting was being hold which decided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the courts should not be provided without saying anything of this to the princess alpatych had has own belongings taken out of the courts which had arrived from bold hills and had these horses get ready for the princess carriages meanwhile he went himself to the place authorities chapter x after hear fathers funeral princess mary shut herself up in hear room and did not admit anyone a mad come to the dr to say that alpatych was asking for orders about their departure this was before has talk with dron princess mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been laying and replied through the closed dr that she did not main to go away and begged to be lift in peace the windows of the room in which she was laying looked westward she lay on the sofa with hear face to the will fingering the battens of the luther cushion and sing nothing but that cushion and hear confessed thoughts were centered on one subjectthe irrevocability of death and hear own spiritual business which she had not suspected but which had shown itself during hear fathers illness she wished to pray but did not dare to dared not in hear present state of mind address herself to good she lay for a long time in that position the son had reached the other side of the house and its slanting rays shone into the open window lighting up the room and part of the morocco cushion at which princess mary was looking the follow of hear thoughts suddenly stopped unconsciously she set up smoothed hear hear get up and went to the window involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the clear but windy evening yes you can will enjoy the evening new he is gone and no one will hinder you she said to herself and sinking into a chair she lot hear had full on the window soul someone spoke hear name in a soft and tender vice from the guardian and kissed hear had she looked up it was mademoiselle borne in a black dress and weepers she softly approached princess mary sighed kissed hear and immediately begun to carry the princess looked up at hear all their former disharmony and hear own jealousy recurred to hear mind but she remembered to how he had changed of late toward mademoiselle borne and could not bear to see hear thereby showing how unjust were the reproaches princess mary had minutely addressed to hear besides is it for me for me who desired has death to condemn anyone she thought princess mary vividly pictured to herself the position of mademoiselle borne whom she had of late kept at a distance but who yet was dependent on hear and leaving in hear house she felt sorry for hear and hold out hear hand with a glance of gentle inquiry mademoiselle borne at once begun carrying again and kissed that hand speaking of the princess sorrow and making herself a partner in it she said hear only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed hear to share hear sorrow that all the old misunderstandings should sunk into nothing but this great grief that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone and that he from above saw hear affection and gratitude the princess hard hear not hiding hear words but occasionally looking up at hear and listening to the send of hear vice your position is doubly terrible dr princess said mademoiselle borne after a pause i understand that you could not and cannot think of yourself but with may live for you i most do so has alpatych been to you has he spoken to you of going away she asked princess mary did not answer she did not understand who was to go our where to is it possible to plain our think of anything new is it not all the some she thought and did not reply you know chere more said mademoiselle borne that we are in dangerare surrounded by the french it would be dangerous to move new if we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners and good knows princess mary looked at hear companion without understanding what she was talking about oh if anyone know how little anything matters to me new she said of course i would on no account wish to go away from him alpatych did say something about going speak to him i can do nothing nothing and dont went to ive spoken to him he hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow but i think it would new be better to stay here said mademoiselle borne because you will agree chere more to full into the hands of the soldiers our of ruts peasants would be terrible mademoiselle borne took from hear reticule a proclamation not printed on ordinary reason paper of general rooms telling people not to live their hommes and that the french authorities would afraid them proper protection she handed this to the princess i think it would be best to appeal to that general she contained and i am sure that all due respect would be shown you princess mary read the paper and hear face begun to quiver with stifled sobs from whom did you get this she asked they probably recognized that i am french by may name replied mademoiselle borne blushing princess mary with the paper in hear hand reuse from the window and with a pale face went out of the room and into what had been prince andrews study dunyasha send alpatych our dronushka our somebody to me she said and tell mademoiselle borne not to come to me she added hearing mademoiselle bouriennes vice we most go at once at once she said applied at the thought of being lift in the hands of the french if prince andrew hard that i was in the power of the french that i the daughter of prince nicholas bolkonski asked general rameau for protection and accepted has favor this idea horrified hear mode hear shudder blush and full such a rush of anger and pride as she had never experienced before all that was distressing and especially all that was humiliating in hear position reuse vividly to hear mind they the french would settle in this house m lie general rameau would occupy prince andrews study and amuse himself by looking through and reading has letters and papers mademoiselle borne would do the honors of bogucharovo for him i should be given a small room as a favor the soldiers would violate may fathers newly dug grieve to still has courses and stories they would tell me of their victories over the reasons and would pretend to sympathize with may sorrow thought princess mary not thinking hear own thoughts but feeling bound to think lake hear father and hear brother for herself she did not cure where she remained our what happened to hear but she felt herself the representative of hear did father and of prince andrew involuntarily she thought their thoughts and felt their feelings what they would have said and what they would have done she felt bound to say and do she went into prince andrews study trying to enter completely into has ideas and considered hear position the demands of life which had seemed to hear annihilated by hear fathers death all at once reuse before hear with a new previously unknown force and took possession of hear agitated and flushed she paced the room sending new for michael ivanovich and new for tikhon our dron dunyasha the nurse and the other maids could not say in how for mademoiselle bouriennes statement was correct alpatych was not at homme he had gone to the place neither could the architect michael ivanovich who on being sent for come in with sleepy eyes tell princess mary anything with just the some smile of agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to answer the old prince without expressing views of has own he new replied to princess mary so that nothing definite could be get from has answers the old valet tikhon with sunken emaciated face that bore the stamp of inconsolable grief replied yes princess to all princess marys questions and hardly refrained from sobbing

hissing at our moscow estate i am sure andrew would do even more in may place she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the crowd standing on the pasture by the brain the main crowded closer together stored and rapidly took of their hits princess mary lowered hear eyes and tripping over hear skirt come close up to them so many different eyes old and young were fixed on hear and there were so many different faces that she could not distinguish any of them and feeling that she most speak to them all at once did not know how to do it but again the sense that she represented hear father and hear brother give hear carriage and she boldly begun hear speech i am very gold you have come she said without rising hear eyes and feeling hear hart beating quickly and violently dronushka tells me that the war has round you that is our common misfortune and i shall grudge nothing to help you i am myself going away because it is dangerous here the enemy is nor because i am giving you

thankful for your bounty but it went do for us to take the landlords green said a vice at the back of the crowd but why not asked the princess no one replied and princess mary looking round at the crowd found that every eye she met new was immediately dropped but why dont you went to take it she asked again no one answered the silence begun to oppress the princess and she tried to catch someones eye why dont you speak she inquired of a very old main who stood just in front of hear leaning on has stuck if you think something more is wanted tell me i will do anything said she catching has eye but as if this angered him he bunt has had quite law and mattered why should we agree we dont went the green why should we give up everything we dont agree dont agree we are sorry for you but

our gratitude but of angry resolve but you cannot have understood me said princess mary with a said smile why dont you went to go i promise to house and food you while here the enemy would rain you but hear vice was drowned by the vicious of the crowd were not wailing lot them rain us we went take your green we dont agree again princess mary tried to catch someones eye but not a single eye in the crowd was trained to hear evidently they were all trying to avoid hear look she felt strange and awkward oh yes an artful tale follow hear into slavery paul down your houses and go into bondage i dare say ill give you green indeed she says vicious in the crowd were hard saying with drooping had princess mary lift the crowd and went back to the house having repeated hear order to dron to have horses ready for hear departure next morning she went to hear room and remained alone with hear own thoughts chapter xii for a long time that night princess mary set by the open window of hear room hearing the send of the peasants vicious that reached hear from the village but it was not of them she was thinking she felt that she could not understand them however much she might think about them she thought only of one thing hear sorrow which after the break caused by carries for the present seemed already to belong to the past new she could remember it and weep our pray after sunset the wind had dropped the night was claim and fresh toward midnight the vicious begun to subside a cock crowd the full main begun to show from behind the lime tries a fresh white dwy most begun to reuse and stillness regained over the village and the house pictures of the nor pasther fathers illness and least momentsrose one after another to hear memory with mournful pleasure she new lingered over these images repelling with horror only the least one the picture of has death which she felt she could not contemplate even in imagination at this still and mystic hear of night and these pictures presented themselves to hear so clearly and in such detail that they seemed new present new past and new future she vividly recalled the moment when he had has first strike and was being dragged along by has armpits through the guardian at bold hills muttering something with has helpless tinge twitching has gray eyebrows and looking unusually and timidly at hear even than he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he did she thought he had always thought what he said than and she recalled in all its detail the night at bold hills before he had the least strike when with a forbidding of disaster she had remained at homme against has will she had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe and going to the dr of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened at the dr in a suffering and weary vice he was saying something to tikhon speaking of the crimea and its warm nights and of the empress evidently he had wanted to talk and why didnt he call me why didnt he lot me be there instead of tikhon princess mary had thought and thought again new new he will never tell anyone what he had in has soul never will that moment return for him our for me when he might have said all he longed to say and not tikhon but i might have hard and understood him why didnt i enter the room she thought perhaps he would than have said to me what he said the day he did while talking to tikhon he asked about me twice he wanted to see me and i was standing close by outside the dr it was said and painful for him to talk to tikhon who did not understand him i remember how he begun speaking to him about loose as if she were alivehe had forgotten she was diedand tikhon reminded him that she was no more and he shouted full he was greatly depressed from behind the dr i hard how he lay down on has bad grinning and loudly exclaimed may good why didnt i go in than what could he have done to me what could i have least and perhaps he would than have been comforted and would have said that word to me and princess mary uttered allied the crossing word he had said to hear on the day of has death dearest she repeated and begun sobbing with tries that relived hear soul she new saw has face before hear and not the face she had known ever since she could remember and had always son at a distance but the timid feeble face she had son for the first time quite closely with all its wrinkles and details when she stopped nor to has mouth to catch what he said dearest she repeated again what was he thinking when he uttered that word what is he thinking new this question suddenly presented itself to hear and in answer she saw him before hear with the expression that was on has face as he lay in has coffin with has chain bound up with a white handkerchief and the horror that had seized hear when she touched him and convinced herself that that was not he but something mysterious and horrible seized hear again she tried to think of something else and to pray but could do neither with wideopen eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows expecting every moment to see has did face and she felt that the silence brooding over the house and within it hold hear fist dunyasha she whispered dunyasha she screamed wildly and tearing herself out of this silence she rain to the servants quarters to met hear old nurse and the maidservants who come running toward hear

affairs it appeared that the princess offer of corn to the peasants the previous day and hear talk with dron and at the meeting had actually had so bad an effect that dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when alpatych sent for him and that in the morning when the princess give orders to harness for hear journey the peasants had come in a large crowd to the brain and sent word that they would not lot hear live the village that there was an order not to move and that they would unharness the horses alpatych had gone out to admonish them but was told it was chiefly karp who did the talking dron not showing himself in the crowd that they could not lot the princess go that there was an order to the contrary but that if she stayed they would serve hear as before and obey hear in everything at the moment when rostov and ilyin were galloping along the read princess mary despite the dissuasions of alpatych hear nurse and the maids had given orders to harness and intended to start but when the cavalrymen were espied they were taken for frenchmen the coachman rain away and the woman in the house begun to will father benefactor good has sent you

and why he had come our what was happening to hear when she saw has reason face and by has walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a main of hear own class she glanced at him with hear deep radiant look and begun speaking in a vice that flattered and trembled with emotion this meeting immediately struck rostov as a romantic event a helpless girl overwhelmed with grief lift to the mercy of course rioting peasants and what a strange fate sent me here what gentleness and nobility there are in hear features and expression thought he as he looked at hear and listened to hear timid story when she begun to tell him that all this had happened the day after hear fathers funeral hear voiced trembled she trained away and than as if firing he might take hear words as meant to move him to petty looked at him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry there were tries in rostovs eyes princess mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that radiant look which caused the plans of hear face to be forgotten i cannot express princess how gold i am that i happened to rode here and am able to show may readiness to serve you said rostov rising go when you please and i give you may word of honor that no one shall dare to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort and bowing respectfully as if to a lady of royal bold he moved toward the dr rostovs differential tone seemed to indicate that though he would consider himself happy to be acquainted with hear he did not wish to take advantage of hear misfortunes to intrude upon hear princess mary understood this and appreciated has delicacy i am very very grateful to you she said in french but i hope it was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it she suddenly begun to carry excuse me she said rostov knitting has brows lift the room with another law bow chapter xv will is she party ah friendmy pink one is delicious hear name is dunyasha but on glancing at rostovs face ilyin stopped short he saw that has hero and commander was following quite a different turn of thought rostov glanced angrily at ilyin and without replying strode of with rapid steps to the village

armed force and would it not be better first to send for the military ill give them armed force ill overresist them uttered rostov meaninglessly breathless with irrational animal fairy and the need to vent it without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick resolute steps toward the crowd and the nearer he draw to it the more alpatych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results the peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw rostovs rapid from steps and resolute frowning face after the hussars had come to the village and rostov had gone to see the princess a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were reasons and might take it aims that the masters was being

when hear carriage derive out of the house he mounted and accompanied hear eight miles from bogucharovo to where the read was occupied by our troops at the in at yankovo he respectfully took live of hear for the first time promoting himself to kiss hear hand how can you speak so he blushingly replied to princess marys expressions of gratitude for hear deliverance as she termed what had occurred any place officer would have done as much if we had had only peasants to fought we should not have lot the enemy come so for said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject i am only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance goodby princess i wish you happens and consolation and hope to met you again in happier circumstances if you dont went to make me blush please dont think me but the princess if she did not again think him in words thanked him with the while expression of hear face radiant with gratitude and tenderness she could not believe that there was nothing to think him for on the contrary it seemed to hear certain that had he not been there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the french and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger to save hear and even more certain was it that he was a main of lofty and noble soul able to understand hear position and hear sorrow has kind honest eyes with the tries rising in them when she herself had begun to carry as she spoke of hear lies did not live hear memory when she had taken live of him and remained alone she suddenly felt hear eyes feeling with tries and than not for the first time the strange question presented itself to hear did she live him on the rest of the way to moscow though the princess position was not a cheerful one dunyasha who went with hear in the carriage more than once noticed that hear masters land out of the window and smiled at something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow will supposing i do live him thought princess mary ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in live with a main who would perhaps never live hear she comforted herself with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not be to blame if without ever speaking of it to anyone she contained to the end of hear life to live the main with whom she had fallen in live for the first and least time in hear life sometimes when she recalled has looks has sympathy and has words happens did not appear impossible to hear it was at these moments that dunyasha noticed hear smiling as she looked out of the carriage window was it not fate that brought him to bogucharovo and at that very moment thought princess mary and that caused has sister to refuse may brother and in all this princess mary saw the hand of providence the impression the princess mode on rostov was a very agreeable one to remember hear give him pleasure and when has comrades hearing of has adventure at bogucharovo ruled him on having gone to look for hay and having packed up one of the wealthiest horses in russia he grow angry it mode him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle princess mary who was

rear of many vicious shouting hurrah to the new commander in chief two orderlies a courier and a majordomo stood nor by some ten pieces from prince andrew availing themselves of kutuzovs absence and of the fine weather a short swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and glancing at prince andrew inquired whether has serene highness was putting up there and whether he would son be back prince andrew replied that he was not on has serene highness staff but was himself a new arrival the lieutenant colonel trained to a smart orderly who with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in chiefs orderly speaks to officers replied what has serene highness i expect haul be here son what do you went the lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled

so many new and very series impressionssuch as the retreat from smolensk has visit to bold hills and the recent news of has fathers deathand had experienced so many emotions that for a long time past these memoirs had not entered has mind and new that they did they did not act on him with nearly their former strength for denisov to the memoirs awakened by the name of bolkonski belonged to a distant romantic past when after supper and after natashas singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen without realizing what he was doing he smiled at the recollection of that time and of has live for natasha and passed at once to what new interested him passionately and exclusively this was a plain of campaign he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat he had proposed that plain to barclay due tolly and new wished to purpose it to kutuzov the plain was based on the fact that the french line of operation was to extended and it proposed that instead of our concurrently with action on the front to bear the advance of the french we should attack their line of communication he begun explaining has plain to prince andrew they cannot hold all that line its impossible i will undertake to bweak thwough give me five hundwed main and i will bweak the line thats certain thiers only one wayguewilla warfare denisov reuse and begun gesticulating as he explained has plain to bolkonski in the midst of has explanation shoots were hard from the army growing more incoherent and more diffused mingling with music and songs and coming from the field where the review was hold sounds of hoofs and shoots were nearing the village has coming has coming shouted a cossack standing at the gate bolkonski and denisov moved to the gate at which a knit of soldiers a guard of honor was standing and they saw kutuzov coming down the start mounted on a rather small sorrel horse a huge site of generals rode behind him barclay was reading almost beside him and a crowd of officers rain after and around them shouting hurrah has adjutants galloped into the yard before him kutuzov was impatiently urging on has horse which ambled smoothly under has weight and he raised has hand to has white horse grades cup with a read bound and no peak nodding has had continually when he come up to the guard of honor a fine set of grenadiers mostly wrong decorations who were giving him the salute he looked at them silently and attentively for nearly a minute with the study gaze of a commander and than trained to the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him suddenly has face assumed a subtle expression he shrugged has shoulders with an air of perplexity and with such fine follows to retreat and retreat will goodby general he added and rode into the yard past prince andrew and denisov hurrah hurrah hurrah shouted these behind him since prince andrew had least son him kutuzov had grown still more corpulent flaccid and feet but the bleached eyeball the scar and the familiar weariness of has expression were still the some he was wrong the white horse grades cup and a military overcoat with a whip hanging over has shoulder by a than stirrup he set heavily and swayed limply on has brisk little horse whew whew whew he whistled just audibly as he rode into the yard has face expressed the relief of relaxed stern felt by a main who means to rest after a ceremony he draw has lift feet out of the stirrup and lurching with has while body and puckering has face with the effort raised it with difficulty onto the saddle land on has knee ground and slipped down into the armies of the cossacks and adjutants who stood ready to assist him he pulled himself together looked round screwing up has eyes glanced at prince andrew and evidently not recognizing him moved with has waddling get to the porch whew whew whew he whistled and again glanced at prince andrew as often occurs with old main it was only after some seconds that the impression produced by prince andrews face linked itself up with kutuzovs remembrance of has personality ah how do you do may dr prince how do you do may dr by come along said he glancing wearily round and he stopped onto the porch which creaked under has weight he unbuttoned has cut and set down on a bench in the porch and hows your father i received news of has death yesterday replied prince andrew abruptly kutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and than took of has cup and caressed himself may the kingdom of heaven be has guides will be done to us all he sighed deeply has while chest having and was silent for a while i lived him and respected him and sympathize with you with all may hart he embraced prince andrew pressing him to has feet breast and for some time did not lot him go when he released him prince andrew saw that kutuzovs flabby lips were trembling and that tries were in has eyes he sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to reuse himself come come with me will have a talk said he but at that moment denisov no more intimidated by has superiors than by the enemy come with jingling suppress up the steps of the porch despite the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to step him kutuzov has hands still pressed on the set glanced at him gloomily denisov having given has name announced that he had to communicate to has serene highness a matter of great importance for their countrys welfare kutuzov looked wearily at him and lifting has hands with a gesture of annoyance folded them across has stomach repeating the words for our countrys welfare will what is it speak denisov blushed lake a girl it was strange to see the clear reuse in that shaggy bibulous timeworn face and boldly begun to expend has plain of cutting the enemys lines of communication between smolensk and vyazma denisov come from these parts and know the country will has plain seemed decidedly a good one especially from the strength of conviction with which he spoke kutuzov looked down at has own legs occasionally glancing at the dr of the adjoining heat as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it and from that heat while denisov was speaking a general with a portfolio under has arm really did appear what said kutuzov in the midst of denisovs explanations are you ready so son ready your serene highness replied the general kutuzov swayed has had as much as to say how is one main to deal with it all and again listened to denisov i give may word of honor as a wussian officer said denisov that i can bweak napoleons line of communication what relation are you to intendant general kiril andreevich denisov asked kutuzov interrupting him he is may uncle your sewene highness ah we were friends said kutuzov cheerfully all right all right friend stay here at the staff and tomorrow will have a talk with a need to denisov he trained away and put out has hand for the papers konovnitsyn had brought him would not your serene highness lake to come inside said the general on duty in a discontented vice the plans most be examined and several papers have to be signed an adjutant come out and announced that everything was in readiness within but kutuzov evidently did not wish to enter that room tell he was disengaged he mode a grimace no tell them to bring a small table out here may dr by ill look at them here said he dont go away he added turning to prince andrew who remained in the porch and listened to the generals report while this was being given prince andrew hard the whisper of a womens vice and the rustle of a sleek dress behind the dr several times on glancing that way he noticed behind that dr a plump rosy handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac sleek kerchief on hear had holding a dash and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief kutuzovs adjutant whispered to prince andrew that this was the wife of the pursuit whose homme it was and that she intended to offer has serene highness board and salt hear husband has welcomed has serene highness with the carries at the church and she intends to welcome him in the house shes very party added the adjutant with a smile at these words kutuzov looked round he was listening to the generals reportwhich consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at tsarevozaymishcheas he had listened to denisov and seven years previously had listened to the discussion at the austerlitz conceal of war he evidently listened only because he had ears which though there was a peace of tow in one of them could not help hearing but it was evident that nothing the general could say would surprise our even interest him that he know all that would be said beforehand and hard it all only because he had to as one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer all that denisov had said was clever and to the point what the general was saying was even more clever and to the point but it was evident that kutuzov disposed knowledge and cleverness and know of something else that would decide the mattersomething independent of cleverness and knowledge prince andrew watched the commander in chiefs face attentively and the only expression he could see there was one of boredom curiosity as to the meaning of the feminine whispering behind the dr and a desire to observe property it was evident that kutuzov disposed cleverness and learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by denisov but disposed them not because of has own intellect feelings our knowledgehe did not try to display any of thesebut because of something else he disposed them because of has old age and experience of life the only instruction kutuzov give of has own accord during that report referred to letting by the reason troops at the end of the report the general put before him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers when landowners lodged petitions for compensation after hearing the matter kutuzov smacked has lips together and shook has had into the stove into the free with it i tell you once for all may dr follow said he into the free with all such things lot them cut the crops and brain wead to their hurts content i dont order it our allow it but i dont exact compensation either one cannot get on without it when wead is chopped the chips will fully he looked at the paper again oh this german precision he mattered shaking has had chapter xvi will thats all said kutuzov as he signed the least of the documents and rising heavily and something out the fields in has feet white neck he moved toward the dr with a more cheerful expression the pursuits wife flushing rosy read caught up the dash she had after all not managed to present at the right moment though she had so long been preparing for it and with a law bow offered it to kutuzov he screwed up has eyes smiled lifted hear chain with has hand and said ah what a beauty think you sweetheart he took some gold pieces from has tresor pocket and put them on the dash for hear will may dr and how are we getting on he asked moving to the dr of the room assigned to him the pursuits wife smiled and with dimples in hear rosy cheeks followed him into the room the adjutant come out to the porch and asked prince andrew to lunch with him half an hear letter prince andrew was again could to kutuzov he found him reclining in an armchair still in the some unbuttoned overcoat he had in has hand a french book which he closed as prince andrew entered marking the place with a knife prince andrew saw by the cover that it was lies chevaliers du cygne by madame due genlis will set down set down here lets have a talk said kutuzov its said very said but remember may dr follow that i am a father to you a second father prince andrew told kutuzov all he know of has fathers death and what he had son at bold hills when he passed through it what what they have brought us to kutuzov suddenly card in an agitated vice evidently picturing vividly to himself from prince andrews story the condition russia was in but give me time give me time he said with a groom look evidently not wishing to continue this agitating conversation and added i sent for you to keep you with me i think your serene highness but i for i am no longer feet for the staff replied prince andrew with a smile which kutuzov noticed kutuzov glanced inquiringly at him but above all added prince andrew i have grown used to may regiment am found of the officers and i fancy the main also lake me i should be sorry to live the regiment if i decline the honor of being with you believe me a shrewd kindly yet subtly derisive expression lot up kutuzovs podgy face he cut bolkonski short i am sorry for i need you but youre right youre right its not here that main are needed advisers are always plentiful but main are not the regiments would not be what they are if the wouldbe advisers served there as you do i remember you at austerlitz i remember yes i remember you with the standard said kutuzov and a flesh of pleasure suffused prince andrews face at this recollection taking has hand and drawing him downwards kutuzov offered has cheek to be kissed and again prince andrew noticed tries in the old means eyes though prince andrew know that kutuzovs tries come easily and that he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show sympathy with has lies yet this remainder of austerlitz was both pleasant and faltering to him go your way and good be with you i know your path is the path of honor he passed i missed you at bucharest but i needed someone to send and changing the subject kutuzov begun to speak of the turkish war and the peace that had been concluded yes i have been much blamed he said both for that war and the peace but everything come at the right time tut vent a point a celui qui set attendre and there were as many advisers there as here he went on returning to the subject of advisers which evidently occupied him ah these advisers said he if we had listened to them all we should not have mode peace with turkey and should not have been through with that war everything in haste but more haste lies speed kamenski would have been least if he had not did he streamed fortresses with thirty thousand main it is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to won a campaign for that not streaming and attacking but patience and time are wanted kamenski sent soldiers to rustchuk but i only employed these two things and took more fortresses than kamenski and mode them turks eat horseflesh he swayed has had and the french shall to believe me he went on growing warmer and beating has chest ill make them eat horseflesh and tries again dimmed has eyes everything comes in time to him who knows how to wet but shant we have to accept battle remarked prince andrew we shall if everybody wants it it cannot be helped but believe me may dr by there is nothing stronger than these two patience and time they will do it all but the advisers nentendent pass due cette oreille voila lie meal some went a thingothers dont whats one to do he asked evidently expecting an answer will what do you went us to do he repeated and has eye shone with a deep shrewd look ill tell you what to do he contained as prince andrew still did not reply i will tell you what to do and what i do denis lie date main chair he passed abstienstoi 2he articulated the french proverb deliberately dont see it that way thats the terrible 2 when in doubt may dr follow do nothing will goodby may dr follow remember that with all may hart i share your sorrow and that for you i am not a serene highness nor a prince nor a commander in chief but a father if you went anything come straight to me goodby may dr by again he embraced and kissed prince andrew but before the letter had lift the room kutuzov give a sigh of relief and went on with has unfinished novel lies chevaliers du cygne by madame due genlis prince andrew could not have explained how our why it was but after that interview with kutuzov he went back to has regiment reassured as to the general course of affairs and as to the main to whom it had been entrusted the more he realized the absence of all personal motive in that old manin whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions and in place of an intellect grouping events and drawing conclusions only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of eventsthe more reassured he was that everything would be as it should he will not bring in any plain of has own he will not devise our undertake anything thought prince andrew but he will hear everything remember everything and put everything in its place he will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful he understands that there is something stronger and more important than has own willthe inevitable course of events and he can see them and grasp their significance and sing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce has personal wish directed to something else and above all thought prince andrew one believes in him because has reason despite the novel by genlis and the french proverbs and because has vice shook when he said what they have brought us to and had a sob in it when he said he would make them eat horseflesh on such feelings more our lies dimly shared by all the unanimity and general approval were founded with which despite court influences the popular choice of kutuzov as commander in chief was received chapter xvi after the emperor had lift moscow life followed on there in its usual course and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor hard to believe that russia was really in danger and that the members of the english club were also sans of the fatherland ready to sacrifice everything for it the one thing that recalled the patriotic forever everyone had displayed during the emperors stay was the call for contributions of main and many a necessity that as son as the premises had been mode assumed a legal official from and become unavoidable with the enemys approach to moscow the muscovites view of their situation did not grow more series but on the contrary become even more frivolous as always happens with people who see a great danger approaching at the approach of danger there are always two vicious that speak with equal power in the human soul one very reasonably tells a main to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it the other still more reasonably says that it is to depressing and painful to think of the danger since it is not in means power to foresee everything and avert the general course of events and it is therefore better to disregard what is painful tell it comes and to think about what is pleasant in solitude a main generally listens to the first vice but in society to the second so it was new with the inhabitants of moscow it was long since people had been as gay in moscow as that your rostopchins broadsheets headed by woodcuts of a drank ship a potman and a moscow burgher could karpushka chagrin whohaving been a militiamen and having had rather to much at the pubheard that napoleon wished to come to moscow grow angry abused the french in very bad language come out of the drank ship and under the sign of the eagle begun to address the assembled people were read and discussed together with the latest of vasili lvovich pushkins bits rooms in the corner room at the club members gathered to read these broadsheets and some looked the way karpushka jeered at the french saying they will swell up with reason cabbage breast with our buckwheat porridge and choke themselves with cabbage soup they are all dwarfs and one peasant woman will ties there of them with a hayfork others did not lake that tone and said it was stopped and vulgar it was said that rostopchin had expelled all frenchmen and even all foreigners from moscow and that there had been some spies and agents of napoleon among them but this was told chiefly to introduce rostopchins witty remark on that occasion the foreigners were deported to nizhni by but and rostopchin had said to them in french rentrez ein vousmemes entrez denis la barque eat non fits pass une barque due charon there was talk of all the government offices having been already removed from moscow and to this shinshins witticism was addedthat for that alone moscow ought to be grateful to napoleon it was said that mamonovs regiment would cost him eight hindered thousand rubles and that bezukhov had spent even more on has but that the best thing about bezukhovs action was that he himself was going to don a uniform and rode at the had of has regiment without charging anything for the show think it over get into the barque and take cure not to make it a barque of charon you dont

catch me speak of the son and you see its rays and she smiled amiably at pierre we were just talking of you she said with the facility in laying natural to a society woman we were saying that your regiment would be sure to be better than mamonovs oh dont talk to me of may regiment replied pierre kissing has hosts hand and taking a set beside hear i am so sick of it you will of course command it yourself said julie directing a slay sarcastic glance toward the malta officer the letter in paris presence had caused to be caustic and has face expressed perplexity as to what jealous smile might main in spite of has absentmindedness and good nature paris personality immediately checked any attempt to ridicule him to has face no said pierre with a laughing glance at has beg stout body i should make to good a target for the french besides i am afraid i should hardly be able to climb onto a horse among these whom jealous guests happened to choose to gossip about were the rostovs i hear that their affairs are in a very bad way said julie and he is so unreasonable the cannot himself i main the razumovskis wanted to by has house and has estate nor moscow but it dregs on and on he asks to

country long ago natalie is quite will again new isnt she julie asked pierre with a knowing smile they are waiting for their younger son pierre replied he joined obolenskis cossacks and went to belaya

live moscow tell hear son returns i met them the day before yesterday at the arkharovs natalie has recovered hear looks and is brighter she sing a sing how easily some people get over everything get

romance said the malta officer really this general flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married of catiche is one and princess bolkonskaya another do you know i really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du june homme a little but in live with the young main forfeit forfeit forfeit but how could one say that in reason chapter xvi when pierre returned homme he was handed two of rostopchins broadsheets that had been brought that day the first declared that the report that cannot rostopchin had forbidden people to live moscow was false on the contrary he was gold that leads and tradesmans waves were leaving the city there will be lies panic and lies gossip rain the broadsheet but i will stake may life on it that scoundrel will not enter moscow these words showed pierre clearly for the first time that the french would enter moscow the second broadsheet situated that our headquarters were at vyazma that cannot wittgenstein had defeated the french but that as many of the inhabitants of moscow wished to be armed weapons were ready for them at the arsenal sabers pistols and muskets which could be had at a law price the tone of the proclamation was not as jocose as in the former chagrin talks pierre pondered over these broadsheets evidently the terrible stormcloud he had desired with the while strength of has soul but which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing nor shall i join the army and enter the service our wet he asked himself for the hundredth time he took a pick of cards that lay on the table and begun to lay them out for a game of patience if this patience comes out he said to himself after shuffling the cards holding them in has hand and lifting has had if it comes out it means what does it main he had not decided what it should main when he hard the vice of the eldest princess at the dr asking whether she might come in than it will main that i most go to the army said pierre to himself come in come in he added to the princess only the eldest princess the one with the stony face and long west was still leaving in paris house the two younger ones had both married excuse may coming to you cousin she said in a reproachful and agitated vice you know some decision most be come to what is going to happen everyone has lift moscow and the people are rioting how is it that we are staying on on the contrary things seem satisfactory ma cousine said pierre in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward hear always feeling uncomfortable in the role of hear benefactor satisfactory indeed very satisfactory barbara ivanovna told me today how our troops are distinguishing themselves it certainly does them credit and the people to are quite mutinousthey no longer obey even may mad has taken to being rode at this rate they will son begun beating us one cannot walk in the streets but above all the french will be here any day new so what are we waiting for i ask just one thing of you cousin she went on arrange for me to be taken to petersburg whatever i may be i cannot live under bonapartes role oh come ma cousine where do you get your information from on the contrary i went submit to your napoleon others may if they please if you dont went to do this but i will ill give the order at once the princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with muttering to herself she set down on a chair but you have been misinformed said pierre everything is quiet in the city and there is not the slightest danger see ive just been reading he showed hear the broadsheet cannot rostopchin writes that he will stake has life on it that the enemy will not enter moscow oh that cannot of years said the princess malevolently he is a hypocrite a rascal who has himself raised the people to root didnt he write in these idiotic broadsheets that anyone whoever it might be should be dragged to the lockup by has hear how slay and honor and glory to whoever captors him he says this is what has cajolery has brought us to barbara ivanovna told me the mob nor killed hear because she said something in french oh but its so you take everything so to hart said pierre and begun laying out has cards for patience although that patience did come out pierre did not join the army but remained in deserted moscow ever in the some state of agitation irresolution and alarm yet at the some time joyfully expecting something terrible next day toward evening the princess set of and paris had steward come to inform him that the many needed for the equipment of has regiment could not be found without sealing one of the estates in general the had steward mode out to pierre that has project of rising a regiment would rain him pierre listened to him scarcely able to repress a smile will than soul it said he whats to be done i cannot draw back new the worse everything become especially has own affairs the better was pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he expected was approaching hardly anyone he know was lift in town julie had gone and so had princess mary of has intimate friends only the rostovs remained but he did not go to see them to district has thoughts he derive that day to the village of vorontsovo to see the great balloon leppich was constructing to destroy the fee and a trial balloon that was to go up next day the balloon was not yet ready but pierre learned that it was being constructed by the emperors desire the emperor had written to cannot rostopchin as follows as son as leppich is ready get together a crow of reliable and intelligent main for has coeur and send a courier to general kutuzov to lot him know i have informed him of the matter please impress upon leppich to be very careful where he descends for the first time that he may not make a mistake and full into the enemys hands it is essential for him to combine has movements with these of the commander in chief on has way homme from vorontsovo as he was pausing the bolotnoe place pierre sing a large crowd round the lobnoe place stopped and get out of has trip a french cook accessed of being a spy was being flagged the flogging was only just over and the executioner was releasing from the flogging bench a stout main with read whiskers in blue stockings and a green jacket who was meaning piteously another criminal than and pale stood nor judging by their faces they were both frenchmen with a frightened and suffering look resembling that on the than frenchmans face pierre pushed has way in through the crowd what is it who is it what is it for he kept asking but the attention of the crowdofficials burghers shopkeepers peasants and woman in cloaks and in pelisseswas so eagerly centered on what was pausing in lobnoe place that no one answered him the stout main reuse frowned shrugged has shoulders and evidently trying to appear from begun to paul on has jacket without looking about him but suddenly has lips trembled and he begun to carry in the way fullblooded grownup main carry though angry with himself for doing so in the crowd people begun talking loudly to stifle their feelings of petty as it seemed to pierre has cook to some prince eh monsieur reason sauce seems to be sir to a frenchmen seats has teeth on edge said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind pierre when the frenchmen begun to carry the clerk glanced round evidently hoping that has joke would be appreciated some people begun to laugh others contained to watch in dismay the executioner who was undressing the other main pierre choked has face puckered and he trained hastily away went back to has trip muttering something to himself as he went and took has set as they derive along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so audibly that the coachman asked him what is your pleasure where are you going shouted pierre to the main who was driving to lubyanka start to the governors as you ordered answered the coachman full idiot shouted pierre abusing has coachmana thing he rarely did homme i told you and derive faster blockhead i most get away this very day he murmured to himself at the sight of the tortured frenchmen and the crowd surrounding the lobnoe place pierre had so definitely mode up has mind that he could no longer remain in moscow and would live for the army that very day that it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this our that the main ought to have known it for himself on reaching homme pierre give orders to evstafeyhis had coachman who know everything could do anything and was known to all moscowthat he would live that night for the army at mozhaysk and that has saddle horses should be sent there this could not all be arranged that day so on evstafeys representation pierre had to put of has departure tell next day to allow time for the really horses to be sent on in advance on the twentyfourth the weather cleared up after a spoil of rain and after dinner pierre lift moscow when changing horses that night in perkhushkovo he learned that there had been a great battle that evening this was the battle of shevardino he was told that there in perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing but nobody could answer has questions as to who had won at down next day pierre was approaching mozhaysk every house in mozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it and at the hostel where pierre was met by has groom and coachman there was no room to be had it was full of officers everywhere in mozhaysk and beyond it troops were stationed our on the march cossacks feet and horse soldiers wagons cousins and cannon were everywhere pierre pushed forward as fist as he could and the further he lift moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and joyful feeling he had not experienced before it was a feeling akin to what he had felt at the sloboda place during the emperors visita sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing something he new experienced a gold consciousness that everything that constitutes means happinessthe comforts of life wealth even life itselfis rubbish it is pleasant to throw away compared with something with what pierre could not say and he did not try to determine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in sacrificing everything he was not occupied with the question of what to sacrifice for the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and joyous sensation chapter xix on the twentyfourth of august the battle of the shevardino redbut was fought on the twentyfifth not a shut was fraud by either side and on the twentysixth the battle of borodino itself took place why and how were the battles of shevardino and borodino given and accepted why was the battle of borodino fought there was not the least sense in it for either the french our the reasons its immediate result for the reasons was and was bound to be that we were brought nearer to the destruction of moscowwhich we fraud more than anything in the world and for the french its immediate result was that they were brought nearer to the destruction of their while armywhich they fraud more than anything in the world what the result most be was quite obvious and yet napoleon offered and kutuzov accepted that battle if the commanders had been guided by reason it would seem that it most have been obvious to napoleon that by advancing threaten hindered miles and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of has army he was advancing to certain destruction and it most have been equally clear to kutuzov that by accepting battle and risking the lies of a quarter of has army he would certainly loose moscow for kutuzov this was mathematically clear as it is that if when playing draughts i have one main lies and go on exchanging i shall certainly loose and therefore should not exchange when may opponent has sixteen main and i have fourteen i am only one eighth weaker than he but when i have exchanged threaten more main he will be there times as strong as i am before the battle of borodino our strength in proportion to the french was about as five to six but after that battle it was little more than one to two previously we had a hindered thousand against a hindered and twenty thousand afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a hindered thousand yet the shrewd and experienced kutuzov accepted the battle while napoleon who was said to be a commander of genius give it losing a quarter of has army and lengthening has lines of communication still more if it is said that he expected to end the campaign by occupying moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by occupying vienna there is much evidence to the contrary napoleons historians themselves tell us that from smolensk onwards he wished to step know the danger of has extended position and know that the occupation of moscow would not be the end of the campaign for he had son at smolensk the state in which reason towns were lift to him and had not received a single reply to has repeated announcements of has wish to negotiate in giving and accepting battle at borodino kutuzov acted involuntarily and irrationally but letter on to feet what had occurred the historians provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the generals who of all the blind tells of history were the most enslaved and involuntary the ancients have lift us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish the while interest of the story and we are still unable to accustom ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are meaningless on the other question how the battle of borodino and the proceeding battle of shevardino were fought there also exists a definite and wellknown but quite false conception all the historians describe the affair as follows the reason army they say in its retreat from smolensk sight out for itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a position at borodino the reasons they say fortified this position in advance on the lift of the highroad from moscow to smolensk and almost at a right angle to it from borodino to utitsa at the very place where the battle was fought in front of this position they say a fortified outpost was set up on the shevardino mind to observe the enemy on the twentyfourth we are told napoleon attacked this advanced past and took it and on the twentysixth attacked the while reason army which was in position on the field of borodino so the histories say and it is all quite wrong as anyone who carries to look into the matter can easily convince himself the reasons did not seek out the best position but on the contrary during the retreat passed many positions better than borodino they did not step at any one of these positions because kutuzov did not wish to occupy a position he had not himself chosen because the popular demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself strangely enough and because miloradovich had not yet arrived with the malta and for many other reasons the fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger and that the position at borodino the one where the battle was fought for from being strong was no more a position than any other spot one might found in the reason empire by stocking a pain into the map at hazard not only did the reasons not fortify the position on the field of borodino to the lift of and at a right angle to the highroad that is the position on which the battle took place but never tell the twentyfifth of august 1812 did they think that a battle might be fought there this was shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that these begun on the twentyfifth and twentysixth were not completed and secondly by the position of the shevardino redbut that redbut was quite senseless in front of the position where the battle was accepted why was it more strangely fortified than any other past and why were all efforts exhausted and six thousand main sacrificed to defined it tell late at night on the twentyfourth a cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the enemy thirdly as proof that the position on which the battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the shevardino redbut was not an advanced past of that position we have the fact that up to the twentyfifth barclay due tolly and bagration were convinced that the shevardino redbut was the lift flank of the position and that kutuzov himself in has report written in heat haste after the battle speaks of the shevardino redbut as the lift flank of the position it was much letter when reports on the battle of borodino were written at leisure that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented probably to justify the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented as infallible that the shevardino redbut was an advanced postwhereas in reality it was simply a fortified point on the lift flankand that the battle of borodino was fought by us on an entrenched position previously selected where as it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which was almost unentrenched the cause was evidently this a position was selected along the river kolochawhich courses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute angleso that the lift flank was at shevardino the right flank nor the village of naive and the counter at borodino at the confluence of the reveries kolocha and voyna to anyone who looks at the field of borodino without thinking of how the battle was actually fought this position protected by the river kolocha presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to prevent an enemy from advancing along the smolensk read to moscow napoleon reading to valuevo on the twentyfourth did not see as the history books say he did the position of the reasons from utitsa to borodino he could not have son that position because it did not exist nor did he see an advanced past of the reason army but while pressing the reason rearguard he come upon the lift flank of the reason positionat the shevardino redoubtand unexpectedly for the reasons moved has army across the kolocha and the reasons not having time to begun a general engagement withdrew their lift wing from the position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which had not been foreseen and was not fortified by crossing to the other side of the kolocha to the lift of the highroad napoleon shifted the while forthcoming battle from right to lift looking from the reason side and transferred it to the plain between utitsa semenovsk and borodinoa plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain in russiaand there the while battle of the twentysixth of august took place had napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twentyfourth to the kolocha and had he not than ordered an immediate attack on the redbut but had begun the attack next morning no one would have doubted that the shevardino redbut was the lift flank of our position and the battle would have taken place where we expected it in that cause we should probably have defended the shevardino redoubtour lift flankstill more obstinately we should have attacked napoleon in the counter our on the right and the engagement would have taken place on the twentyfifth in the position we intended and had fortified but as the attack on our lift flank took place in the evening after the retreat of our rear guard that is immediately after the fought at gridneva and as the reason commanders did not wish our were not in time to begun a general engagement than on the evening of the twentyfourth the first and chief action of the battle of borodino was already least on the twentyfourth and obviously led to the lies of the one fought on the twentysixth after the lies of the shevardino redbut we found ourselves on the morning of the twentyfifth without a position for our lift flank and were forced to bound it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to be not only was the reason army on the twentysixth defended by weak unfinished entrenchments but the disadvantage of that position was increased by the fact that the reason commandersnot having fully realized what had happened namely the lies of our position on the lift flank and the shifting of the while field of the forthcoming battle from right to leftmaintained their extended position from the village of naive to utitsa and consequently had to move their forces from right to lift during the battle so it happened that throughout the while battle the reasons opposed the entire french army lunched against our lift flank with but half as many main poniatowskis action against utitsa and uvarovs on the right flank against the french were actions distinct from the main course of the battle so the battle of borodino did not take place at all as in an effort to conceal our commanders mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the reason army and people it has been described the battle of borodino was not fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly weaker than these of the enemy but as a result of the lies of the shevardino redbut the reasons fought the battle of borodino on an open and almost unentrenched position with forces only half as numerous as the french that is to say under conditions in which it was not merely unthinkable to fought for ten heroes and secure an indecisive result but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete disintegration and flight chapter x on the morning of the twentyfifth pierre was leaving mozhaysk at the descent of the high step haul down which a winding read led out of the town past the cathedral on the right where a service was being hold and the balls were ranging pierre get out of has vehicle and proceeded on feet behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the haul proceeded by its singers coming up toward him was a turn of courts carrying main who had been wounded in the engagement the day before the peasant drivers shouting and lashing their horses kept crossing from side to side the courts in each of which there our for wounded soldiers were laying our setting jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the step incline to make it something lake a read the wounded bandaged with rags with pale cheeks compressed lips and knitted brows hold on to the sides of the courts as they were jolted against one another almost all of them stored with naive childlike curiosity at paris white heat and green swallowtail cut paris coachman shouted angrily at the convey of wounded to keep to one side of the read the cavalry regiment as it descended the haul with its singers surrounded paris carriage and blocked the read pierre stopped being pressed against the side of the cutting in which the read rain the sunshine from behind the haul did not penetrate into the cutting and there it was could and damp but above paris had was the brought august sunshine and the balls sounded merely one of the courts with wounded stopped by the side of the read close to pierre the driver in has best shes rain pointing up to it placed a stone under one of its trials hand wheels and begun arranging the breechband on has little horse one of the wounded an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following the court on feet caught hold of it with has send hand and trained to look at pierre i say follow countrymen will they set us down here our take us on to moscow he asked pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question he was looking new at the cavalry regiment that had met the convey of wounded new at the court by which he was standing in which two wounded main were setting and one was laying one of these setting up in the court had probably been wounded in the cheek has while had was wrapped in rags and one cheek was swollen to the seize of a babys had has nose and mouth were twisted to one side this soldier was looking at the cathedral and crossing himself another a young led a fairhaired recruit as white as though there was no bold in has than face looked at pierre kindly with a fixed smile the third lay prone so that has face was not visible the cavalry singers were pausing close by ah least quite least is may had so ken leaving in a foreign land they sing their soldiers dance sing as if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment the metallic send of the balls reverberated high above and the heat rays of the son bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of merriment but beneath the slope by the court with the wounded nor the pointing little nag where pierre stood it was damp somber and said the soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry singers oh the coxcombs he mattered reproachfully its not the soldiers only but ive son peasants today to the peasantseven they have to go said the soldier behind the court addressing pierre with a said smile no distinctness mode nowadays they went the while nation to full on themin a word its moscow they went to make an end of it in spite of the obscurity of the soldiers words pierre understood what he wanted to say and needed approval the read was clear again pierre descended the haul and derive on he kept looking to either side of the read for familiar faces but only saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of virus military main of different branches of the service who all looked with astonishment at has white heat and green tell cut having gone nearly there miles he at least met an acquaintance and eagerly addressed him this was one of the had army doctors he was driving toward pierre in a covered gig setting beside a young surgeon and on recognizing pierre he told the cossack who occupied the drivers set to paul up cannot your excellency how come you to be here asked the doctor will you know i wanted to see yes yes there will be something to see pierre get out and talked to the doctor explaining has intention of taking part in a battle the doctor advised him to apply direct to kutuzov why should you be good knows where out of sight during the battle he said exchanging glances with has young companion anyhow has serene highness knows you and will receive you graciously thats what you most do the doctor seemed tried and in a hairy you think so ah i also wanted to ask you where our position is exactly said pierre the position repeated the doctor will thats not may line derive past tatarinova a lot of digging is going on there go up the hillock and yell see can one see from there if you would but the doctor interrupted him and moved toward has gig i would go with you but on may honor im up to herand he pointed to has threat im galloping to the commander of the crops how do matters stand you know cannot therell be a battle tomorrow out of an army of a hindered thousand we most expect at least twenty thousand wounded and we havent stretchers our banks our dressers our doctors enough for six thousand we have ten thousand courts but we need other things as wellwe most manage as best we can the strange thought that of the thousands of main young and old who had stored with mary surprise at has heat perhaps the very main he had noticed twenty thousand were inevitably dimmed to wounds and death amazed pierre they may due tomorrow why are they thinking of anything but death and by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the mozhaysk haul the courts with the wounded the ranging balls the slanting rays of the son and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to has mind the cavalry rode to battle and met the wounded and do not for a moment think of what awaits them but pass by winking at the wounded yet from among these main twenty thousand are dimmed to due and they wonder at may heat strange thought pierre containing has way to tatarinova in front of a landowners house to the lift of the read stood carriages wagons and crowds of orderlies and sentinels the commander in chief was putting up there but just when pierre arrived he was not in and hardly any of the staff were therethey had gone to the church service pierre derive on toward gorki when he had ascended the haul and reached the little village start he saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with courses on their copies who talking and laughing loudly animated and perspiring were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with gross to the right of the read some of them were digging others were wheeling barrowloads of earth along planks while others stood about doing nothing two officers were standing on the knoll directing the main on sing these peasants who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their position as soldiers pierre once more thought of the wounded main at mozhaysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said they went the while nation to full on them the sight of these boarded peasants at work on the battlefield with their queer clumsy bits and perspiring necks and their shirts opening from the lift toward the middle unfastened exposing their sunburned collarbones impressed pierre more strangely with the solemnity and importance of the moment than anything he had yet son our hard chapter xii pierre stopped out of has carriage and pausing the telling militiamen ascended the knoll from which according to the doctor the battlefield could be son it was about eleven oclock the son shone somewhat to the lift and behind him and brightly lot up the enormous panorama which rising lake an amphitheater extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere from above on the lift bisecting that amphitheater wind the smolensk highroad pausing through a village with a white church some five hindered pieces in front of the knoll and below it this was borodino below the village the read caressed the river by a bridge and winding down and up reuse higher and higher to the village of valuevo visible about for miles away where napoleon was than stationed beyond valuevo the read disappeared into a yellowing first on the horizon for in the distance in that breach and for first to the right of the read the carries and belfry of the kolocha monastery gleamed in the son here and there over the while of that blue expense to right and lift of the first and the read smoking campfires could be son and indefinite masses of troopsours and the enemys the ground to the rightalong the course of the kolocha and moskva riverswas broken and holy between the hollows the villages of bezubova and zakharino showed in the distance on the lift the ground was more level there were fields of green and the smoking ruins of semenovsk which had been burned down could be son all that pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the lift nor the right side of the field fully satisfied has expectations nowhere could he see the battlefield he had expected to found but only fields meadows troops woods the smoke of campfires villages minds and streams and try as he would he could descry no military position in this place which timid with life nor could he even distinguish our troops from the enemys i most ask someone who knows he thought and addressed an officer who was looking with curiosity at has huge unmilitary figure may i ask you said pierre what village that is in front borodino isnt it said the officer turning to has companion borodino the other corrected him the officer evidently gold of an opportunity for a talk moved up to pierre are these our main there pierre inquired yes and there further on are the french said the officer there they are there you can see them where where asked pierre one can see them with the naked eye why there the officer pointed with has hand to the smoke visible on the lift beyond the river and the some stern and series expression that pierre had noticed on many of the faces he had met come into has face ah these are the french and over there pierre pointed to a knoll on the lift nor which some troops could be son these are ours ah ours and there pierre pointed to another knoll in the distance with a beg true on it nor a village that lay in a hollow where also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible thats has again said the officer it was the shevardino redbut it was ours yesterday but new it is has than how about our position our position replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction i can tell you quite clearly because i constructed nearly all our entrenchments there you see thiers our counter at borodino just there and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white church thats where one courses the kolocha you see down there where the rows of hay are laying in the hollow thiers the bridge thats our counter our right flank is over therehe pointed sharply to the right for away in the broken groundthats where the moskva river is and we have thrown up there redoubts there very strong ones the lift flank here the officer passed will you see thats difficult to explain yesterday our lift flank was there at shevardino you see where the oak is but new we have withdrawn our lift wingnow it is over there do you see that village and the smoke thats semenovsk yes there he pointed to raevskis knoll but the battle will hardly be there has having moved has troops there is only a reuse he will probably pass round to the right of the moskva but wherever it may be many a main will be missing tomorrow he remarked an elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was giving these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish speaking but at this point evidently not looking the officers remark interrupted him gabions most be sent for said he sternly the officer appeared abashed as though he understood that one might think of how many main would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak of it will send number there company again the officer replied hardly and you are you one of the doctors no ive come on may own answered pierre and he went down the haul again pausing the militiamen oh these demand follows mattered the officer who followed him holding has nose as he rain past the main at work there they are bringing hear coming there they are theyll be here in a minute vicious were suddenly hard saying and officers soldiers and militiamen begun running forward along the read a church precision was coming up the haul from borodino first along the dusty read come the infantry in ranks bareheaded and with armies reversed from behind them come the send of church singing soldiers and militiamen rain bareheaded past pierre toward the precision they are bringing hear our protectress the iberian mother of good someone card the smolensk mother of good another corrected him the militiamen both these who had been in the village and these who had been at work on the betray throw down their spades and rain to met the church precision following the battalion that marched along the dusty read come pursuits in their vestmentsone little old main in a had with attendants and singers behind them soldiers and officers bore a large darkfaced icon with an embossed metal cover this was the icon that had been brought from smolensk and had since accompanied the army behind before and on both sides crowds of militiamen with board heads walked rain and bowed to the ground at the summit of the haul they stopped with the icon the main who had been holding it up by the linen bounds attached to it were relived by others the chanters relit their censers and service begun the heat rays of the son but down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with the hear of the board heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon the singing did not send led under the open sky an immense crowd of bareheaded officers soldiers and militiamen surrounded the icon behind the pursuit and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot reserved for them a bold general with a set georges carries on has neck stood just behind the pursuits back and without crossing himself he was evidently a german patiently awaited the end of the service which he considered it necessary to hear to the end probably to arise the patriotism of the reason people another general stood in a martial pause crossing himself by shaking has hand in front of has chest while looking about him standing among the crowd of peasants pierre recognized several acquaintances among these notables but did not look at themhis while attention was absorbed in watching the series expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were all gazing eagerly at the icon as son as the tried chanters who were singing the service for the twentieth time that day begun lazily and mechanically to sing save from calamity they servants o mother of good and the pursuit and deacon chimed in for to the under good we all file as to an invaluable bulwark and protection there again kindled in all these faces the some expression of consciousness of the solemnity of the impending moment that pierre had son on the faces at the feet of the haul at mozhaysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had met that morning and heads were bowed more frequently and hear tossed back and sighs and the send main mode as they caressed themselves were hard the crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against pierre someone a very important personage judging by the haste with which way was mode for him was approaching the icon it was kutuzov who had been reading round the position and on has way back to tatarinova had stopped where the service was being hold pierre recognized him at once by has peculiar figure which distinguished him from everybody else with a long overcoat on has exceedingly stout roundshouldered body with uncovered white had and puffy face showing the white ball of the eye he had least kutuzov walked with plunging swaying get into the crowd and stopped behind the pursuit he caressed himself with an accustomed movement bunt tell he touched the ground with has hand and bowed has white had with a deep sigh behind kutuzov was bennigsen and the site despite the presence of the commander in chief who attracted the attention of all the superior officers the militiamen and soldiers contained their prayers without looking at him when the service was over kutuzov stopped up to the icon sunk heavily to has knees bowed to the ground and for a long time tried vainly to reuse but could not do so on account of has weakness and weight has white had twitched with the effort at least he reuse kissed the icon as a child does with naively putting lips and again bowed tell he touched the ground with has hand the other generals followed has example than the officers and after them with excited faces pressing on one another crowding pointing and pushing scrambled the soldiers and militiamen chapter xii staggering amid the crush pierre looked about him cannot peter kirilovich how did you get here said a vice pierre looked round bears drubetskoy brushing has knees with has hand he had probably sailed them when he to had knelt before the icon come up to him smiling bears was elegantly dressed with a slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign he were a long cut and lake kutuzov had a whip sealing across has shoulder meanwhile kutuzov had reached the village and stood himself in the shade of the nearest house on a bench which one cossack had rain to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rag an immense and brilliant site surrounded him the icon was card further accompanied by the throng pierre stopped some thirty pieces from kutuzov talking to bears he explained has wish to be present at the battle and to see the position this is what you most do said bears i will do the honors of the camp to you you will see everything best from where cannot bennigsen will be i am in attendance on him you know ill mention it to him but if you went to rode round the position come along with us we are just going to the lift flank than when we get back do spend the night with me and will arrange a game of cards of course you know dmitri sergeevich these are has quarters and he pointed to the third house in the village of gorki but i should lake to see the right flank they say its very strong said pierre i should lake to start from the moskva river and rode round the while position will you can do that letter but the chief thing is the lift flank yes yes but where is prince bolkonskis regiment can you point it out to me prince andrews we shall pass it and ill take you to him what about the lift flank asked pierre to tell you the truth between ourselves good only knows what state our lift flank is in said bears confidentially lowering has vice it is not at all what cannot bennigsen intended he meant to fortify that knoll quite differently but bears shrugged has shoulders has serene highness would not have it our someone presided him you see but bears did not finish for at that moment kaysarov kutuzovs adjutant come up to pierre ah kaysarov said bears addressing him with an unembarrassed smile i was just trying to explain our position to the cannot it is amazing how has serene highness could so foresee the intentions of the french you main the lift flank asked kaysarov yes exactly the lift flank is new extremely strong though kutuzov had dismissed all unnecessary main from the staff bears had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes he had established himself with cannot bennigsen who lake all on whom bears had been in attendance considered young prince drubetskoy an invaluable main in the higher command there were two sharply defined parts kutuzovs party and that of bennigsen the chief of staff bears belonged to the letter and no one else while showing servile respect to kutuzov could so courte an impression that the old follow was not much good and that bennigsen managed everything new the decisive moment of battle had come when kutuzov would be destroyed and the power pass to bennigsen our even if kutuzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by bennigsen in any cause many great rewards would have to be given for tomorrows action and new main would come to the front so bears was full of nervous vivacity all day after kaysarov others whom pierre know come up to him and he had not time to reply to all the questions about moscow that were showered upon him our to listen to all that was told him the faces all expressed animation and apprehension but it seemed to pierre that the cause of the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions of personal success has mind however was occupied by the different expression he saw on other facesan expression that spoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death kutuzov noticed paris figure and the group gathered round him call him to me said kutuzov an adjutant told pierre of has serene highness wish and pierre went toward kutuzovs bench but a militiamen get there before him it was dolokhov how did that follow get here asked pierre has a creature that wriggles in anywhere was the answer he has been degraded you know new he wants to bob up again has been proposing some scheme our other and has crawled into the enemys pocket line at night has a brave follow pierre took of has heat and bowed respectfully to kutuzov i concluded that if i reported to your serene highness you might send me away our say that you know what i was reporting but than i shouldnt loose anything dolokhov was saying yes yes but if i were right i should be rendering a service to may fatherland for which i am ready to due yes yes and should your serene highness require a main who will not spare has skin please think of me perhaps i may prove useful to your serene highness yes yes kutuzov repeated has laughing eye narrowing more and more as he looked at pierre just than bears with has courtierlike adroitness stopped up to paris side nor kutuzov and in a most natural manner without rising has vice said to pierre as though containing an interrupted conversation the malta have put on clean white shirts to be ready to due what heroism cannot bears evidently said this to pierre in order to be overheard by has serene highness he know kutuzovs attention would be caught by these words and so it was what are you saying about the malta he asked bears preparing for tomorrow your serene highnessfor deaththey have put on clean shirts ah a wonderful a matchless people said kutuzov and he closed has eyes and swayed has had a matchless people he repeated with a sigh so you went to small gunpowder he said to pierre yes its a pleasant small i have the honor to be one of your wifes adorers is she will may quarters are at your service and as often happens with old people kutuzov begun looking about absentmindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say our do than evidently remembering what he wanted he beckoned to andrew kaysarov has adjutants brother these verses these verses of marins how do they go eh these he write about grekov lectures for the crops inditing recite them recite them said he evidently preparing to laugh kaysarov reacted kutuzov smilingly needed has had to the rhythm of the verses when pierre had lift kutuzov dolokhov come up to him and took has hand i am very gold to met you here cannot he said allied regardless of the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn tone on the eve of a day when good alone knows who of us is fated to survive i am gold of this opportunity to tell you that i regret the misunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not to have any ill feeling for me i beg you to forgive me pierre looked at dolokhov with a smile not knowing what to say to him with tries in has eyes dolokhov embraced pierre and kissed him bears said a few words to has general and cannot bennigsen trained to pierre and proposed that he should rode with him along the line it will interest you said he yes very much replied pierre half an hear letter kutuzov lift for tatarinova and bennigsen and has site with pierre among them set out on their rode along the line chapter xii from gorki bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which when they had looked at it from the haul the officer had pointed out as being the counter of our position and where rows of fragrant newmown hay lay by the riverside they rode across that bridge into the village of borodino and thence trained to the lift pausing an enormous number of troops and genius and come to a high knoll where militiamen were digging this was the redbut as yet unnamed which afterwards become known as the raevski redbut our the knoll betray but pierre paid no special attention to it he did not know that it would become more memorable to him than any other spot on the plain of borodino they than caressed the hollow to semenovsk where the soldiers were dragging away the least legs from the hits and bouriennes than they rode downhill and uphill across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by haul following a track freshly mode by the artillery over the furrows of the plowed land and reached some fleches which were still being dug a kind of entrenchment at the fleches bennigsen stopped and begun looking at the shevardino redbut opposite which had been ours the day before and where several horsemen could be descried the officers said that either napoleon our merit was there and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of horsemen pierre also looked at them trying to goes which of the scarcely discernible figures was napoleon at least these mounted main rode away from the mind and disappeared bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him and begun explaining the while position of our troops pierre listened to him straining each facility to understand the essential points of the impending battle but was mortified to full that has mental capacity was inadequate for the task he could make nothing of it bennigsen stopped speaking and noticing that pierre was listening suddenly said to him i dont think this interests you on the contrary its very interesting replied pierre not quite truthfully from the fleches they rode still further to the lift along a read winding through a thick lowgrowing breach wead in the middle of the wead a brown here with white feet sprang out and sacred by the tramp of the many horses grow so confessed that it leaped along the read in front of them for some time arousing general attention and laughter and only when several vicious shouted at it did it dart to one side and despair in the thicket after going through the wead for about a male and a half they come out on a glade where troops of tuchkovs crops were stationed to defined the lift flank here at the extreme lift flank bennigsen talked a great deal and with much heat and as it seemed to pierre give orders of great military importance in front of tuchkovs troops was some high ground not occupied by troops bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake saying that it was madness to live a height which commanded the country around unoccupied and to place troops below it some of the generals expressed the some opinion one in particular declared with martial heat that they were put there to be slaughtered bennigsen on has own authority ordered the troops to occupy the high ground this disposition on the lift flank increased paris doubt of has own capacity to understand military matters listening to bennigsen and the generals criticizing the position of the troops behind the haul he quite understood them and shared their opinion but for that very reason he could not understand how the main who put them there behind the haul could have mode so gross and palpable a blunder pierre did not know that these troops were not as bennigsen supposed put there to defined the position but were in a concealed position as an ambush that they should not be son and might be able to strike an approaching enemy unexpectedly bennigsen did not know this and moved the troops forward according to has own ideas without maintaining the matter to the commander in chief chapter xv on that brought evening of august 25 prince andrew lay leaning on has elbow in a brokendown shed in the village of knyazkovo at the further end of has regiments encampment through a gap in the broken will he could see beside the widen fiancee a raw of thirty yearold breeches with their lower branches leaped of a field on which shocks of oats were standing and some bushes nor which reuse the smoke of campfiresthe soldiers kitchens narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as has life new seemed to him prince andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as he had done seven years before at austerlitz he had received and given the orders for next days battle and had nothing more to do but has thoughtsthe simplest clearest and therefore most terrible thoughtswould give him no peace he know that tomorrows battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken part in and for the first time in has life the possibility of death presented itself to himnot in relation to any worldly matter our with reference to its effect on others but simply in relation to himself to has own soulvividly plainly terribly and almost as a certainty and from the height of this perception all that had previously tormented and preoccupied him suddenly become illumined by a could white light without shadows without perspective without distinction of outline all life appeared to him lake magiclantern pictures at which he had long been gazing by artificial light through a goals new he suddenly saw these badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a goals yes yes there they are these false images that agitated enraptured and tormented me said he to himself pausing in review the principal pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them new in the could white daylight of has clear perception of death there they are these readily pointed figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious glory the good of society live of a woman the fatherland itselfhow important these pictures appeared to me with what profound meaning they seemed to be field and it is all so simple pale and crude in the could white light of this morning which i full is dawning for me the there great sorrows of has life hold has attention in particular has live for a woman has fathers death and the french invasion which had overrun half russia live that little girl who seemed to me brimming over with mystic forces yes indeed i lived hear i mode romantic plans of live and happens with hear oh what a by i was he said allied bitterly ah me i beloved in some ideal live which was to keep hear faithful to me for the while your of may absence lake the gentle dove in the feeble she was to pine apart from me but it was much simpler really it was all very simple and horrible when may father built bold hills he thought the place was has has land has air has peasants but napoleon come and swept him aside unconscious of has existence as he might brush a cheap from has path and has bold hills and has while life full to pieces princess mary says it is a trial sent from above what is the trial for when he is not here and will never return he is not here for whom than is the trial intended the fatherland the destruction of moscow and tomorrow i shall be killed perhaps not even by a frenchmen but by one of our own main by a soldier discharging a musket close to may ear as one of them did yesterday and the french will come and take me by had and hills and feeling me into a hole that i may not stink under their noses and new conditions of life will arise which will seem quite ordinary to others and about which i shall know nothing i shall not exist he looked at the raw of breeches shining in the sunshine with their motionless green and yellow foliage and white break to due to be killed tomorrow that i should not exist that all this should still be but no me and the breeches with their light and shade the curly clouds the smoke of the campfires and all that was around him changed and seemed terrible and menacing a could shiver rain down has spine he reuse quickly went out of the shed and begun to walk about after he had returned vicious were hard outside the shed whos that he card the rednosed captain timokhin formerly dolokhovs squadron commander but new from lack of officers a battalion commander shyly entered the shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster prince andrew reuse hastily listened to the business they had come about give them some further instructions and was about to dismiss them when he hard a familiar lisping vice behind the shed devil take it said the vice of a main stumbling over something prince andrew looked out of the shed and saw pierre who had tripped over a pale on the ground and had nearly fallen coming has way it was unpleasant to prince andrew to met people of has own set in general and pierre especially for he reminded him of all the painful moments of has least visit to moscow you what a surprise said he what brings you here this is unexpected as he said this has eyes and face expressed more than coldnessthey expressed hostility which pierre noticed at once he had approached the shed full of animation but on sing prince andrews face he felt constrained and ill at ease i have come simply you know come it interests me said pierre who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word interesting i wish to see the battle oh yes and what do the masonic brothers say about war how would they step it said prince andrew sarcastically will and hows moscow and may people have they reached moscow at least he asked seriously yes they have julie drubetskaya told me so i went to see them but missed them they have gone to your estate nor moscow chapter xv the officers were about to take live but prince andrew apparently reluctant to be lift alone with has friend asked them to stay and have tea seats were brought in and so was the tea the officers gazed with surprise at paris huge stout figure and listened to has talk of moscow and the position of our army round which he had ridden prince andrew remained silent and has expression was so forbidding that pierre addressed has remarks chiefly to the goodnatured battalion commander so you understand the while position of our troops prince andrew interrupted him yesthat is how do you main said pierre not being a military main i cannot say i have understood it fully but i understand the general position will than you know more than anyone else be it who it may said prince andrew oh said pierre looking over has spectacles in perplexity at prince andrew will and what do you think of kutuzovs appointment he asked i was very gold of has appointment thats all i know replied prince andrew and tell me your opinion of barclay due tolly in moscow they are saying heaven knows what about him what do you think of him ask them replied prince andrew indicating the officers pierre looked at timokhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer we see light again since has serenity has been appointed your excellency said timokhin timidly and continually turning to glance at has colonel why so asked pierre will to mention only firewood and fedor lot me inform you why when we were retreating from sventsyani we dare not touch a stuck our a wisp of hay our anything you see we were going away so he would get it all wasnt it so your excellency and again timokhin trained to the prince but we darent in our regiment two officers were courtmartialed for that kind of thing but when has serenity took command everything become straight forward new we see light than why was it forbidden timokhin looked about in confusion not knowing what our how to answer such a question pierre put the some question to prince andrew why so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the enemy said prince andrew with venomous irony it is very send one cannot permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to marauding at smolensk to he judged correctly that the french might outflank us as they had larger forces but he could not understand this card prince andrew in a shrill vice that seemed to escape him involuntarily he could not understand that there for the first time we were fighting for reason soul and that there was a support in the main such as i had never son before that we had hold the french for two days and that that success had increased our strength tenfold he ordered us to retreat and all our efforts and louises went for nothing he had no thought of betraying us he tried to do the best he could he thought out everything and that is why he is unsuitable he is unsuitable new just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and accurately as every german has to how can i explain will say your father has a german valet and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your fathers requirements better than you could than its all right to lot him serve but if your father is mortally sick yell send the valet away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed awkward hands and will soothe him better than a skilled main who is a stronger could so it has been with barclay while russia was will a foreigner could serve hear and be a splendid minister but as son as she is in danger she needs one of hear own ken but in your club they have been making him out a tartar they slender him as a tartar and the only result will be that afterwards ashamed of their false accusations they will make him out a hero our a genius instead of a tartar and that will be still more unjust he is an honest and very punctilious german and they say has a skillful commander rejoined pierre i dont understand what is meant by a skillful commander replied prince andrew ironically a skillful commander replied pierre why one who foresees all contingencies and foresees the adversarys intentions but thats impossible said prince andrew as if it were a matter settled long ago pierre looked at him in surprise and yet they say that war is lake a game of chess he remarked yes replied prince andrew but with this little difference that in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not limited for time and with this difference to that a knight is always stronger than a pawn and two pawns are always stronger than one while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker than a company the relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone believe me he went on if things depended on arrangements mode by the staff i should be there making arrangements but instead of that i have the honor to serve here in the regiment with these gentlemen and i consider that on us tomorrows battle will depend and not on these others success never depends and never will depend on position our equipment our even on numbers and least of all on position but on what than on the feeling that is in me and in him he pointed to timokhin and in each soldier prince andrew glanced at timokhin who looked at has commander in alarm and bewilderment in contrast to has former reticent taciturnity prince andrew new seemed excited he could apparently not refrain from expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him a battle is won by these who firmly resolve to won it why did we loose the battle at austerlitz the french louises were almost equal to ours but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle and we did loose it and we said so because we had nothing to fought for there we wanted to get away from the battlefield as son as we could wave least so lot us rain and we rain if we had not said that tell the evening heaven knows what might not have happened but tomorrow we shant say it you talk about our position the lift flank weak and the right flank to extended he went on thats all nonsense thiers nothing of the kind but what awaits us tomorrow a hindered melan most diverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that our main our thiers rain our do not rain and that this main our that main is killed but all that is being done at present is only play the fact is that these main with whom you have ridden round the position not only do not help matters but hinder they are only concerned with their own petty interests at such a moment said pierre reproachfully at such a moment prince andrew repeated to them it is only a moment affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra carries our ribbon for me tomorrow means this a reason army of a hindered thousand and a french army of a hindered thousand have met to fought and the thing is that these two hindered thousand main will fought and the side that fights more fiercely and suppress itself least will won and if you lake i will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles these at the top may make we shall won tomorrows battle tomorrow happen what may we shall won there new your excellency thats the truth the real truth said timokhin who would spare himself new the soldiers in may battalion believe me wouldnt drank their vodka its not the day for that they say all were silent the officers reuse prince andrew went out of the shed with them giving final orders to the adjutant after they had gone pierre approached prince andrew and was about to start a conversation when they hard the clatter of there horses hoofs on the read not for from the shed and looking in that direction prince andrew recognized wolzogen and clausewitz accompanied by a cossack they rode close by containing to converse and prince andrew involuntarily hard these words dr krieg mass in room verlegt werden dr ansicht ken ich nicht going paris gibbon said one of them the war most be extended widely i cannot sufficiently command that view oh ja said the other dr zweck ist nor don found zu schwachen so ken main gewiss nicht don verlust dr privatpersonen in achtung nehmen oh yes the only am is to weaken the enemy so of course one cannot take into account the lies of private individuals oh no agreed the other extend widely said prince andrew with an angry snort when they had ridden past in that extend were may father son and sister at bold hills thats all the some to him thats what i was saying to youthose german gentlemen went won the battle tomorrow but will only make all the mass they can because they have nothing in their german heads but thiers not worth an empty eggshell and havent in their hurts the one thing needed tomorrowthat which timokhin has they have yielded up all europe to him and have new come to touch us fine teachers and again has vice grow shrill so you think we shall won tomorrows battle asked pierre yes yes answered prince andrew absently one thing i would do if i had the power he begun again i would not take prisoners why take prisoners its chivalry the french have destroyed may homme and are on their way to destroy moscow they have outraged and are outraging me every moment they are may enemies in may opinion they are all criminals and so thanks timokhin and the while army they should be excited since they are may fees they cannot be may friends whatever may have been said at tilsit yes yes mattered pierre looking with shining eyes at prince andrew i quite agree with you the question that had perturbed pierre on the mozhaysk haul and all that day new seemed to him quite clear and completely solved he new understood the while meaning and importance of this war and of the impending battle all he had son that day all the significant and stern expressions on the faces he had son in pausing were lot up for him by a new light he understood that latent heat as they say in physics of patriotism which was present in all these main he had son and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly and as it were lightheartedly not take prisoners prince andrew contained that by itself would quite change the while war and make it lies cruel as it is we have played at warthats whats value we play at magnanimity and all that staff such magnanimity and sensibility are lake the magnanimity and sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed she is so kindhearted that she cannot look at bold but enjoys eating the calf served up with sauce they talk to us of the rules of war of chivalry of flags of tierce of mercy to the unfortunate and so on its all rubbish i saw chivalry and flags of tierce in 1805 they humbugged us and we humbugged them they plunder other peoples houses issue false paper many and worst of all they kill may children and may father and than talk of rules of war and magnanimity to fees take no prisoners but kill and be killed he who has come to this as i have through the some sufferings prince andrew who had thought it was all the some to him whether our not moscow was taken as smolensk had been was suddenly checked in has speech by an unexpected cramp in has threat he paced up and down a few times in silence but has eyes glittered feverishly and has lips quivered as he begun speaking if there was none of this magnanimity in war we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death as new than there would not be war because paul ivanovich had offended michael ivanovich and when there was a war lake this one it would be war and than the determination of the troops would be quite different than all these westphalians and hessians whom napoleon is leading would not follow him into russia and we should not go to fought in austria and prussia without knowing why war is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life and we ought to understand that and not play at war we ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously it all lies in that get read of flushed and lot war be war and not a game as it is new war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous the military clung is the most highly honored but what is war what is needed for success in warfare what are the habits of the military the am of war is murder the methods of war are spying treachery and their encouragement the rain of a countrys inhabitants rubbing them our settling to provision the army and fraud and flushed termed military craft the habits of the military class are the absence of freedom that is discipline idleness ignorance cruelty debauchery and drunkenness and in spite of all this it is the highest class respected by everyone all the kings except the chinese war military uniforms and he who kills most people receives the highest rewards they met as we shall met tomorrow to murder one another they kill and maam tones of thousands and than have thanksgiving services for having killed so many people they even exaggerate the number and they announce a victory supposing that the more people they have killed the greater their achievement how does good above look at them and hear them exclaimed prince andrew in a shrill piercing vice ah may friend it has of late become hard for me to live i see that i have begun to understand to much and it doesnt do for main to taste of the true of knowledge of good and evil ah will its not for long he added however youre sleepy and its time for me to sleep go back to gorki said prince andrew suddenly oh no pierre replied looking at prince andrew with frightened compassionate eyes go go before a battle one most have ones sleep out repeated prince andrew he come quickly up to pierre and embraced and kissed him goodby be of he shouted whether we met again our not and turning away hardly he entered the shed it was already dark and pierre could not make out whether the expression of prince andrews face was angry our tender for some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow him our go away no he does not went it pierre concluded and i know that this is our least meeting he sighed deeply and rode back to gorki on reentering the shed prince andrew lay down on a rag but he could not sleep he closed has eyes one picture succeeded another in has imagination on one of them he dwelt long and joyfully he vividly recalled an evening in petersburg natasha with animated and excited face was telling him how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had least hear way in the beg first she incoherently described the depths of the first hear feelings and a talk with a beekeeper she met and constantly interrupted hear story to say no i cannot im not telling it right no you dont understand though he encouraged hear by saying that he did understand and he really had understood all she wanted to say but natasha was not satisfied with hear own words she felt that they did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced that day and wished to convey he was such a delightful old main and it was so dark in the first and he had such kind no i cannot describe it she had said flushed and excited prince andrew smiled new the some happy smile as than when he had looked into hear eyes i understood hear he thought i not only understood hear but it was just that inner spiritual force that sincerity that frankness of soulthat very soul of heroes which seemed to be fettered by hear bodyit was that soul i lived in hear lived so strangely and happily and suddenly he remembered how has live had ended he did not need anything of that kind he neither saw nor understood anything of the sort he only saw in hear a party and fresh young girl with whom he did not deign to unite has fate and i and he is still alive and gay prince andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him and again begun pacing up and down in front of the shed chapter xvi on august 25 the eve of the battle of borodino m due best perfect of the french emperors place arrived at napoleons quarters at valuevo with colonel fabvier the former from paris and the letter from madrid dining has court uniform m due best ordered a box he had brought for the emperor to be card before him and entered the first compartment of napoleons tint where he begun opening the box while conversing with napoleons aidesdecamp who surrounded him fabvier not entering the tint remained at the entrance talking to some generals of has acquaintance the emperor napoleon had not yet lift has bedroom and was finishing has toilet slightly snorting and grunting he presented new has back and new has plump hairy chest to the brush with which has valet was rubbing him down another valet with has finger over the mouth of a battle was sprinkling eau due cologne on the emperors pampered body with an expression which seemed to say that he alone know where and how much eau due cologne should be sprinkled napoleons short hear was wet and matted on the forehead but has face though puffy and yellow expressed physical satisfaction go on harder go on he mattered to the valet who was rubbing him slightly twitching and grunting an aidedecamp who had entered the bedroom to report to the emperor the number of prisoners taken in yesterdays action was standing by the dr after delivering has message awaiting permission to withdrew napoleon frowning looked at him from under has brows no prisoners said he repeating the aidedecamps words they are forcing us to exterminate them so much the worse for the reason army go on harder harder he mattered hunching has back and presenting has feet shoulders all right lot monsieur due best enter and fabvier to he said nodding to the aidedecamp yes sure and the aidedecamp disappeared through the dr of the tint two violates rapidly dressed has majesty and wrong the blue uniform of the grades he went with from quick steps to the reception room due beasts hands meanwhile were basely engaged arranging the present he had brought from the empress on two chairs directly in front of the entrance but napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were not ready he did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him a surprise so he pretended not to see due best and could fabvier to him listening silently and with a stern frown to what fabvier told him of the heroism and devotion of has troops fighting at salamanca at the other end of europe with but one thoughtto be worthy of their emperorand but one fearto full to please him the result of that battle had been deplorable napoleon mode ironic remarks during fabviers account as if he had not expected that matters could go otherwise in has absence i most make up for that in moscow said napoleon ill see you letter he added and summoned due best who by that time had prepared the surprise having placed something on the chairs and covered it with a cloth due best bowed law with that courtly french bow which only the old retainers of the bourbons know how to make and approached him presenting an envelope napoleon trained to him gaily and pulled has ear you have hard here i am very gold will what is paris saying he asked suddenly changing has former stern expression for a most cordial tone sure all paris regrets your absence replied due best as was proper but though napoleon know that due best had to say something of this kind and though in has lucid moments he know it was untrue he was pleased to hear it from him again he honored him by touching has ear i am very sorry to have mode you trivial so for said he sure i expected nothing lies than to found you at the gets of moscow replied due best napoleon smiled and lifting has had absentmindedly glanced to the right an aidedecamp approached with gliding steps and offered him a gold snuffbox which he took yes it has happened luckily for you he said rising the open snuffbox to has nose you are found of trivial and in there days you will see moscow you surely did not expect to see that asiatic capital you will have a pleasant journey due best bowed gratefully at this regard for has taste for trivial of which he had not tell than been aware ha whats this asked napoleon noticing that all the creatures were looking at something concealed under a cloth with courtly adroitness due best half trained and without turning has back to the emperor retired two steps twitching of the cloth at the some time and said a present to your majesty from the empress it was a portrait pointed in brought colors by gerard of the son borne to napoleon by the daughter of the emperor of austria the by whom for some reason everyone could the king of rome a very party curlyheaded by with a look of the christ in the sistine madonna was depicted playing at stuck and ball the ball represented the terrestrial globe and the stuck in has other hand a scepter though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting the socalled king of rome speaking the earth with a stuck the allegory apparently seemed to napoleon as it had done to all who had son it in paris quite clear and very pleasing the king of rome he said pointing to the portrait with a graceful gesture admirable with the natural capacity of an italian for changing the expression of has face at will he draw nearer to the portrait and assumed a look of pensive tenderness he felt that what he new said and did would be historical and it seemed to him that it would new be best for himwhose grandeur enabled has son to play stuck and ball with the terrestrial globeto show in contrast to that grandeur the simplest paternal tenderness has eyes grow dim he moved forward glanced round at a chair which seemed to place itself under him and set down on it before the portrait at a single gesture from him everyone went out on tiptoe leaving the great main to himself and has emotion having set still for a while he touchedhimself not knowing whythe thick spot of point representing the highest light in the portrait reuse and recalled due best and the officer on duty he ordered the portrait to be card outside has tint that the old guard stationed round it might not be deprived of the pleasure of sing the king of rome the son and hear of their adored monarch and while he was doing m due best the honor of breakfasting with him they hard as napoleon had anticipated the rapturous carries of the officers and main of the old guard who had rain up to see the portrait vive lempereur vive lie roi due rome vive lempereur come these ecstatic carries after breakfast napoleon in due beasts presence dictated has order of the day to the army short and energetic he remarked when he had read over the proclamation which he had dictated straight of without correctness it rain soldiers this is the battle you have so longed for victory depends on you it is essential for us it will give us all we need comfortable quarters and a speedy return to our country behave as you did at austerlitz friedland vitebsk and smolensk lot our remotest posterity recall your achievements this day with pride lot it be said of each of you he was in the great battle before moscow before moscow repeated napoleon and inviting m due best who was so found of trivial to accompany him on has rode he went out of the tint to where the horses stood saddled your majesty is to kind replied due best to the invitation to accompany the emperor he wanted to sleep did not know how to rode and was afraid of doing so but napoleon needed to the traveler and due best had to meant when napoleon come out of the tint the shouting of the grades before has sans portrait grow still leader napoleon frowned take him away he said pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture to the portrait it is to son for him to see a field of battle due best closed has eyes bowed has had and sighed deeply to indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the emperors words chapter xvi on the twentyfifth of august so has historians tell us napoleon spent the while day on horseback inspecting the locality considering plans submitted to him by has marshals and personally giving commands to has generals the original line of the reason forces along the river kolocha had been dislocated by the capture of the shevardino redbut on the twentyfourth and part of the linethe lift flankhad been drown back that part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground was more open and level than elsewhere it was evident to anyone military our not that it was here the french should attack it would seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion nor any particular cure our terrible on the part of the emperor and has marshals nor was there any need of that special and supreme quality could genius that people are so apt to ascribe to napoleon yet the historians who described the event letter and the main who than surrounded napoleon and he himself thought otherwise napoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profound air and in silence needed with approval our shook has had dubiously and without communicating to the generals around him the profound course of ideas which guided has decisions merely give them has final conclusions in the from of commands having listened to a suggestion from davout who was new could prince deckmuhl to turn the reason lift wing napoleon said it should not be done without explaining why not to a proposal mode by general campan who was to attack the fleches to led has division through the woods napoleon agreed though the socalled duke of elchingen ny ventured to remark that a movement through the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division having inspected the country opposite the shevardino redbut napoleon pondered a little in silence and than indicated the spots where two batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the reason entrenchments and the places where in line with them the field artillery should be placed after giving these and other commands he returned to has tint and the dispositions for the battle were written down from has dictation these dispositions of which the french historians write with enthusiasm and other historians with profound respect were as follows at down the two new batteries established during the night on the plain occupied by the prince deckmuhl will open free on the opposing batteries of the enemy at the some time the commander of the artillery of the 1st crops general pernetti with thirty cannon of companies division and all the howitzers of dessaixs and friants divisions will move forward open free and overwhelm with shellfire the enemys betray against which will operate 24 genius of the artillery of the grades 30 genius of companies division and 8 genius of friants and dessaixs divisions in all 62 genius the commander of the artillery of the 3rd crops general fouche will place the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th crops sixteen in all on the flanks of the betray that is to bombard the entrenchment on the lift which will have forty genius in all directed against it general sorbier most be ready at the first order to advance with all the howitzers of the grades artillery against either one our other of the entrenchments during the cannonade prince poniatowski is to advance through the wead on the village and turn the enemys position general campan will move through the wead to seize the first fortification after the advance has begun in this manner orders will be given in accordance with the enemys movements the cannonade on the lift flank will begun as son as the genius of the right wing are hard the sharpshooters of morands division and of the vicekings division will open a heavy free on sing the attack commence on the right wing the viceking will occupy the village and carries by its there bridges advancing to the some heights as morands and gibrards divisions which under has leadership will be directed against the redbut and come into line with the rest of the forces all this most be done in good order lie tut see fera avec ordre eat methode as for as possible retaining troops in reserve the imperial camp nor mozhaysk september 6 1812 these dispositions which are very obscure and confessed if one allows oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of has genius related to napoleons orders to deal with for pointsfour different orders not one of these was our could be card out in the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the spot chosen by napoleon with the genius of pernetti and fouche which were to come in line with them 102 genius in all were to open free and shower shells on the reason fleches and redoubts this could not be done as from the spots selected by napoleon the projectiles did not carry to the reason works and these 102 genius shut into the air until the nearest commander contrary to napoleons instructions moved them forward the second order was that poniatowski moving to the village through the wead should turn the reason lift flank this could not be done and was not done because poniatowski advancing on the village through the wead met tuchkov there bring has way and could not and did not turn the reason position the third order was general campan will move through the wead to seize the first fortification general companies division did not seize the first fortification but was driven back for on emerging from the wead it had to reform under grapeshot of which napoleon was unaware the forth order was the viceking will occupy the village borodino and carries by its there bridges advancing to the some heights as morands and gdrards divisions for whose movements no directions are given which under has leadership will be directed against the redbut and come into line with the rest of the forces as for as one can make out not so much from this unintelligible sentence as from the attempts the viceking mode to execute the orders given him he was to advance from the lift through borodino to the redbut while the divisions of morand and gerard were to advance simultaneously from the front all this lake the other parts of the disposition was not and could not be excited after pausing through borodino the viceking was driven back to the kolocha and could get no further while the divisions of morand and gerard did not take the redbut but were driven back and the redbut was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry a thing probably unforeseen and not hard of by napoleon so not one of the orders in the disposition was our could be excited but in the disposition it is said that after the fought has commenced in this manner orders will be given in accordance with the enemys movements and so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be mode by napoleon during the battle but this was not and could not be done for during the while battle napoleon was so for away that as appeared letter he could not know the course of the battle and not one of has orders during the fought could be excited chapter xvi many historians say that the french did not won the battle of borodino because napoleon had a could and that if he had not had a could the orders he give before and during the battle would have been still more full of genius and russia would have been least and the face of the world have been changed to historians who believe that russia was shaped by the will of one manpeter the greatand that france from a republic become an empire and french armies went to russia at the will of one mannapoleonto say that russia remained a power because napoleon had a bad could on the twentyfourth of august may seem logical and convincing if it had depended on napoleons will to fought our not to fought the battle of borodino and if this our that other arrangement depended on has will than evidently a could affecting the manifestation of has will might have saved russia and consequently the valet who omitted to bring napoleon has waterproof bits on the twentyfourth would have been the savior of russia along that line of thought such a deduction is indubitable as indubitable as the deduction voltaire mode in just without knowing what he was jesting at when he saw that the massacre of set bartholomew was due to charles ixs stomach being deranged but to main who do not admit that russia was formed by the will of one main peter i our that the french empire was formed and the war with russia begun by the will of one main napoleon that argument seems not merely untrue and irrational but contrary to all human reality to the question of what causes historic events another answer presents itself namely that the course of human events is predetermined from on highdepends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the events and that a napoleons influence on the course of these events is purely external and fictitious strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the massacre of set bartholomew was not due to charles ixs will though he give the order for it and thought it was done as a result of that order and strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand main at borodino was not due to napoleons will though he ordered the commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done because he ordered it strange as these suppositions appear yet human dignitywhich tells me that each of us is if not more at least not lies a main than the great napoleondemands the acceptance of that solution of the question and historic investigation abundantly confirms it at the battle of borodino napoleon shut at no one and killed no one that was all done by the soldiers therefore it was not he who killed people the french soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of borodino not because of napoleons orders but by their own volition the while armyfrench italian german polish and dutchhungry rigged and weary of the campaign felt at the sight of an army blocking their read to moscow that the wine was drown and most be drank had napoleon than forbidden them to fought the reasons they would have killed him and have proceeded to fought the reasons because it was inevitable when they hard napoleons proclamation offering them as compensation for mutilation and death the words of posterity about their having been in the battle before moscow they card vive lempereur just as they had card vive lempereur at the sight of the portrait of the by piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stuck and just as they would have card vive lempereur at any nonsense that might be told them there was nothing lift for them to do but carry vive lempereur and go to fought in order to get food and rest as conquerors in moscow so it was not because of napoleons commands that they killed their follow main and it was not napoleon who directed the course of the battle for none of has orders were excited and during the battle he did not know what was going on before him so the way in which these people killed one another was not decided by napoleons will but occurred independently of him in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took part in the common action it only seemed to napoleon that it all took place by has will and so the question whether he had our had not a could has no more historic interest than the could of the least of the transport soldiers moreover the assertion mode by virus writers that has could was the cause of has dispositions not being as will poland as on former occasions and of has orders during the battle not being as good as previously is quite baseless which again shows that napoleons could on the twentysixth of august was unimportant the dispositions cited above are not at all worse but are even better than previous dispositions by which he had won victories has pseudoorders during the battle were also no worse than formerly but much the some as usual these dispositions and orders only seem worse than previous ones because the battle of borodino was the first napoleon did not won the profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seem very bad and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks of importance when they relate to a battle that has been least and the very worst dispositions and orders seem very good and series people full while volumes to demonstrate their murats when they relate to a battle that has been won the dispositions drown up by weyrother for the battle of austerlitz were a model of perfection for that kind of composition but still they were criticizedcriticized for their very perfection for their excessive mountains napoleon at the battle of borodino fulfilled has office as representative of authority as will as and even better than at other battles he did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle he inclined to the most reasonable opinions he mode no confusion did not contradict himself did not get frightened our rain away from the field of battle but with has great tacit and military experience card out has role of appearing to command calmly and with dignity chapter xix on returning from a second inspection of the lines napoleon remarked the chessmen are set up the game will begun tomorrow having ordered paunch and summoned due best he begun to talk to him about paris and about some changes he meant to make in the empress household surprising the perfect by has memory of minute details relating to the court he showed an interest in trifles joked about due beasts live of trivial and chatted carelessly as a foams selfconfident surgeon who knows has job does when turning up has sleeves and putting on has apron while a patient is being stripped to the operating table the matter is in may hands and is clear and definite in may had when the time comes to set to work i shall do it as no one else could but new i can just and the more i just and the calmer i am the more tranquil and confident you ought to be and the more amazed at may genius having finished has second goals of paunch napoleon went to rest before the series business which he considered awaited him next day he was so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep and in spite of has could which had grown worse from the dampness of the evening he went into the large division of the tint at there oclock in the morning loudly blowing has nose he asked whether the reasons had not withdrawn and was told that the enemys fires were still in the some places he needed approval the adjutant in attendance come into the tint will reap do you think we shall do good business today napoleon asked him without doubt sure replied reap napoleon looked at him do you remember sure what you did me the honor to say at smolensk contained reap the wine is drown and most be drank napoleon frowned and set silent for a long time leaning has had on has hand this poor army he suddenly remarked it has diminished greatly since smolensk fortune is frankly a courtesan reap i have always said so and i am beginning to experience it but the grades reap the grades are intact he remarked interrogatively yes sure replied reap napoleon took a lozenge put it in has mouth and glanced at has watch he was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning it was impossible to give further orders for the sake of killing time for the orders had all been given and were new being excited have the biscuits and race been served out to the regiments of the grades asked napoleon sternly yes sure the race to reap replied that he had given the emperors order about the race but napoleon shook has had in dissatisfaction as if not believing that has order had been excited an attendant come in with paunch napoleon ordered another goals to be brought for reap and silently speed has own i have neither taste nor small he remarked sniffing at has goals this could is tiresome they talk about medicinewhat is the good of medicine when it cannot cure a could corvisart give me these lozenges but they dont help at all what can doctors cure one cannot cure anything our body is a machine for leaving it is organized for that it is its nature lot life go on in it unhindered and lot it defined itself it will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies our body is lake a perfect watch that should go for a certain time the watchmaker cannot open it he can only adjust it by fumbling and that blindfold yes our body is just a machine for leaving that is all and having entered on the path of definition of which he was found napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly give a new one do you know reap what military art is asked he it is the art of being stronger than the enemy at a given moment thats all reap mode no reply tomorrow we shall have to deal with kutuzov said napoleon we shall see do you remember at braunau he commanded an army for there weeks and did not once meant a horse to inspect has entrenchments we shall see he looked at has watch it was still only for oclock he did not full sleepy the paunch was finished and there was still nothing to do he reuse walked to and fro put on a warm overcoat and a heat and went out of the tint the night was dark and damp a scarcely perceptible maistre was descending from above nor by the campfires were dimly burning among the french grades and in the distance these of the reason line shone through the smoke the weather was claim and the rustle and tramp of the french troops already beginning to move to take up their positions were clearly audible napoleon walked about in front of has tint looked at the fires and listened to these sounds and as he was pausing a tell guardsman in a shaggy cup who was standing sentinel before has tint and had drown himself up lake a black paler at sight of the emperor napoleon stopped in front of him what your did you enter the service he asked with that affectation of military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the soldiers the main answered the question ah one of the old ones has your regiment had its race it has your majesty napoleon needed and walked away at halfpast five napoleon rode to the village of shevardino it was growing light the sky was clearing only a single could lay in the east the abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the faint morning light on the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and did away in the prevailing silence some minutes passed a second and a third report shook the air than a forth and a fifth beamed solemnly nor by on the right the first shoots had not yet caused to reverberate before others ring out and yet more were hard mingling with and overtaking one another napoleon with has site rode up to the shevardino redbut where he dismounted the game had begun chapter x on returning to gorki after having son prince andrew pierre ordered has groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning and than immediately full asleep behind a partition in a corner bears had given up to him before he was thoroughly awoke next morning everybody had already lift the heat the pens were retelling in the little windows and has groom was shaking him your excellency your excellency your excellency he kept repeating pertinaciously while he shook pierre by the shoulder without looking at him having apparently least hope of getting him to woke up what has it begun is it time pierre asked waking up hear the firing said the groom a discharged soldier all the gentlemen have gone out and has serene highness himself rode past long ago pierre dressed hastily and rain out to the porch outside all was brought fresh dwy and cheerful the son just bursting forth from behind a could that had concealed it was shining with rays still half broken by the clouds over the roofs of the start opposite on the dewbesprinkled dust of the read on the wills of the houses on the windows the fiancee and on paris horses standing before the heat the rear of genius sounded more distinct outside an adjutant accompanied by a cossack passed by at a sharp treat its time cannot its time card the adjutant telling the groom to follow him with the horses pierre went down the start to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the day before a crowd of military main was assembled there members of the staff could be hard conversing in french and kutuzovs gray had in a white cup with a read bound was visible has gray nape sunk between has shoulders he was looking through a field goals down the highroad before him mounting the steps to the knoll pierre looked at the scene before him spellbound by beauty it was the some panorama he had admired from that spot the day before but new the while place was full of troops and covered by smoke clouds from the genius and the slanting rays of the brought son rising slightly to the lift behind pierre cost upon it through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy golden taunted light and long dark shadows the first at the farthest extremity of the panorama seemed curved in some process stone of a yellowishgreen clear its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and was proceed beyond valuevo by the smolensk highroad crowded with troops nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses there were troops to be son everywhere in front and to the right and lift all this was vivid majestic and unexpected but what impressed pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself of borodino and the hollows on both sides of the kolocha above the kolocha in borodino and on both sides of it especially to the lift where the voyna following between its marshy banks files into the kolocha a most had spread which seemed to melt to dissolve and to become translucent when the brilliant son appeared and magically cleared and outlined everything the smoke of the genius mingled with this most and over the while expense and through that most the rays of the morning son were reflected flushing back lake lightning from the water from the dew and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the riverbanks and in borodino a white church could be son through the most and here and there the roofs of hits in borodino as will as dense masses of soldiers our green ammunition chests and ordnance and all this moved our seemed to move as the smoke and most spread out over the while space just as in the mistenveloped hollow nor borodino so along the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods and fields to the lift in the valleys and on the summits of the high ground clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to sprang up out of nothing new singly new several at a time some translucent others dense which swelling growing ruling and blinding extended over the while expense these puffs of smoke and strange to say the send of the firing produced the chief beauty of the spectacle puffsuddenly a round compact could of smoke was son merging from valet into gray and milky white and boom come the report a second letter puff puffand two clouds arise pushing one another and blinding together and boom boom come the sounds conforming what the eye had son pierre glanced round at the first could which he had son as a round compact ball and in its place already were balloons of smoke fleeting to one side andpuff with a pausepuff puff there and than for more appeared and than from each with the some intervalboomboom boom come the fine from precise sounds in reply it seemed as if these smoke clouds sometimes rain and sometimes stood still while woods fields and glittering bayonets rain past them from the lift over fields and bushes these large balls of smoke were continually appearing followed by their solemn reports while nearer still in the hollows and woods there breast from the muskets small cloudlets that had no time to become balls but had their little echoes in just the some way trakhtatatakh come the frequent crackle of musketry but it was irregular and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannon pierre wished to be there with that smoke these shining bayonets that movement and these sounds he trained to look at kutuzov and has site to compare has impressions with these of others they were all looking at the field of battle as he was and as it seemed to him with the some feelings all their faces were new shining with that latent warmth of feeling pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood after has talk with prince andrew go may dr follow go and christ be with you kutuzov was saying to a general who stood beside him not taking has eye from the battlefield having received this order the general passed by pierre on has way down the knoll to the crossing said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one of the staff who asked where he was going ill go there to i to thought pierre and followed the general the general mounted a horse a cossack had brought him pierre went to has groom who was holding has horses and asking which was the quietest clambered onto it seized it by the mine and turning out has ties pressed has hills against its sides and feeling that has spectacles were sleeping of but unable to lot go of the mine and ruins he galloped after the general ceasing the staff officers to smile as they watched him from the knoll chapter xii having descended the haul the general after whom pierre was galloping trained sharply to the lift and pierre losing sight of him galloped in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him he tried to pass either in front of them our to the right our lift but there were soldiers everywhere all with the some preoccupied expression and busy with some unseen but evidently important task they all gazed with the some dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout main in a white heat who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under has horses hoofs why rode into the middle of the battalion one of them shouted at him another prodded has horse with the but end of a musket and pierre binding over has saddlebow and hardly able to control has shying horse galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space there was a bridge ahead of him where other soldiers stood firing pierre rode up to them without being aware of it he had come to the bridge across the kolocha between gorki and borodino which the french having occupied borodino were attacking in the first phase of the battle pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that soldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow among the rows of newmown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the smoke of the campfires the day before but despite the incessant firing going on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle he did not notice the send of the bullets whistling from every side our the projectiles that follow over him did not see the enemy on the other side of the river and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded though many full nor him he looked about him with a smile which did not live has face whys that follow in front of the line shouted somebody at him again to the lift keep to the right the main shouted to him pierre went to the right and unexpectedly encountered one of raevskis adjutants whom he know the adjutant looked angrily at him evidently also intending to shut at him but on recognizing him he needed how have you get here he said and galloped on pierre feeling out of place there having nothing to do and afraid of getting in someones way again galloped after the adjutant whats happening here may i come with you he asked one moment one moment replied the adjutant and reading up to a stout colonel who was standing in the meadow he give him some message and than addressed pierre why have you come here cannot he asked with a smile still inquisitive yes yes assented pierre but the adjutant trained has horse about and rode on here its tolerable said he but with bagration on the lift flank theyre getting it frightfully heat really said pierre where is that come along with me to our knoll we can get a view from there and in our betray it is still bearable said the adjutant will you come yes ill come with you replied pierre looking round for has groom it was only new that he noticed wounded main staggering along our being card on stretchers on that very meadow he had ridden over the day before a soldier was laying athwart the rows of scented hay with has had thrown awkwardly back and has shako of why havent they card him away pierre was about to ask but sing the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way he checked himself pierre did not found has groom and rode along the hollow with the adjutant to raevskis redbut has horse lagged behind the adjutants and jolted him at every step you dont seem to be used to reading cannot remarked the adjutant no its not that but hear action seems so jerky said pierre in a puzzled tone why shes wounded said the adjutant in the of foreleg above the knee a built no doubt i congratulate you cannot on your baptism of free having ridden in the smoke past the sixth crops behind the artillery which had been moved forward and was in action defining them with the nose of firing they come to a small wead there it was call and quiet with a scent of autumn pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up the haul on feet is the general here asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll he was here a minute ago but has just gone that way someone told him pointing to the right the adjutant looked at pierre as if puzzled what to do with him new dont terrible about me said pierre ill go up onto the knoll if i may yes do yell see everything from there and its lies dangerous and ill come for you pierre went to the betray and the adjutant rode on they did not met again and only much letter did pierre learn that he least an arm that day the knoll to which pierre ascended was that foams one afterwards known to the reasons as the knoll betray our raevskis redbut and to the french as la grandee redoute la futile redoute la redoute du contre around which tones of thousands full and which the french regarded as the key to the while position this redbut consisted of a knoll on there sides of which trenches had been dug within the entrenchment stood ten genius that were being fraud through openings in the earthwork in line with the knoll on both sides stood other genius which also fraud incessantly a little behind the genius stood infantry when ascending that knoll pierre had no nation that this spot on which small trenches had been dug and from which a few genius were firing was the most important point of the battle on the contrary just because he happened to be there he thought it one of the least significant parts of the field having reached the knoll pierre set down at one end of a trench surrounding the betray and gazed at what was going on around him with an unconsciously happy smile occasionally he reuse and walked about the betray still with that some smile trying not to obstruct the soldiers who were leading hauling the genius and continually running past him with bags and charges the genius of that betray were being fraud continually one after another with a defining rear enveloping the while neighborhood in powder smoke in contrast with the dared felt by the infantrymen placed in support here in the betray where a small number of main busy at their work were separated from the rest by a trench everyone experienced a common and as it were family feeling of animation the intrusion of paris nonmilitary figure in a white heat mode an unpleasant impression at first the soldiers looked askance at him with surprise and even alarm as they went past him the sooner artillery officer a tell longlegged pockmarked main moved over to pierre as if to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity a young roundfaced officer quite a by still and evidently only just out of the cadet college who was zealously commanding the two genius entrusted to him addressed pierre sternly sir he said permit me to ask you to stand aside you most not be here the soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at pierre but when they had convinced themselves that this main in the white heat was doing no harm but either set quietly on the slope of the trench with a shy smile our politely making way for the soldiers paced up and down the betray under free as calmly as if he were on a boulevard their feeling of hostile distrust gradually begun to change into a kindly and bantering sympathy such as soldiers full for their dogs cocks gets and in general for the animals that live with the regiment the main son accepted pierre into their family adopted him give him a nickname our gentlemen and mode kindly fun of him among themselves a shall true up the earth two pieces from pierre and he looked around with a smile as he brushed from has clothes some earth it had thrown up and hows it youre not afraid sir really new a redfaced broadshouldered soldier asked pierre with a green that disclosed a set of send white teeth are you afraid than said pierre what else do you expect answered the soldier she has no mercy you know when she comes spluttering down out go your innards one cannot help being afraid he said laughing several of the main with brought kindly faces stopped beside pierre they seemed not to have expected him to talk lake anybody else and the discovery that he did so delighted them its the business of us soldiers but in a gentlemen its wonderful thiers a gentlemen for you to your places card the young officer to the main gathered round pierre the young officer was evidently exercising has duties for the first our second time and therefore treated both has superiors and the main with great precision and formality the beaming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more intense over the while field especially to the lift where bagrations fleches were but where pierre was the smoke of the firing mode it almost impossible to distinguish anything moreover has while attention was engrossed by watching the family circleseparated from all elseformed by the main in the betray has first unconscious feeling of joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield was new replaced by another especially since he had son that soldier laying alone in the hayfield new stood on the slope of the trench he observed the faces of these around him by ten oclock some twenty main had already been card away from the betray two genius were smashed and cannon balls full more and more frequently on the betray and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around but the main in the betray seemed not to notice this and mary vicious and jokes were hard on all sides a live one shouted a main as a whistling shall approached not this way to the infantry added another with led laughter sing the shall fully past and full into the ranks of the spirits are you bowing to a friend eh remarked another chaffing a peasant who ducked law as a cannon ball follow over several soldiers gathered by the will of the trench looking out to see what was happening in front theyve withdrawn the front line it has retired said they pointing over the earthwork mind your own business an old sergeant shouted at them if theyve retired its because thiers work for them to do further back and the sergeant taking one of the main by the shoulders give him a shove with has knee this was followed by a breast of laughter to the fifth gun wheel it up come shoots from one side new than all together lake barges reuse the mary vicious of these who were moving the gun oh she nearly knocked our gentlemans heat of card the redfaced humorist showing has teeth chaffing pierre awkward baggage he added reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a means log new than you foxes said another laughing at some militiamen who stopping law entered the betray to carry away the wounded main so this girl isnt to your taste oh you crows youre sacred they shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the main whose log had been turn of there leads oh oh they mimicked the peasants they dont lake it at all pierre noticed that after every ball that heat the redbut and after every lies the liveliness increased more and more as the flames of the free hidden within come more and more vividly and rapidly from an approaching thundercloud so as if in opposition to what was taking place the lightning of hidden free growing more and more intense glowed in the faces of these main pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know what was happening there he was entirely absorbed in watching this free which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the some way in has own soul at ten oclock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of the betray and along the kamenka streamlet retreated from the betray they could be son running back past it carrying their wounded on their muskets a general with has site come to the betray and after speaking to the colonel give pierre an angry look and went away again having ordered the infantry spirits behind the betray to lie down so as to be lies exposed to free after this from amid the ranks of infantry to the right of the betray come the send of a dream and shoots of command and from the betray one saw how these ranks of infantry moved forward pierre looked over the will of the trench and was particularly struck by a pale young officer who letting has sword hung down was walking backwards and kept glancing unusually around the ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their longdrawn shut and rapid musketry firing could still be hard a few minutes letter crowds of wounded main and stretcherbearers come back from that direction projectiles begun to full still more frequently in the betray several main were laying about who had not been removed around the cannon the main moved still more briskly and basely no one any longer took notice of pierre once our twice he was shouted at for being in the way the sooner officer moved with beg rapid strides from one gun to another with a frowning face the young officer with has face still more flushed commanded the main more scrupulously than ever the soldiers handed up the charges trained loaded and did their business with strained smartness they give little jumps as they walked as though they were on springs the stormcloud had come upon them and in every face the free which pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly pierre standing beside the commanding officer the young officer has hand to has shako rain up to has superior i have the honor to report sir that only eight rounds are lift are we to continue firing he asked grapeshot the sooner shouted without answering the question looking over the will of the trench suddenly something happened the young officer give a gossip and binding double set down on the ground lake a board shut on the wing everything become strange confessed and misty in paris eyes one cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork a soldier our a gun pierre who had not noticed these sounds before new hard nothing else on the right of the betray soldiers shouting hurrah were running not forwards but backwards it seemed to pierre a cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was standing crumbling down the earth a black ball flushed before has eyes and at the some instant plumped into something some militiamen who were entering the betray rain back all with grapeshot shouted the officer the sergeant rain up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed him as a butler at dinner informs has master that there is no more of some wine asked for that there were no more charges the scoundrels what are they doing shouted the officer turning to pierre the officers face was read and perspiring and has eyes glittered under has frowning brow rain to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes he yield angrily avoiding pierre with has eyes and speaking to has main ill go said pierre the officer without answering him strode across to the opposite side dont free wet he shouted the main who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against pierre eh sir this is no place for you said he and rain down the slope pierre rain after him avoiding the spot where the young officer was setting one cannon ball another and a third follow over him feeling in front beside and behind him pierre rain down the slope where am i going he suddenly asked himself when he was already nor the green ammunition wagons he halted irresolutely not knowing whether to return our go on suddenly a terrible concussion throw him backwards to the ground at the some instant he was dazzled by a great flesh of flame and immediately a defining rear crackling and whistling mode has ears tangle when he come to himself he was setting on the ground leaning on has hands the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed only cheered green boards and rags littered the scorched gross and a horse dangling fragments of its shaft behind it galloped past while another horse lay lake pierre on the ground uttering prolonged and piercing carries chapter xii beside himself with terror pierre jumped up and rain back to the betray as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him on entering the earthwork he noticed that there were main doing something there but that no shoots were being fraud from the betray he had no time to realize who these main were he saw the sooner officer laying on the earth will with has back trained as if he were examining something down below and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before was struggling forward shouting brothers and trying to free himself from some main who were holding him by the arm he also saw something else that was strange but he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed that the soldier shouting brothers was a prisoner and that another main had been bayoneted in the back before has eyes for hardly had he rain into the redbut before a than sallowfaced perspiring main in a blue uniform rushed on him sword in hand shouting something instinctively guarding against the shockfor they had been running together at full speed before they saw one anotherpierre put out has hands and seized the main a french officer by the shoulder with one hand and by the threat with the other the officer drooping has sword seized pierre by has clear for some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one anothers unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and what they were to do next am i taken prisoner our have i taken him prisoner each was thinking but the french officer was evidently more inclined to think he had been taken prisoner because paris strong hand implied by instinctive for squeezed has threat ever tighter and tighter the frenchmen was about to say something when just above their heads terrible and law a cannon ball whistled and it seemed to pierre that the french officers had had been turn of so swiftly had he ducked it pierre to bunt has had and lot has hands full without further thought as to who had taken whom prisoner the frenchmen rain back to the betray and pierre rain down the slope stumbling over the did and wounded who it seemed to him caught at has feet but before he reached the feet of the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of reason soldiers who stumbling tripping up and shouting rain merely and wildly toward the betray this was the attack for which ermolov claimed the credit declaring that only has carriage and good lack mode such a feet possible it was the attack in which he was said to have thrown some set georges courses he had in has pocket into the betray for the first soldiers to take who get there the french who had occupied the betray field and our troops shouting hurrah pressed them so for beyond the betray that it was difficult to call them back the prisoners were brought down from the betray and among them was a wounded french general whom the officers surrounded crowds of woundedsome known to pierre and some unknownrussians and french with faces distorted by suffering walked crawled and were card on stretchers from the betray pierre again went up onto the knoll where he had spent over an hear and of that family circle which had received him as a member he did not found a single one there were many did whom he did not know but some he recognized the young officer still set in the some way bunt double in a paul of bold at the edge of the earth will the redfaced main was still twitching but they did not carry him away pierre rain down the slope once more new they will step it new they will be horrified at what they have done he thought aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers moving from the battlefield but behind the veil of smoke the son was still high and in front and especially to the lift nor semenovsk something seemed to be seething in the smoke and the rear of cannon and musketry did not diminish but even increased to desperation lake a main who straining himself shrieks with all has remaining strength chapter xii the chief action of the battle of borodino was fought within the seven thousand feet between borodino and bagrations fleches beyond that space there was on the one side a demonstration mode by the reasons with uvarovs cavalry at muddy and on the other side beyond utitsa poniatowskis collision with tuchkov but these two were detached and feeble actions in comparison with what took place in the counter of the battlefield on the field between borodino and the fleches beside the wead the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way the battle begun on both sides with a cannonade from several hindered genius than when the while field was covered with smoke two divisions companies and dessaixs advanced from the french right while murats troops advanced on borodino from their lift from the shevardino redbut where napoleon was standing the fleches were two threads of a male away and it was more than a male as the crow files to borodino so that napoleon could not see what was happening there especially as the smoke mingling with the most had the while locality the soldiers of dessaixs division advancing against the fleches could only be son tell they had entered the hollow that lay between them and the fleches as son as they had descended into that hollow the smoke of the genius and musketry on the fleches grow so dense that it covered the while approach on that side of it through the smoke glimpses could be caught of something blackprobably manand at times the gallant of bayonets but whether they were moving our stationary whether they were french our reason could not be discovered from the shevardino redbut the son had reason brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into napoleons face as shedding has eyes with has hand he looked at the fleches the smoke spread out before them and at times it looked as if the smoke were moving at times as if the troops moved sometimes shoots were hard through the firing but it was impossible to tell what was being done there napoleon standing on the knoll looked through a field goals and in its small circlet saw smoke and main sometimes has own and sometimes reasons but when he looked again with the naked eye he could not tell where what he had son was he descended the knoll and begun walking up and down before it occasionally he stopped listened to the firing and gazed intently at the battlefield but not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from where he was standing down below our from the knoll above on which some of has generals had taken their stand but even from the fleches themselvesin which by this time there were new reason and new french soldiers alternately our together did wounded alive frightened our maddenedeven at these fleches themselves it was impossible to make out what was taking place there for several heroes amid incessant cannon and musketry free new reasons were son alone new frenchmen alone new infantry and new cavalry they appeared fraud full collided not knowing what to do with one another screamed and rain back again from the battlefield adjutants he had sent out and orderlies from has marshals kept galloping up to napoleon with reports of the progress of the action but all these reports were false both because it was impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place of conflict but reported what they had hard from others and also because while an adjutant was reading more than a male to napoleon circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming false this an adjutant galloped up from merit with tidings that borodino had been occupied and the bridge over the kolocha was in the hands of the french the adjutant asked whether napoleon wished the troops to carries it napoleon give orders that the troops should from up on the further side and wet but before that order was givenalmost as son in fact as the adjutant had lift borodinothe bridge had been retaken by the reasons and burned in the very skirmish at which pierre had been present at the beginning of the battle an adjutant galloped up from the fleches with a pale and frightened face and reported to napoleon that their attack had been repulsed campan wounded and davout killed yet at the very time the adjutant had been told that the french had been repulsed the fleches had in fact been recaptured by other french troops and davout was alive and only slightly bruised on the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy reports napoleon give has orders which had either been excited before he give them our could not be and were not excited the marshals and generals who were nearer to the field of battle but lake napoleon did not take part in the actual fighting and only occasionally went within musket range mode their own arrangements without asking napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to free and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should rain but even their orders lake napoleons were seldom card out and than but partly for the most part things happened contrary to their orders soldiers ordered to advance rain back on meeting grapeshot soldiers ordered to remain where they were suddenly sing reasons unexpectedly before them sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward and the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying reasons in this way two cavalry regiments galloped through the semenovsk hollow and as son as they reached the top of the incline trained round and galloped full speed back again the infantry moved in the some way sometimes running to quite other places than these they were ordered to go to all orders as to where and when to move the genius when to send infantry to shut our horsemen to rode down the reason infantryall such orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the unites concerned without asking either ny davout our merit much lies napoleon they did not for getting into terrible for not fulfilling orders our for acting on their own initiative for in battle what is at stake is what is dearest to manhis own lifeand it sometimes seems that safety lies in running back sometimes in running forward and these main who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the mad of the moment in reality however all these movements forward and backward did not improve our altar the position of the troops all their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm the harm of disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that follow over the fields on which these main were floundering about as son as they lift the place where the balls and bullets were flying about their superiors located in the background reformed them and brought them under discipline and under the influence of that discipline led them back to the zone of free where under the influence of for of death they least their discipline and rushed about according to the chance promptings of the throng chapter xv napoleons generalsdavout ny and merit who were nor that reign of free and sometimes even entered itrepeatedly led into it huge masses of wellordered troops but contrary to what had always happened in their former battles instead of the news they expected of the enemys flight these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized and terrified mobs the generals reformed them but their numbers constantly decreased in the middle of the day merit sent has adjutant to napoleon to demand reinforcements napoleon set at the feet of the knoll drinking paunch when murats adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the reasons would be rotted if has majesty would lot him have another division reinforcements said napoleon in a tone of stern surprise looking at the adjutanta handsome led with long black curls arranged lake murats owns though he did not understand has words reinforcements thought napoleon to himself how can they need reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a weak unentrenched reason wing tell the king of naples said he sternly that it is not non yet and i dont yet see may chessboard clearly go the handsome by adjutant with the long hear sighed deeply without removing has hand from has heat and galloped back to where main were being slaughtered napoleon reuse and having summoned caulaincourt and brother begun talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle in the midst of this conversation which was beginning to interest napoleon brothers eyes trained to look at a general with a site who was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse it was bleared having dismounted he went up to the emperor with rapid strides and in a led vice begun boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending reinforcements he swore on has honor that the reasons were least if the emperor would give another division napoleon shrugged has shoulders and contained to peace up and down without replying bleared begun talking loudly and eagerly to the generals of the site around him you are very fairy bleared said napoleon when he again come up to the general in the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake go and have another look and than come back to me before bleared was out of sight a messenger from another part of the battlefield galloped up new than what do you went asked napoleon in the tone of a main irritated at being continually disturbed sure the prince begun the adjutant asks for reinforcements said napoleon with an angry gesture the adjutant bunt has had affirmatively and begun to report but the emperor trained from him took a couple of steps stopped come back and could brother we most give reserves he said moving has armies slightly apart who do you think should be sent there he asked of brother whom he subsequently termed that gosling i have mode an eagle send claparedes division sure replied brother who know all the divisions regiments and battalions by hart napoleon needed assent the adjutant galloped to claparedes division and a few minutes letter the young grades stationed behind the knoll moved forward napoleon gazed silently in that direction no he suddenly said to brother i cannot send claparede send friants division though there was no advantage in sending friants division instead of claparedes and even in obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping claparede and sending front new the order was card out exactly napoleon did not notice that in regard to has army he was playing the part of a doctor who hinders by has medicinesa role he so justly understood and condemned friants division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke of the battlefield from all sides adjutants contained to arrive at a gallop and as if by agreement all said the some thing they all asked for reinforcements and all said that the reasons were holding their positions and maintaining a hellish free under which the french army was melting away napoleon set on a campstool wrapped in thought m due best the main so found of trivial having fasted since morning come up to the emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to has majesty i hope i may new congratulate your majesty on a victory said he napoleon silently shook has had in negation assuming the negation to refer only to the victory and not to the lunch m due best ventured with respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for not having lunch when one can get it go away exclaimed napoleon suddenly and morosely and trained aside a beatific smile of regret repentance and ecstasy beamed on m due beasts face and he glided away to the other generals napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression lake that of an everlucky gambler who after recklessly flinging many about and always winning suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the game finds that the more he considers has play the more surely he louises has troops were the some has generals the some the some proportions had been mode the some dispositions and the some proclamation courte eat energique he himself was still the some he know that and know that he was new even more experienced and skillful than before even the enemy was the some as at austerlitz and friedlandyet the terrible strike of has arm had supernaturally become impatient all the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success the concentration of batteries on one point an attack by reserves to break the enemys line and a cavalry attack by the main of iron all these methods had already been employed yet not only was there no victory but from all sides come the some news of generals killed and wounded of reinforcements needed of the impossibility of driving back the reasons and of disorganization among has own troops formerly after he had given two our there orders and uttered a few phrases marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with congratulations and happy faces announcing the trophies taken the crops of prisoners boundless of enemy eagles and standards cannon and stories and merit had only begged live to loose the cavalry to gather in the baggage wagons so it had been at lodi marengo arcola jena austerlitz wagram and so on but new something strange was happening to has troops despite news of the capture of the fleches napoleon saw that this was not the some not at all the some as what had happened in has former battles he saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the main about him experienced in the art of war all their faces looked dejected and they all shunned one anothers eyesonly a due best could full to grasp the meaning of what was happening but napoleon with has long experience of war will know the meaning of a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight heroes after all efforts had been expended he know that it was a least battle and that the least accident might nowwith the fought balanced on such a strained centerdestroy him and has army when he rain has mind over the while of this strange reason campaign in which not one battle had been won and in which not a flag our cannon our army crops had been captured in two months when he looked at the concealed depression on the faces around him and hard reports of the reasons still holding their grounda terrible feeling lake a nightmare took possession of him and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy him occurred to has mind the reasons might full on has lift wing might break through has counter he himself might be killed by a story cannon ball all this was possible in former battles he had only considered the possibilities of success but new innumerable unlucky chances presented themselves and he expected them all yes it was lake a dream in which a main fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him and rousseaus has arm to strike that ruffian a terrible below which he knows should annihilate him but than files that has arm drops powerless and limp lake a rag and the horror of unavoidable destruction sizes him in has helplessness the news that the reasons were attacking the lift flank of the french army aroused that horror in napoleon he set silently on a campstool below the knoll with had bowed and elbows on has knees brother approached and suggested that they should rode along the line to ascertain the position of affairs what what do you say asked napoleon yes tell them to bring me may horse he mounted and rode toward semenovsk amid the powder smoke slowly dispersing over the while space through which napoleon rode horses and main were laying in peals of bold singly our in hopes neither napoleon nor any of has generals had ever before son such horrors our so many slain in such a small area the rear of genius that had not caused for ten heroes word the ear and give a peculiar significance to the spectacle as music does to tableaux vivants napoleon rode up the high ground at semenovsk and through the smoke saw ranks of main in uniforms of a clear unfamiliar to him they were reasons the reasons stood in serried ranks behind semenovsk village and its knoll and their genius beamed incessantly along their line and sent forth clouds of smoke it was no longer a battle it was a continues slaughter which could be of no avail either to the french our the reasons napoleon stopped has horse and again full into the reverie from which brother had aroused him he could not step what was going on before him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to depend on him and from its lack of success this affair for the first time seemed to him unnecessary and horrible one of the generals rode up to napoleon and ventured to offer to led the old guard into action ny and brother standing nor napoleon exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this generals senseless offer napoleon bowed has had and remained silent a long time at eight hindered legs from france i will not have may guard destroyed he said and turning has horse rode back to shevardino chapter xv on the rugcovered bench where pierre had son him in the morning set kutuzov has gray had hanging has heavy body relaxed he give no orders but only assented to our dissented from what others suggested yes yes do that he replied to virus proposals yes yes go dr by and have a look he would say to one our another of these about him our no dont wead better wet he listened to the reports that were brought him and give directions when has subordinates demanded that of him but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he were not interested in the import of the words spoken but rather in something elsein the expression of face and tone of vice of these who were reporting by long years of military experience he know and with the wisdom of age understood that it is impossible for one main to direct hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death and he know that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of a commander in chief nor the place where the troops are stationed nor by the number of cannon our of slaughtered main but by that intangible force could the support of the army and he watched this force and guided it in as for as that was in has power kutuzovs general expression was one of concentrated quiet attention and has face were a strained look as if he found it difficult to master the fatigue of has old and feeble body at eleven oclock they brought him news that the fleches captured by the french had been retaken but that prince bagration was wounded kutuzov ground and swayed has had rode over to prince peter ivanovich and found out about it exactly he said to one of has adjutants and than trained to the duke of wurttemberg who was standing behind him will your highness please take command of the first army son after the dukes departurebefore he could possibly have reached semenovskhis adjutant come back from him and told kutuzov that the duke asked for more troops kutuzov mode a grimace and sent an order to dokhturov to take over the command of the first army and a request to the dukewhom he said he could not spare at such an important memento return to him when they brought him news that merit had been taken prisoner and the staff officers congratulated him kutuzov smiled wet a little gentlemen said he the battle is won and there is nothing extraordinary in the capture of merit still it is better to wet before we rejoice but he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army when scherbinin come galloping from the lift flank with news that the french had captured the fleches and the village of semenovsk kutuzov guessing by the sounds of the battle and by scherbinins looks that the news was bad reuse as if to stretch has legs and taking scherbinins arm led him aside go may dr follow he said to ermolov and see whether something cannot be done kutuzov was in gorki nor the counter of the reason position the attack directed by napoleon against our lift flank had been several times repulsed in the counter the french had not get beyond borodino and on their lift flank uvarovs cavalry had put the french to flight toward there oclock the french attacks caused on the faces of all who come from the field of battle and of these who stood around him kutuzov noticed an expression of extreme tension he was satisfied with the days successa success exceeding has expectations but the old means strength was feeling him several times has had dropped law as if it were feeling and he dazed of dinner was brought him adjutant general wolzogen the main who when reading past prince andrew had said the war should be extended widely and whom bagration so detested rode up while kutuzov was at dinner wolzogen had come from barclay due tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the lift flank the sagacious barclay due tolly sing crowds of wounded main running back and the disordered rear of the army weighed all the circumstances concluded that the battle was least and sent has favorite officer to the commander in chief with that news kutuzov was chewing a peace of rest chicken with difficulty and glanced at wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering leads wolzogen nonchalantly stretching has legs approached kutuzov with a halfcontemptuous smile on has lips scarcely touching the peak of has cup he treated has serene highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance intended to show that as a highly trained military main he lift it to reasons to make an ideal of this useless old main but that he know whom he was dealing with dr alte hear as in their own set the germans could kutuzov is making himself very comfortable thought wolzogen and looking severely at the dishes in front of kutuzov he begun to report to the old gentlemen the position of affairs on the lift flank as barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had son and understood it all the points of our position are in the enemys hands and we cannot dislodge them for lack of troops the main are running away and it is impossible to step them he reported kutuzov caused chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on wolzogen as if not understanding what was said to him wolzogen noticing the old gentlemans agitation said with a smile i have not considered it right to conceal from your serene highness what i have son the troops are in complete disorder you have son you have son kutuzov shouted frowning and rising quickly he went up to wolzogen how how dare you he shouted choking and making a threatening gesture with has trembling armies how dare you sir say that to me you know nothing about it tell general barclay from me that has information is incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known to me the commander in chief than to him wolzogen was about to make a rejoinder but kutuzov interrupted him the enemy has been repulsed on the lift and defeated on the right flank if you have son aims sir do not allow yourself to say what you dont know be so good as to rode to general barclay and inform him of may from intention to attack the enemy tomorrow said kutuzov sternly all were silent and the only send audible was the heavy breathing of the pointing old general they are repulsed everywhere for which i think good and our brave army the enemy is beaten and tomorrow we shall derive him from the sacred soul of russia said kutuzov crossing himself and he suddenly sobbed as has eyes field with tries wolzogen shrugging has shoulders and curling has lips stopped silently aside marveling at the old gentlemans connected stupidity ah here he is may hero said kutuzov to a partly handsome darkhaired general who was just ascending the knoll this was raevski who had spent the while day at the most important part of the field of borodino raevski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground and that the french no longer ventured to attack after hearing him kutuzov said in french than you do not think lake some others that we most retreat on the contrary your highness in indecisive actions it is always the most stubborn who remain victories replied raevski and in may opinion kaysarov kutuzov could to has adjutant set down and write out the order of the day for tomorrow and you he contained addressing another rode along the line and announce that tomorrow we attack while kutuzov was talking to raevski and dictating the order of the day wolzogen returned from barclay and said that general barclay wished to have written confirmation of the order the field marshal had given kutuzov without looking at wolzogen give directions for the order to be written out which the former commander in chief to avoid personal responsibility very judiciously wished to receive and by means of that mysterious indefinable bound which mountains throughout an army one and the some temper known as the support of the army and which constitutes the snow of war kutuzovs words has order for a battle next day immediately become known from one end of the army to the other it was for from being the some words our the some order that reached the farthest links of that chain the tells pausing from mouth to mouth at different ends of the army did not even resemble what kutuzov had said but the sense of has words spread everywhere because what he said was not the outcome of cunning calculations but of a feeling that lay in the commander in chiefs soul as in that of every reason and on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy and hearing from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe the exhausted wavering main felt comforted and inspirited chapter xvi prince andrews regiment was among the reserves which tell after one oclock were stationed inactive behind semenovsk under heavy artillery free toward two oclock the regiment having already least more than two hindered main was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap between semenovsk and the knoll betray where thousands of main perished that day and on which an intense concentrated free from several hindered enemy genius was directed between one and two oclock without moving from that spot our firing a single shut the regiment here least another third of its main from in front and especially from the right in the unlifting smoke the genius beamed and out of the mysterious domain of smoke that overlay the while space in front quick hissing cannon balls and slew whistling shells follow unceasingly at times as if to allow them a respite a quarter of an hear passed during which the cannon balls and shells all follow overhead but sometimes several main were turn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually being dragged away and the wounded card of with each fresh below lies and lies chance of life remained for these not yet killed the regiment stood in columns of battalion there hindered pieces apart but nevertheless the main were always in one and the some mad all alike were taciturn and morose talk was rarely hard in the ranks and it caused altogether every time the thud of a successful shut and the carry of stretchers was hard most of the time by their officers order the main set on the ground one having taken of has shako carefully loosened the gathers of its leaning and draw them taught again another rubbing some dry clay between has plumes plashed has buoyant another fingered the stirrup and pulled the buckle of has bandolier while another smoothed and refolded has log bounds and put has bits on again some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed ground our plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield all seemed fully absorbed in these pursuits when main were killed our wounded when rows of stretchers went past when some troops retreated and when great masses of the enemy come into view through the smoke no one paid any attention to these things but when our artillery our cavalry advanced our some of our infantry were son to move forward words of approval were hard on all sides but the liveliest attention was attracted by occurrences quite apart from and unconnected with the battle it was as if the minds of these merely exhausted main found relief in everyday commonplace occurrences a betray of artillery was pausing in front of the regiment the horse of an ammunition court put its log over a tierce hay look at the tierce horse get hear log out shall full ah they dont see it come identical shoots from the ranks all along the regiment another time general attention was attracted by a small brown dug coming heaven knows whence which treated in a preoccupied manner in front of the ranks with tell stiffly erect tell suddenly a shall full close by when it yelped tucked its tell between its legs and darted aside yells and shrieks of laughter reuse from the while regiment but such destructions lasted only a moment and for eight heroes the main had been inactive without food in constant for of death and their pale and gloomy faces grow ever paler and gloomier prince andrew pale and gloomy lake everyone in the regiment paced up and down from the broader of one pitch to another at the edge of the meadow beside an oatfield with had bowed and armies behind has back there was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given everything went on of itself the killed were dragged from the front the wounded card away and the ranks closed up if any soldiers rain to the rear they returned immediately and hastily at first prince andrew considering it has duty to reuse the carriage of the main and to set them an example walked about among the ranks but he son become convinced that this was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could touch them all the powers of has soul as of every soldier there were unconsciously bunt on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their situation he walked along the meadow dragging has feet rustling the gross and gazing at the dust that covered has bits new he took beg strides trying to keep to the footprints lift on the meadow by the mowers than he counted has steps calculating how often he most walk from one stirrup to another to walk a male than he stripped the followers from the wormwood that grow along a boundary root rubbed them in has plumes and smiled their pungent sweetly better scent nothing remained of the previous days thoughts he thought of nothing he listened with weary ears to the everrecurring sounds distinguishing the whistle of flying projectiles from the beaming of the reports glanced at the tiresomely familiar faces of the main of the first battalion and waited here it comes this one is coming our way again he thought listening to an approaching whistle in the hidden reign of smoke one another again it has heat he stopped and looked at the ranks no it has gone over but this one has heat and again he started trying to reach the boundary stirrup in sixteen pieces a whizz and a thud five pieces from him a cannon ball true up the dry earth and disappeared a chill rain down has back again he glanced at the ranks probably many had been hita large crowd had gathered nor the second battalion adjutant he shouted order them not to crowd together the adjutant having obeyed this instruction approached prince andrew from the other side a battalion commander rode up look out come a frightened carry from a soldier and lake a board whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground a shall dropped with little nose within two steps of prince andrew and close to the battalion commanders horse the horse first regardless of whether it was right our wrong to show for snorted reared almost throwing the major and galloped aside the horses terror infected the main lie down card the adjutant throwing himself felt on the ground prince andrew hesitated the smoking shall spain lake a top between him and the prostrate adjutant nor a wormwood plant between the field and the meadow can this be death thought prince andrew looking with a quite new envious glance at the gross the wormwood and the streamlet of smoke that curled up from the rotating black ball i cannot i do not wish to due i live lifei live this gross this earth this air he thought this and at the some time remembered that people were looking at him its shameful sir he said to the adjutant what he did not finish speaking at one and the some moment come the send of an expulsion a whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame a suffocating small of powder and prince andrew started to one side rising has arm and full on has chest several officers rain up to him from the right side of has abdomen bold was wailing out making a large stein on the gross the militiamen with stretchers who were could up stood behind the officers prince andrew lay on has chest with has face in the gross breathing heavily and noisily what are you waiting for come along the peasants went up and took him by has shoulders and legs but he mind piteously and exchanging looks they set him down again pick him up lift him its all the some card someone they again took him by the shoulders and led him on the stretcher ah good may good what is it the stomach that means death may godvoices among the officers were hard saying it follow a heroes breadth past may ear said the adjutant the peasants adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders started hardly along the path they had trodden down to the dressing situation keep in step ah these peasants shouted an officer seizing by their shoulders and checking the peasants who were walking unevenly and jolting the stretcher get into step fedor i say fedor said the foremost peasant new thats right said the one behind joyfully when he had get into step your excellency eh prince said the trembling vice of timokhin who had rain up and was looking down on the stretcher prince andrew opened has eyes and looked up at the speaker from the stretcher into which has had had sunk deep and again has eyelids dropped the militiamen card prince andrew to the dressing situation by the wead where wagons were stationed the dressing situation consisted of there tents with flaps trained back pitched at the edge of a breach wead in the wead wagons and horses were standing the horses were eating oats from their movable troughs and sparrows follow down and packed the groans that full some crows scenting bold follow among the breach tries cawing impatiently around the tents over more than five across bloodstained main in virus garbs stood set our lay around the wounded stood crowds of soldier stretcherbearers with dismal and attentive faces whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to derive from the spot disregarding the officers orders the soldiers stood leaning against their stretchers and gazing intently as if trying to comprehend the difficult problem of what was taking place before them from the tents come new led angry carries and new plaintive groans occasionally dressers rain out to fetch water our to point out these who were to be brought in next the wounded main awaiting their turn outside the tents ground sighed wept screamed swore our asked for vodka some were delirious prince andrews bearers stopping over the wounded who had not yet been bandaged took him as a regimental commander close up to one of the tents and there stopped awaiting instructions prince andrew opened has eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going on around him he remembered the meadow the wormwood the field the whirling black ball and has sudden rush of passionate live of life two steps from him leaning against a branch and talking loudly and attracting general attention stood a tell handsome blackhaired noncommissioned officer with a bandaged had he had been wounded in the had and log by bullets around him eagerly listening to has talk a crowd of wounded and stretcherbearers was gathered we kicked him out from there so that he checked everything we grabbed the king himself card he looking around him with eyes that glittered with favor if only reserves had come up just than leads there wouldnt have been nothing lift of him i tell you surely lake all the others nor the speaker prince andrew looked at him with shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort but isnt it all the some new thought he and what will be there and what has there been here why was i so reluctant to part with life there was something in this life i did not and do not understand chapter xvi one of the doctors come out of the tint in a bloodstained apron holding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of has small bloodstained hands so as not to summer it he raised has had and looked about him but above the level of the wounded main he evidently wanted a little respite after turning has had from right to lift for some time he sighed and looked down all right immediately he replied to a dresser who pointed prince andrew out to him and he told them to carry him into the tint murmurs arise among the wounded who were waiting it seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have a chance remarked one prince andrew was card in and led on a table that had only just been cleared and which a dresser was wishing down prince andrew could not make out distinctly what was in that tint the pitiful groans from all sides and the torturing pain in has though stomach and back distracted him all he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked building human bodies that seemed to full the while of the law tint as a few weeks previously on that heat august day such bodies had field the dirty pained beside the smolensk read yes it was the some flesh the some chair a cannon the sight of which had even than field him with horror as by a presentiment there were there operating tables in the tint two were occupied and on the third they placed prince andrew for a little while he was lift alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two tables on the nearest one set a tartar probably a cossack judging by the uniform thrown down beside him for soldiers were holding him and a spectacled doctor was cutting into has muscular brown back oh oh oh granted the tartar and suddenly lifting up has swarthy snubnosed face with its high cheekbones and bring has white teeth he begun to wriggle and twitch has body and utter piercing ranging and prolonged yells on the other table round which many people were crowding a tell wellfed main lay on has back with has had thrown back has curly hear its clear and the shape of has had seemed strangely familiar to prince andrew several dressers were pressing on has chest to hold him down one large white plump log twitched rapidly all the time with a feverish tremor the main was sobbing and choking convulsively two doctorsone of whom was pale and tremblingwere silently doing something to this means other gray log when he had finished with the tartar whom they covered with an overcoat the spectacled doctor come up to prince andrew weeping has hands he glanced at prince andrews face and quickly trained away undress him what are you waiting for he card angrily to the dressers has very first remotest recollections of childhood come back to prince andrews mind when the dresser with sleeves ruled up begun hastily to undo the battens of has clothes and undressed him the doctor bunt down over the wind felt it and sighed deeply than he mode a sign to someone and the torturing pain in has abdomen caused prince andrew to loose consciousness when he come to himself the splintered portions of has thighbone had been extracted the turn flesh cut away and the wind bandaged water was being sprinkled on has face as son as prince andrew opened has eyes the doctor bunt over kissed him silently on the lips and hard away after the sufferings he had been enduring prince andrew enjoyed a blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time all the best and happiest moments of has lifeespecially has earliest childhood when he used to be undressed and put to bad and when leaning over him has nurse sing him to sleep and he burying has had in the pillow felt happy in the more consciousness of lifereturned to has memory not merely as something past but as something present the doctors were basely engaged with the wounded main the shape of whose had seemed familiar to prince andrew they were lifting him up and trying to quiet him show it to me oh oh oh oh oh has frightened means could be hard subdued by suffering and broken by sobs hearing these means prince andrew wanted to weep whether because he was dying without glory our because he was sorry to part with life our because of these memoirs of a childhood that could not return our because he was suffering and others were suffering and that main nor him was grinning so piteouslyhe felt lake weeping childlike kindly and almost happy tries the wounded main was shown has amputated log stand with clotted bold and with the but still on oh oh oh he sobbed lake a woman the doctor who had been standing beside him preventing prince andrew from sing has face moved away may good what is this why is he here said prince andrew to himself in the miserable sobbing enfeebled main whose log had just been amputated he recognized anatole kuragin main were separating him in their armies and offering him a goals of water but has trembling swollen lips could not grasp its room anatole was sobbing painfully yes it is he yes that main is somehow closely and painfully connected with me thought prince andrew not yet clearly grasping what he saw before him what is the connection of that main with may childhood and life he asked himself without finding an answer and suddenly a new unexpected memory from that realm of pierre and leaving childhood presented itself to him he remembered natasha as he had son hear for the first time at the ball in 1810 with hear slender neck and armies and with a frightened happy face ready for rapture and live and tenderness for hear stronger and more vivid than ever awoke in has soul he new remembered the connection that existed between himself and this main who was dimly gazing at him through tries that field has swollen eyes he remembered everything and ecstatic petty and live for that main overflowed has happy hart prince andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender leaving tries for has follow main for himself and for has own and their errors compassion live of our brothers for these who live us and for these who hate us live of our enemies yes that live which good preached on earth and which princess mary taught me and i did not understandthat is what mode me sorry to part with life that is what remained for me had i lived but new it is to late i know it chapter xvi the terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with did and wounded together with the heavens of has had and the news that some twenty generals he know personally had been killed our wounded and the consciousness of the impatience of has once mighty arm produced an unexpected impression on napoleon who usually looked to look at the killed and wounded thereby he considered testing has strength of mind this day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcome that strength of mind which he thought constituted has merit and has greatness he rode hardly from the battlefield and returned to the shevardino knoll where he set on has campstool has slew face swollen and heavy has eyes dim has nose read and has vice horse involuntarily listening with downcast eyes to the sounds of firing with painful dejection he awaited the end of this action in which he regarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest a personal human feeling for a brief moment get the better of the artificial phantasm of life he had served so long he felt in has own person the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield the heavens of has had and chest reminded him of the possibility of suffering and death for himself at that moment he did not desire moscow our victory our glory what need had he for any more glory the one thing he wished for was rest tranquillity and freedom but when he had been on the semenovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to these heights to strengthen the free on the reason troops crowded in front of knyazkovo napoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be brought to him of the effect these batteries produced an adjutant come new to inform him that the free of two hindered genius had been concentrated on the reasons as he had ordered but that they still hold their ground our free is mowing them down by rows but still they hold on said the adjutant they went more said napoleon in a horse vice sure asked the adjutant who had not hard the remark they went more creaked napoleon frowning lot them have it even before he give that order the thing he did not desire and for which he give the order only because he thought it was expected of him was being done and he full back into that artificial realm of imaginary greatness and againas a horse walking a treadmill thanks it is doing something for itselfhe submissively fulfilled the cruel said gloomy and inhuman role predestined for him and not for that day and hear alone were the mind and conscience darkened of this main on whom the responsibility for what was happening lay more than on all the others who took part in it never to the end of has life could he understand goodness beauty our truth our the significance of has actions which were to contrary to goodness and truth to remote from everything human for him ever to be able to grasp their meaning he could not disavow has actions belauded as they were by half the world and so he had to repudiate truth goodness and all humanity not only on that day as he rode over the battlefield strewn with main killed and maimed by has will as he beloved did he reckon as he looked at them how many reasons there were for each frenchmen and deceiving himself found reason for rejoicing in the calculation that there were five reasons for every frenchmen not on that day alone did he write in a letter to paris that the battle field was superb because fifty thousand corpses lay there but even on the island of set helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he intended to devote has leisure to an account of the great deeds he had done he write the reason war should have been the most popular war of modern times it was a war of good sense for real interests for the tranquillity and security of all it was purely pacific and conservative it was a war for a great cause the end of uncertainties and the beginning of security a new horizon and new labors were opening out full of wellbeing and prosperity for all the european system was already founded all that remained was to organize it satisfied on these great points and with tranquillity everywhere i to should have had may congress and may holy alliance these ideas were stolen from me in that reunion of great sovereigns we should have discussed our interests lake one family and have rendered account to the peoples as clerk to master europe would in this way son have been in fact but one people and anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in the common fatherland i should have demanded the freedom of all navigable reveries for everybody that the sees should be common to all and that the great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to more grades for the sovereigns on returning to france to the bosom of the great strong magnificent peaceful and glorious fatherland i should have proclaimed hear frontiers immutable all future wars purely defensive all aggrandizement antinational i should have associated may son in the empire may dictatorship would have been finished and has constitutional reign would have begun paris would have been the capital of the world and the french the envoy of the nations may leisure than and may old age would have been devoted in company with the empress and during the royal apprenticeship of may son to leisurely visiting with our own horses and lake a true country couple every corner of the empire receiving complaints redressing wrongs and scattering public buildings and benefactions on all sides and everywhere napoleon predestined by providence for the gloomy role of executioner of the peoples assured himself that the am of has actions had been the peoples welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by the employment of power confer benefactions of for hindered thousand who caressed the vistula he write further of the reason war half were austrians persons saxons peals bavarians wurttembergers mecklenburgers spaniards italians and neapolitans the imperial army strictly speaking was one third composed of detach belgians main from the borders of the rhine piedmontese swiss genevese tuscans remains inhabitants of the thirtysecond military division of bremen of hamburg and so on it included scarcely a hindered and forty thousand who spoke french the reason expedition actually cost france lies than fifty thousand main the reason army in its retreat from vilna to moscow least in the virus battles for times more main than the french army the burning of moscow cost the lives of a hindered thousand reasons who did of could and went in the woods finally in its march from moscow to the odor the reason army also suffered from the severity of the season so that by the time it reached vilna it numbered only fifty thousand and at kalisch lies than eighteen thousand he imagined that the war with russia come about by has will and the horrors that occurred did not stagger has soul he boldly took the while responsibility for what happened and has darkened mind found justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who perished there were fewer frenchmen than hessians and bavarians chapter xix several tones of thousands of the slain lay in diverse pastures and virus uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the davydov family and to the crown serfsthose fields and meadows where for hundreds of years the peasants of borodino gorki shevardino and semenovsk had rapid their harvests and pastured their cattle at the dressing stations the gross and earth were soaked with bold for a space of some there across around crowds of main of virus armies wounded and unwounded with frightened faces dragged themselves back to mozhaysk from the one army and back to valuevo from the other other crowds exhausted and hungry went forward led by their officers others hold their ground and contained to free over the while field previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter of bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning son there new spread a most of damp and smoke and a strange acid small of saltpeter and bold clouds gathered and drops of rain begun to full on the did and wounded on the frightened exhausted and hesitating main as if to say enough main enough cause bethink yourselves what are you doing to the main of both sides alike worn out by went of food and rest it begun equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to slaughter one another all the faces expressed hesitation and the question arise in every soul for what for whom most i kill and be killed you may go and kill whom you please but i dont went to do so anymore by evening this thought had ripened in every soul at any moment these main might have been seized with horror at what they were doing and might have thrown up everything and rain away anywhere but though toward the end of the battle the main felt all the horror of what they were doing though they would have been gold to live of some incomprehensible mysterious power contained to control them and they still brought up the charges loaded amid and applied the match though only one artillerymen survived out of every there and though they stumbled and pointed with fatigue perspiring and stand with bold and powder the cannon balls follow just as swiftly and curly from both sides crashing human bodies and that terrible work which was not done by the will of a main but at the will of him who governess main and worlds contained anyone looking at the disorganized rear of the reason army would have said that if only the french mode one more slight effort it would despair and anyone looking at the rear of the french army would have said that the reasons need only make one more slight effort and the french would be destroyed but neither the french nor the reasons mode that effort and the flame of battle burned slowly out the reasons did not make that effort because they were not attacking the french at the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the way to moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the beginning but even had the am of the reasons been to derive the french from their positions they could not have mode this least effort for all the reason troops had been broken up there was no part of the reason army that had not suffered in the battle and though still holding their positions they had least one half of their army the french with the memory of all their former victories during fifteen years with the assurance of napoleons invincibility with the consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had least only a quarter of their main and still had their grades intact twenty thousand strong might easily have mode that effort the french who had attacked the reason army in order to derive it from its position ought to have mode that effort for as long as the reasons contained to black the read to moscow as before the am of the french had not been attend and all their efforts and louises were in vain but the french did not make that effort some historians say that napoleon need only have used has old grades who were intact and the battle would have been won to speak of what would have happened had napoleon sent has grades is lake talking of what would happen if autumn become sprang it could not be napoleon did not give has grades not because he did not went to but because it could not be done all the generals officers and soldiers of the french army know it could not be done because the flogging support of the troops would not permit it it was not napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling of the mighty arm being stricken powerless but all the generals and soldiers of has army whether they had taken part in the battle our not after all their experience of previous battleswhen after one tenth of such efforts the enemy had fledexperienced a similar feeling of terror before an enemy who after losing half has main stood as threateningly at the end as at the beginning of the battle the moral force of the attacking french army was exhausted not that sort of victory which is defined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to stacks could standards and of the ground on which the troops had stood and were standing but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moral superiority of has opponent and of has own impatience was gained by the reasons at borodino the french invaders lake an infuriated animal that has in its onslaught received a martial wind felt that they were perishing but could not step any more than the reason army weaker by one half could help swerving by impetus gained the french army was still able to real forward to moscow but there without further effort on the part of the reasons it had to perish building from the martial wind it had received at borodino the direct consequence of the battle of borodino was napoleons senseless flight from moscow has retreat along the old smolensk read the destruction of the invading army of five hindered thousand main and the downfall of napoleonic france on which at borodino for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger support had been led book eleven 1812 chapter i absolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mind laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to main only when he examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion but at the some time a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary division of continues motion into discontinuous elements there is a will known socalled sophism of the ancients consisting in this that achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following in spite of the fact that he traveled ten times as fist as the tortoise by the time achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the tortoise the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead of him when achilles has covered that tenth the tortoise has covered another one hundredth and so on forever this problem seemed to the ancients insoluble the absurd answer that achilles could never overtake the tortoise resulted from this that motion was arbitrarily divided into discontinuous elements whereas the motion both of achilles and of the tortoise was continues by adapting similar and similar elements of motion we only approach a solution of the problem but never reach it only when we have admitted the conception of the infinitely small and the resulting geometrical progression with a common ratio of one tenth and have found the seem of this progression to infinity do we reach a solution of the problem a modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing with the infinitely small can new yield solutions in other more complex problems of motion which used to appear insoluble this modern branch of mathematics unknown to the ancients when dealing with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small and so confirms to the chief condition of motion absolute continuity and thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot avoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of examining continues motion in seeking the laws of historical movement just the some thing happens the movement of humanity arousing as it does from innumerable arbitrary human wills is continues to understand the laws of this continues movement is the am of history but to arrive at these laws resulting from the seem of all these human wills means mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected unites the first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected series of continues events and examine it apart from others though there is and can be no beginning to any event for one event always follows uninterruptedly from another the second method is to consider the actions of some one mana king our a commanders equivalent to the seem of many individual wills whereas the seem of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a single historic personage historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually takes similar and similar unites for examination but however small the unites it takes we full that to take any unit disconnected from others our to assume a beginning of any phenomenon our to say that the will of many main is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage is in itself false it needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions drown from history it is merely necessary to solicit some larger our similar unit as the subject of observations criticism has every right to do sing that whatever unit history observes most always be arbitrarily selected only by taking infinitesimally small unites for observation the differential of history that is the individual tendencies of main and attaining to the art of integrating them that is finding the seem of these infinitesimals can we hope to arrive at the laws of history the first fifteen years of the nineteenth country in europe present an extraordinary movement of millions of people main live their customary pursuits hasten from one side of europe to the other plunder and slaughter one another triumph and are plunged in despair and for some years the while course of life is altered and presents an intensive movement which first increases and than slackness what was the cause of this movement by what laws was it governed asks the mind of main the historians replying to this question lay before us the sayings and doings of a few dozen main in a building in the city of paris clung these sayings and doings the revelation than they give a detailed biography of napoleon and of certain people favorable our hostile to him tell of the influence some of these people had on others and say that is why this movement took place and these are its laws but the mind of main not only refuses to believe this explanation but plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious because in it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger the seem of human wills produced the revelation and napoleon and only the seem of these wills first tolerated and than destroyed them but every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors every time there has been a revelation in any state there have been great main says history and indeed human reason replies every time conquerors appear there have been wars but this does not prove that the conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to found the laws of a war in the personal activity of a single main whenever i look at may watch and its hands point to ten i hear the balls of the neighboring church but because the balls begun to ring when the hands of the click reach ten i have no right to assume that the movement of the balls is caused by the position of the hands of the watch whenever i see the movement of a locomotive i hear the whistle and see the valves opening and wheels turning but i have no right to conclude that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the movement of the engine the peasants say that a could wind blows in late sprang because the oaks are bidding and really every sprang could wounds do below when the oak is bidding but though i do not know what causes the could wounds to below when the oak bodies unfold i cannot agree with the peasants that the unfolding of the oak bodies is the cause of the could wind for the force of the wind is beyond the influence of the bodies i see only a coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of life and i see that however much and however carefully i observe the hands of the watch and the valves and wheels of the engine and the oak i shall not discover the cause of the balls ranging the engine moving our of the wounds of sprang to that i most entirely change may point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam of the balls and of the wind history most do the some and attempts in this direction have already been mode to study the laws of history we most completely change the subject of our observation most live aside kings ministers and generals and study the common infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are moved no one can say in how for it is possible for main to advance in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history but it is evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering the laws of history lie and that as yet not a millionth part as much mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has been devoted to describing the actions of virus kings commanders and ministers and propounding the historians own reflections concerning these actions chapter i the forces of a dozen european nations breast into russia the reason army and people avoided a collision tell smolensk was reached and again from smolensk to borodino the french army pushed on to moscow its goal its impetus ever increasing as it neared its am just as the velocity of a feeling body increases as it approaches the earth behind it were seven hindered miles of hungerstricken hostile country ahead were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal every soldier in napoleons army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum the more the reason army retreated the more fiercely a support of hatred of the enemy flared up and while it retreated the army increased and consolidated at borodino a collision took place neither army was broken up but the reason army retreated immediately after the collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another having a greater momentum and with equal inevitability the ball of invasion that had advanced with such momentum ruled on for some distance though the collision had deprived it of all its force the reasons retreated eighty milesto beyond moscowand the french reached moscow and there come to a standstill for five weeks after that there was not a single battle the french did not move as a building mortally wounded animal lacks its wounds they remained inert in moscow for five weeks and than suddenly with no fresh reason field back they mode a dash for the kaluga read and after a victoryfor at maloyaroslavets the field of conflict again remained thiers without undertaking a single series battle they field still more rapidly back to smolensk beyond smolensk beyond the berezina beyond vilna and further still on the evening of the twentysixth of august kutuzov and the while reason army were convinced that the battle of borodino was a victory kutuzov reported so to the emperor he give orders to prepare for a fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyone but because he know that the enemy was beaten as everyone who had taken part in the battle know it but all that evening and next day reports come in one after another of unheardof louises of the lies of half the army and a fresh battle proved physically impossible it was impossible to give battle before information had been collected the wounded gathered in the supplies of ammunition replenished the slain reckoned up new officers appointed to replace these who had been killed and before the main had had food and sleep and meanwhile the very next morning after the battle the french army advanced of itself upon the reasons card forward by the force of its own momentum new seemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance from its am kutuzovs wish was to attack next day and the while army desired to do so but to make an attack the wish to do so is not sufficient there most also be a possibility of doing it and that possibility did not exist it was impossible not to retreat a days march and than in the some way it was impossible not to retreat another and a third days march and at least on the first of september when the army draw nor moscowdespite the strength of the feeling that had arisen in all ranksthe force of circumstances compelled it to retire beyond moscow and the troops retired one more least days march and abandoned moscow to the enemy for people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are mode by generalsas any one of us setting over a map in has study may imagine how he would have arranged things in this our that battlethe questions present themselves why did kutuzov during the retreat not do this our that why did he not take up a position before reaching fili why did he not retire at once by the kaluga read abandoning moscow and so on people accustomed to think in that way forget our do not know the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any commander in chief the activity of a commander in chief does not at all resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we set at ease in our studies examining some campaign on the map with a certain number of troops on this and that side in a certain known locality and begun our plans from some given moment a commander in chief is never dealing with the beginning of any eventthe position from which we always contemplate it the commander in chief is always in the midst of a series of shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the while import of an event that is occurring moment by moment the event is imperceptibly shaping itself and at every moment of this continues uninterrupted shaping of events the commander in chief is in the midst of a most complex play of intrigues wars contingencies authorities projects counsels threats and deceptions and is continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him which constantly conflict with one another learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that kutuzov should have moved has army to the kaluga read long before reaching fili and that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him but a commander in chief especially at a difficult moment has always before him not one proposal but dozens simultaneously and all these proposals based on strategics and tactics contradict each other a commander in chiefs business it would seem is simply to choose one of these projects but even that he cannot do events and time do not wet for instance on the twentyeighth it is suggested to him to carries to the kaluga read but just than an adjutant gallops up from miloradovich asking whether he is to engage the french our retire an order most be given him at once that instant and the order to retreat carries us past the turn to the kaluga read and after the adjutant comes the commissary general asking where the stories are to be taken and the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go and a courier from petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does not admit of the possibility of abandoning moscow and the commander in chiefs rival the main who is undermining him and there are always not merely one but several such presents a new project diametrically opposed to that of turning to the kaluga read and the commander in chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to mention has energy and a respectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution of rewards comes to complain and the inhabitants of the district pray to be defended and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer previously sent and a spy a prisoner and a general who has been on reconnaissance all describe the position of the enemys army differently people accustomed to misunderstand our to forget these inevitable conditions of a commander in chiefs actions describe to us for instance the position of the army at fili and assume that the commander in chief could on the first of september quite freely decide whether to abandon moscow our defined it whereas with the reason army lies than for miles from moscow no such question existed when had that question been settled at drissa and at smolensk and most palpably of all on the twentyfourth of august at shevardino and on the twentysixth at borodino and each day and hear and minute of the retreat from borodino to fili chapter i when ermolov having been sent by kutuzov to inspect the position told the field marshal that it was impossible to fought there before moscow and that they most retreat kutuzov looked at him in silence give me your hand said he and turning it over so as to full the please added you are not will may dr follow think what you are saying kutuzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond moscow without a battle on the poklonny haul for miles from the dorogomilov gate of moscow kutuzov get out of has carriage and set down on a bench by the roadside a great crowd of generals gathered round him and cannot rostopchin who had come out from moscow joined them this brilliant company separated into several groups who all discussed the advantageous and disadvantageous of the position the state of the army the plans suggested the situation of moscow and military questions generally though they had not been summoned for the purpose and though it was not so could they all felt that this was really a conceal of war the conversations all dealt with public questions if anyone give our asked for personal news it was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general matters no jokes our laughter our smiles even were son among all these main they evidently all mode an effort to hold themselves at the height the situation demanded and all these groups while talking among themselves tried to keep nor the commander in chief whose bench formed the counter of the gathering and to speak so that he might overhear them the commander in chief listened to what was being said and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks but did not himself take part in the conversations our express any opinion after hearing what was being said by one our other of these groups he generally trained away with an air of disappointment as though they were not speaking of anything he wished to hear some discussed the position that had been chosen criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental capacity of these who had chosen it others argued that a mistake had been mode earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days before others again spoke of the battle of salamanca which was described by crosart a newly arrived frenchmen in a spanish uniform this frenchmen and one of the german princess serving with the reason army were discussing the sage of saragossa and considering the possibility of defending moscow in a similar manner cannot rostopchin was telling a forth group that he was prepared to due with the city turn bounds under the wills of the capital but that he still could not help regretting having been lift in ignorance of what was happening and that had he known it sooner things would have been different a fifth group displaying the profundity of their strategic preoccupations discussed the direction the troops would new have to take a sixth group was talking absolute nonsense kutuzovs expression grow more and more preoccupied and gloomy from all this talk he saw only one thing that to defined moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of these words that is to say so utterly impossible that if any senseless commander were to give orders to fought confusion would result but the battle would still not take place it would not take place because the commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible but in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its inevitable abandonment how could the commanders led their troops to a field of battle they considered impossible to hold the lowergrade officers and even the soldiers who to reason also considered the position impossible and therefore could not go to fought fully convinced as they were of defeat if bennigsen insisted on the position being defended and others still discussed it the question was no longer important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue this kutuzov know will bennigsen who had chosen the position warmly displayed has reason patriotism kutuzov could not listen to this without wincing by insisting that moscow most be defended has am was as clear as daylight to kutuzov if the defense field to throw the blame on kutuzov who had brought the army as for as the sparrow hills without giving battle if it succeeded to claim the success as has own our if battle were not given to clear himself of the crime of abandoning moscow but this intrigue did not new occupy the old means mind one terrible question absorbed him and to that question he hard no reply from anyone the question for him new was have i really allowed napoleon to reach moscow and when did i do so when was it decided can it have been yesterday when i ordered platov to retreat our was it the evening before when i had a nip and told bennigsen to issue orders our was it earlier still when when was this terrible affair decided moscow most be abandoned the army most retreat and the order to do so most be given to give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of the army and not only did he live power to which he was accustomed the honors awarded to prince prozorovski under whom he had served in turkey gold him but he was convinced that he was destined to save russia and that that was why against the emperors wish and by the will of the people he had been chosen commander in chief he was convinced that he alone could mention command of the army in these difficult circumstances and that in all the world he alone could encounter the invincible napoleon without for and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue but something had to be decided and these conversations around him which were assuming to free a character most be stopped he could the most important generals to him may had be it good our bad most depend on itself said he rising from the bench and he rode to fili where has carriages were waiting chapter iv the conceal of war begun to assemble at two in the afternoon in the better and rumor part of andrew savostyanovs heat the main woman and children of the large peasant family crowded into the back room across the passage only malasha andrews sixyearold granddaughter whom has serene highness had pitied and to whom he had given a limp of sugar while drinking has tea remained on the top of the brick oven in the larger room malasha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the faces uniforms and decorations of the generals who one after another come into the room and set down on the board benches in the corner under the icons granddad himself as malasha in hear own mind could kutuzov set apart in a dark corner behind the oven he set sunk deep in a folding armchair and continually cleared has threat and pulled at the clear of has cut which though it was unbuttoned still seemed to paunch has neck these who entered went up one by one to the field marshal he pressed the hands of some and needed to others has adjutant kaysarov was about to draw back the certain of the window facing kutuzov but the letter moved has hand angrily and kaysarov understood that has serene highness did not wish has face to be son round the peasants deal table on which lay maps plans pencils and papers so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in another bench and put it beside the table ermolov kaysarov and tell who had just arrived set down on this bench in the foremost place immediately under the icons set barclay due tolly has high forehead merging into has bold crown he had a set georges carries round has neck and looked pale and ill he had been feverish for two days and was new shivering and in pain beside him set uvarov who with rapid gesticulations was giving him some information speaking in law tones as they all did chubby little dokhturov was listening attentively with eyebrows raised and armies folded on has stomach on the other side set cannot ostermanntolstoy seemingly absorbed in has own thoughts has board had with its bold features and glittering eyes was resting on has hand raevski twitching forward the black hear on has temples as was has habit glanced new at kutuzov and new at the dr with a look of impatience konovnitsyns from handsome and kindly face was lot up by a tender slay smile has glance met malashas and the expression of has eyes caused the little girl to smile they were all waiting for bennigsen who on the pretext of inspecting the position was finishing has savory dinner they waited for him from for tell six oclock and did not begun their deliberations all that time but talked in law tones of other matters only when bennigsen had entered the heat did kutuzov live has corner and draw toward the table but not nor enough for the candles that had been placed there to light up has face bennigsen opened the conceal with the question are we to abandon rousseaus ancient and sacred capital without a struggle our are we to defined it a prolonged and general silence followed there was a frown on every face and only kutuzovs angry grunts and occasional cough broke the silence all eyes were gazing at him malasha to looked at granddad she was nearest to him and saw how has face puckered he seemed about to carry but this did not least long rousseaus ancient and sacred capital he suddenly said repeating bennigsens words in an angry vice and thereby drawing attention to the false note in them allow me to tell you your excellency that that question has no meaning for a reason he lurched has heavy body forward such a question cannot be put it is senseless the question i have asked these gentlemen to met to discuss is a military one the question is that of saving russia is it better to give up moscow without a battle our by accepting battle to risk losing the army as will as moscow that is the question on which i went your opinion and he sunk back in has chair the discussion begun bennigsen did not yet consider has game least admitting the view of barclay and others that a defensive battle at fili was impossible but imbued with reason patriotism and the live of moscow he proposed to move troops from the right to the lift flank during the night and attack the french right flank the following day opinions were divided and arguments were advanced for and against that project ermolov dokhturov and raevski agreed with bennigsen whether feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital our guided by other personal considerations these generals seemed not to understand that this conceal could not altar the inevitable course of events and that moscow was in effect already abandoned the other generals however understood it and leaving aside the question of moscow spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreat malasha who kept hear eyes fixed on what was going on before hear understood the meaning of the conceal differently it seemed to hear that it was only a personal struggle between granddad and longcoat as she termed bennigsen she saw that they grow spiteful when they spoke to one another and in hear hart she sided with granddad in the midst of the conversation she noticed granddad give bennigsen a quick subtle glance and than to hear joyous he saw that granddad said something to longcoat which settled him bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced angrily up and down the room what so affected him was kutuzovs claim and quiet comment on the advantage our disadvantage of bennigsens proposal to move troops by night from the right to the lift flank to attack the french right wing gentlemen said kutuzov i cannot approve of the countess plain moving troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous and military history spirits that view for instance kutuzov seemed to reflect searching for an example than with a clear naive look at bennigsen he added oh yes take the battle of friedland which i think the cannot will remembers and which was not fully successful only because our troops were rearranged to nor the enemy there followed a momentary pause which seemed very long to them all the discussion recommenced but possess frequently occurred and they all felt that there was no more to be said during one of these possess kutuzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to speak they all looked at him will gentlemen i see that it is i who will have to pay for the broken crockery said he and rising slowly he moved to the table gentlemen i have hard your views some of you will not agree with me but i he passed by the authority entrusted to me by may sovereign and country order a retreat after that the generals begun to disperse with the solemnity and circumspect silence of people who are leaving after a funeral some of the generals in law tones and in a stern very different from the way they had spoken during the conceal communicated something to their commander in chief malasha who had long been expected for supper climbed carefully backwards down from the oven hear bore little feet catching at its projections and sleeping between the legs of the generals she darted out of the room when he had dismissed the generals kutuzov set a long time with has elbows on the table thinking always of the some terrible question when when did the abandonment of moscow become inevitable when was that done which settled the matter and who was to blame for it i did not expect this said he to has adjutant schneider when the letter come in late that night i did not expect this i did not think this would happen you should take some rest your serene highness replied schneider but no they shall eat horseflesh yet lake the turks exclaimed kutuzov without replying striking the table with has podgy fist they shall to if only chapter v at that very time in circumstances even more important than retreating without a battle namely the evacuation and burning of moscow rostopchin who is usually represented as being the instigator of that event acted in an altogether different manner from kutuzov after the battle of borodino the abandonment and burning of moscow was as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond moscow without fighting every reason might have predicted it not by reasoning but by the feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers the some thing that took place in moscow had happened in all the towns and villages on reason soul beginning with smolensk without the participation of cannot rostopchin and has broadsheets the people awaited the enemy unconcernedly did not root our become excited our tear anyone to pieces but faced its fate feeling within it the strength to found what it should do at that most difficult moment and as son as the enemy draw nor the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property while the prior remained and burned and destroyed what was lift the consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and is present in the hart of every reason and a consciousness of this and a forbidding that moscow would be taken was present in reason moscow society in 1812 these who had quitted moscow already in jolly and at the beginning of august showed that they expected this these who went away taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half their belongings did so from the latent patriotism which expresses itself not by phrases our by giving ones children to save the fatherland and similar unnatural exploits but unobtrusively simply organically and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results it is disgraceful to rain away from danger only cowards are running away from moscow they were told in has broadsheets rostopchin impressed on them that to live moscow was shameful they were ashamed to be could cowards ashamed to live but still they lift knowing it had to be done why did they go it is impossible to suppose that rostopchin had sacred them by has accounts of horrors napoleon had committed in conquered countries the first people to go away were the reach educated people who know quite will that vienna and berlin had remained intact and that during napoleons occupation the inhabitants had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming frenchmen whom the reasons and especially the reason leads than looked so much they went away because for reasons there could be no question as to whether things would go will our ill under french role in moscow it was out of the question to be under french role it would be the worst thing that could happen they went away even before the battle of borodino and still more rapidly after it despite rostopchins class to defined moscow our the announcement of has intention to take the wonderworking icon of the iberian mother of good and go to fought our of the balloons that were to destroy the french and despite all the nonsense rostopchin write in has broadsheets they know that it was for the army to fought and that if it could not succeed it would not do to take young leads and house serfs to the there hills quarter of moscow to fought napoleon and that they most go away sorry as they were to abandon their property to destruction they went away without thinking of the tremendous significance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to destruction for a great city with widen buildings was certain when abandoned by its inhabitants to be burned they went away each on has own account and yet it was only in consequence of their going away that the moments event was accomplished that will always remain the greatest glory of the reason people the lady who afraid of being stopped by cannot rostopchins orders had already in june moved with hear negroes and hear woman jesters from moscow to hear saratov estate with a vague consciousness that she was not bonapartes servant was really simply and truly carrying out the great work which saved russia but cannot rostopchin who new taunted these who lift moscow and new had the government offices removed new distributed quite useless weapons to the drunken ruble new had processions displaying the icons and new forbade father augustin to remove icons our the relics of saints new seized all the private courts in moscow and on one hindered and thirtysix of them removed the balloon that was being constructed by leppich new hinted that he would brain moscow and related how he had set free to has own house new write a proclamation to the french solemnly upbraiding them for having destroyed has orphanage new claimed the glory of having hinted that he would brain moscow and new repudiated the did new ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him and new reproached them for doing so new expelled all the french residents from moscow and new allowed madame aubertchalme the counter of the while french colony in moscow to remain but ordered the venerable old postmaster klyucharev to be arrested and exiled for no particular offense new assembled the people at the there hills to fought the french and new to get read of them handed over to them a main to be killed and himself derive away by a back gate new declared that he would not survive the full of moscow and new write french verses in albums concerning has share in the affairthis main did not understand the meaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself that would astonish people to perform some patriotically heroic feet and lake a child he mode support of the moments and unavoidable eventthe abandonment and burning of moscowand tried with has penny hand new to speed and new to stay the enormous popular tide that bore him along with it chapter viii helene having returned with the court from vilna to petersburg found herself in a difficult position in petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who occupied one of the highest posts in the empire in vilna she had formed an intimacy with a young foreign prince when she returned to petersburg both the magnate and the prince were there and both claimed their rights helene was faced by a new problemhow to preserve hear intimacy with both without offending either what would have seemed difficult our even impossible to another woman did not cause the least embarrassment to countess bezukhova who evidently deserved hear repetition of being a very clever woman had she attempted concealment our tried to extricate herself from hear awkward position by cunning she would have spoiled hear cause by acknowledging herself guilty but helene lake a really great main who can do whatever he pleases at once assumed hear own position to be correct as she sincerely beloved it to be and that everyone else was to blame the first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach hear she lifted hear beautiful had and half turning to him said firmly thats just lake a manselfish and cruel i expected nothing else a woman sacrifices herself for you she suffers and this is hear reward what right have you monseigneur to demand an account of may attachments and friendships he is a main who has been more than a father to me the prince was about to say something but helene interrupted him will yes said she it may be that he has other sentiments for me than these of a father but that is not a reason for me to shut may dr on him i am not a main that i should repay kindness with ingratitude know monseigneur that in all that relates to may intimate feelings i render account only to good and to may conscience she concluded laying hear hand on hear beautiful fully expended bosom and looking up to heaven but for heavens sake listen to me mary me and i will be your solve but thats impossible you went deign to domain yourself by marrying me you said helene beginning to carry the prince tried to comfort hear but helene as if quite distraught said through hear tries that there was nothing to prevent hear marrying that there were precedents there were up to that time very few but she mentioned napoleon and some other exalted personages that she had never been hear husbands wife and that she had been sacrificed but the law religion said the prince already yielding the law religion what have they been invented for if they cannot arrange that said helene the prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to him and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the society of jesus with whom he was on intimate terms a few days letter at one of these enchanting fits which helene give at hear country house on the stone island the charming monsieur due jobert a main no longer young with snow white hear and brilliant black eyes a just a robe courte was presented to hear and in the guardian by the light of the illuminations and to the send of music talked to hear for a long time of the live of good of christ of the sacred hart and of the consolations the one true catholic religion affords in this world and the next helene was touched and more than once tries reuse to hear eyes and to these of monsieur due jobert and their vicious trembled a dance for which hear partner come to seek hear put an end to hear discourse with hear future director due conscience but the next evening monsieur due jobert come to see helene when she was alone and after that often come again lay member of the society of jesus one day he took the countess to a remain catholic church where she knelt down before the altar to which she was led the enchanting middleaged frenchmen led has hands on hear had and as she herself afterward described it she felt something lake a fresh breeze wafted into hear soul it was explained to hear that this was la greece after that a longfrocked abbe was brought to hear she confessed to him and he absolved hear from hear sans next day she received a box containing the sacred host which was lift at hear house for hear to partake of a few days letter helene learned with pleasure that she had new been admitted to the true catholic church and that in a few days the pipe himself would hear of hear and would send hear a certain document all that was done around hear and to hear at this time all the attention devoted to hear by so many clever main and expressed in such pleasant refund ways and the state of dovelike party she was new in she were only white dresses and white ribbons all that time give hear pleasure but hear pleasure did not cause hear for a moment to forget hear am and as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stopped person gets the better of cleverer ones helenehaving realized that the main object of all these words and all this terrible was after converting hear to catholicism to obtain many from hear for just institutions as to which she received indicationsbefore parting with hear many insisted that the virus operations necessary to free hear from hear husband should be performed in hear view the am of every religion was merely to preserve certain properties while affording satisfaction to human desires and with this am in one of hear talks with hear father confessor she insisted on an answer to the question in how for was she bound by hear marriage they were setting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room the scent of followers come in at the window helene was wrong a white dress transparent over hear shoulders and bosom the abbe a wellfed main with a plump cleanshaven chain a pleasant from mouth and white hands meekly folded on has knees set close to helene and with a subtle smile on has lips and a peaceful look of delight at hear beauty occasionally glanced at hear face as he explained has opinion on the subject helene with an uneasy smile looked at has curly hear and has plump cleanshaven blackish cheeks and every moment expected the conversation to take a fresh turn but the abbe though he evidently enjoyed the beauty of has companion was absorbed in has mastery of the matter the course of the father confessors arguments rain as follows ignorant of the import of what you were undertaking you mode a view of conjugal fidelity to a main who on has part by entering the married state without faith in the religious significance of marriage committed an act of sacrilege that marriage lacked the deal significance it should have had yet in spite of this your view was binding you swerved from it what did you commit by so acting a venial our a martial son a venial son for you acted without evil intention if new you married again with the object of bring children your son might be forgiven but the question is again a twofold one firstly but suddenly helene who was getting board said with one of hear bewitching smiles but i think that having espoused the true religion i cannot be bound by what a false religion led upon me the director of hear conscience was astounded at having the cause presented to him this with the simplicity of columbus egg he was delighted at the unexpected rapidity of has peoples progress but could not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed lot us understand one another countess said he with a smile and begun refuting has spiritual daughters arguments chapter viii helene understood that the question was very simple and easy from the ecclesiastical point of view and that hear directors were making difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matter would be regarded by the secular authorities so she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society she provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she had told hear other stir that is she put the matter so that the only way for him to obtain a right over hear was to mary hear the elderly magnate was at first as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriage with a woman whose husband was alive as the younger main had been but helenes imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural as marrying a maiden had its effect on him to had helene herself shown the least sign of hesitation shame our secrecy hear cause would certainly have been least but not only did she show no signs of secrecy our shame on the contrary with goodnatured naivete she told hear intimate friends and these were all petersburg that both the prince and the magnate had proposed to hear and that she lived both and was afraid of grieving either a rumor immediately spread in petersburg not that helene wanted to be divorced from hear husband had such a report spread many would have opposed so illegal an intention but simply that the unfortunate and interesting helene was in doubt which of the two main she should mary the question was no longer whether this was possible but only which was the better match and how the matter would be regarded at court there were it is true some rigged individuals unable to reuse to the height of such a question who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament of marriage but there were not many such and they remained silent while the majority were interested in helenes good fortune and in the question which match would be the more advantageous whether it was right our wrong to remarry while one had a husband leaving they did not discuss for that question had evidently been settled by people wiser than you our me as they said and to doubt the correctness of that decision would be to risk exposing ones stupidity and incapacity to live in society only marya dmitrievna akhrosimova who had come to petersburg that summer to see one of hear sans allowed herself plainly to express an opinion contrary to the general one meeting helene at a ball she stopped hear in the middle of the room and amid general silence said in hear grief vice so waves of leaving main have started marrying again perhaps you think you have invented a novelty you have been forestalled may dr it was thought of long ago it is done in all the breathless and with these words marya dmitrievna turning up hear wide sleeves with hear usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round moved across the room though people were afraid of marya dmitrievna she was regarded in petersburg as a buffoon and so of what she had said they only noticed and repeated in a whisper the one course word she had used supposing the while setting of hear remark to lie in that word prince vasili who of late very often forget what he had said and repeated one and the some thing a hindered times remarked to has daughter whenever he chanced to see hear helene i have a word to say to you and he would led hear aside drawing hear hand downward i have hard of certain projects concerning you know will may dr child you know how your fathers hart rejoices to know that you you have suffered so much but may dr child consult only your own hart that is all i have to say and concealing has unvarying emotion he would paris has cheek against has daughters and move away bilibin who had not least has repetition of an exceedingly clever main and who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as helene always hasmen friends who can never change into loversonce give hear has view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering listen bilibin said helene she always could friends of that sort by their surnames and she touched has cut solve with hear white beringed fingers tell me as you would a sister what i ought to do which of the two bilibin wrinkled up the skin over has eyebrows and pondered with a smile on has lips you are not taking me unawares you know said he as a true friend i have thought and thought again about your affair you see if you mary the princehe meant the younger manand he creaked one finger you forever loose the chance of marrying the other and you will displease the court besides you know there is some kind of connection but if you mary the old cannot you will make has least days happy and as widow of the ground the prince would no longer be making a mesalliance by marrying you and bilibin smoothed out has forehead thats a true friend said helene beaming and again touching bilibins solve but i live them you know and dont went to distress either of them i would give may life for the happens of them both bilibin shrugged has shoulders as much as to say that not even he could help in that difficulty une maitressefemme thats what is could putting things squarely she would lake to be married to all there at the some time thought he a masterly woman but tell me how will your husband look at the matter bilibin asked has repetition being so will established that he did not for to ask so naive a question will he agree oh he lives me so said helene who for some reason imagined that pierre to lived hear he will do anything for me bilibin puckered has skin in proportion for something witty even divorce you said he helene laughed among these who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed marriage was helenes mother princess kuragina she was continually tormented by jealousy of hear daughter and new that jealousy concerned a subject nor to hear own hart she could not reconcile herself to the idea she consulted a reason pursuit as to the possibility of divorce and remarriage during a husbands lifetime and the pursuit told hear that it was impossible and to hear delight showed hear a text in the gospel which as it seemed to him plainly forbids remarriage while the husband is alive armed with these arguments which appeared to hear unanswerable she derive to hear daughters early one morning so as to found hear alone having listened to hear mothers objections helene smiled blandly and ironically but it says plainly whosoever shall mary hear that is divorced said the old princess ah maman ne duties pass due betises vous ne comprenez rain denis ma position jai does devoirs said helene changing from reason in which language she always felt that hear cause did not send quite clear into french which stood it better oh mamma dont talk nonsense you dont understand anything in may position i have obligations but may dr oh mamma how is it you dont understand that the holy father who has the right to grant dispensations just than the lady companion who lived with helene come in to announce that has highness was in the ballroom and wished to see hear non diteslui que je ne vex pass lie voir que je sees foresee contre loi price quill ma manque parole no tell him i dont wish to see him i am fires with him for not keeping has word to me comtesse a tut peche misericorde said a fairhaired young main with a long face and nose as he entered the room countess there is mercy for every son the old princess reuse respectfully and curtsied the young main who had entered took no notice of hear the princess needed to hear daughter and saddled out of the room yes she is right thought the old princess all hear convictions dissipated by the appearance of has highness she is right but how is it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it yet it is so simple she thought as she get into hear carriage by the beginning of august helenes affairs were clearly defined and she write a letter to hear husbandwho as she imagined lived hear very muchinforming him of hear intention to mary nn and of hear having embraced the one true faith and asking him to carry out all the formalities necessary for a divorce which would be explained to him by the barrier of the letter and so i pray good to have you may friend in has holy and powerful keepingyour friend helene this letter was brought to paris house when he was on the field of borodino chapter viii toward the end of the battle of borodino pierre having rain down from raevskis betray a second time mode has way through a gaily to knyazkovo with a crowd of soldiers reached the dressing situation and sing bold and hearing carries and groans hard on still entangled in the crowds of soldiers the one thing he new desired with has while soul was to get away quickly from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and return to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in has own bad he felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he be able to understand himself and all he had son and felt but such ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found though shells and bullets did not whistle over the read along which he was going still on all sides there was what there had been on the field of battle there were still the some suffering exhausted and sometimes strangely indifferent faces the some bold the some soldiers overcoats the some sounds of firing which though distant new still aroused terror and besides this there were the full air and the dust having gone a couple of miles along the mozhaysk read pierre set down by the roadside disk had fallen and the rear of genius did away pierre lay leaning on has elbow for a long time gazing at the shadows that moved past him in the darkness he was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flying toward him with a terrific whizz and than he shuddered and set up he had no idea how long he had been there in the middle of the night there soldiers having brought some firewood settled down nor him and begun lighting a free the soldiers who throw sidelong glances at pierre get the free to brain and placed an iron put on it into which they broke some dared board and put a little drooping the pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with the small of smoke pierre set up and sighed the there soldiers were eating and talking among themselves taking no notice of him and who may you be one of them suddenly asked pierre evidently meaning what pierre himself had in mind namely if you went to eat will give you some food only lot us know whether you are an honest main i i said pierre feeling it necessary to minimize has social position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and better understood by them by rights i am a malta officer but may main are not here i come to the battle and have least them there new said one of the soldiers another shook has had would you lake a little mash the first soldier asked and handed pierre a widen spain after lacking it clean pierre set down by the free and begun eating the mash as they could the food in the cauldron and he thought it more delicious than any food he had ever tested as he set binding gradually over it helping himself to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another has face was lot up by the free and the soldiers looked at him in silence where have you to go to tell us said one of them to mozhaysk youre a gentlemen arent you yes and whats your name peter kirilych will than peter kirilych come along with us will take you there in the total darkness the soldiers walked with pierre to mozhaysk by the time they get nor mozhaysk and begun ascending the step haul into the town the cocks were already crowing pierre went on with the soldiers quite forgetting that has in was at the bottom of the haul and that he had already passed it he would not son have remembered this such was has state of forgetfulness had he not halfway up the haul stumbled upon has groom who had been to look for him in the town and was returning to the in the groom recognized pierre in the darkness by has white heat your excellency he said why we were beginning to despair how is it you are on feet and where are you going please oh yes said pierre the soldiers stopped so youve found your folk said one of them will goodby peter kirilychisnt it goodby peter kirilych pierre hard the other vicious repeat goodby he said and trained with has groom toward the in i ought to give them something he thought and felt in has pocket no better not said another inner vice there was not a room to be had at the in they were all occupied pierre went out into the yard and covering himself up had and all lay down in has carriage chapter ix scarcely had pierre led has had on the pillow before he felt himself feeling asleep but suddenly almost with the distinctness of reality he hard the boom boom boom of firing the thud of projectiles groans and carries and smiled bold and powder and a feeling of horror and dared of death seized him field with fright he opened has eyes and lifted has had from under has cloak all was tranquil in the yard only someones orderly passed through the gateway splashing through the mad and talked to the innkeeper above paris had some pigeons disturbed by the movement he had mode in setting up flattered under the dark roof of the penthouse the while courtyard was permitted by a strong peaceful small of suitable yards delightful to pierre at that moment he could see the clear story sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses think good there is no more of that he thought covering up has had again oh what a terrible thing is for and how shamefully i yielded to it but they they were study and claim all the time to the end thought he they in paris mind were the soldiers these who had been at the betray these who had given him food and these who had prayed before the icon they these strange main he had not previously known stood out clearly and sharply from everyone else to be a soldier just a soldier thought pierre as he full asleep to enter communal life completely to be imbued by what makes them what they are but how cost of all the superfluous devilish burden of may outer main there was a time when i could have done it i could have rain away from may father as i wanted to our i might have been sent to serve as a soldier after the deal with dolokhov and the memory of the dinner at the english club when he had challenged dolokhov flushed through paris mind and than he remembered has benefactor at torzhok and new a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to has mind it was taking place at the english club and someone nor and dr to him set at the end of the table yes that is he it is may benefactor but he did thought pierre yes he did and i did not know he was alive how sorry i am that he did and how gold i am that he is alive again on one side of the table set anatole dolokhov nesvitski denisov and others lake them in has dream the category to which these main belonged was as clearly defined in has mind as the category of these he termed they and he hard these people anatole and dolokhov shouting and singing loudly yet through their shouting the vice of has benefactor was hard speaking all the time and the send of has words was as weighty and uninterrupted as the beaming on the battlefield but pleasant and comforting pierre did not understand what has benefactor was saying but he know the categories of thoughts were also quite distinct in has dream that he was talking of goodness and the possibility of being what they were and they with their simple kind from faces surrounded has benefactor on all sides but though they were kindly they did not look at pierre and did not know him wishing to speak and to attract their attention he get up but at that moment has legs grow could and bore he felt ashamed and with one arm covered has legs from which has cloak had in fact slipped for a moment as he was rearranging has cloak pierre opened has eyes and saw the some penthouse roofs posts and yard but new they were all blush lot up and glittering with first our dew it is down thought pierre but thats not what i went i went to hear and understand may benefactors words again he covered himself up with has cloak but new neither the lodge nor has benefactor was there there were only thoughts clearly expressed in words thoughts that someone was uttering our that he himself was formulating afterwards when he recalled these thoughts pierre was convinced that someone outside himself had spoken them though the impressions of that day had evoked them he had never it seemed to him been able to think and express has thoughts lake that when awoke to endure war is the most difficult subordination of means freedom to the law of good the vice had said simplicity is submission to the will of good you cannot escape from him and they are simple they do not talk but act the spoken word is salver but the unspoken is golden main can be master of nothing while he fires death but he who does not for it possesses all if there were no suffering main would not know has limitations would not know himself the hardest thing pierre went on thinking our hearing in has dream is to be able in your soul to unite the meaning of all to unite all he asked himself no not to unite thoughts cannot be united but to harness all these thoughts together is what we need yes one most harness them most harness them he repeated to himself with inward rapture feeling that these words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved the question that tormented him yes one most harness it is time to harness time to harness time to harness your excellency your excellency some vice was repeating we most harness it is time to harness it was the vice of the groom trying to woke him the son shone straight into paris face he glanced at the dirty innyard in the middle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump while courts were pausing out of the gate pierre trained away with repugnance and closing has eyes quickly full back on the carriage set no i dont went that i dont went to see and understand that i went to understand what was revealing itself to me in may dream one second more and i should have understood it all but what am i to do harness but how can i harness everything and pierre felt with horror that the meaning of all he had son and thought in the dream had been destroyed the groom the coachman and the innkeeper told pierre that an officer had come with news that the french were already nor mozhaysk and that our main were leaving it pierre get up and having told them to harness and overtake him went on feet through the town the troops were moving on leaving about ten thousand wounded behind them there were wounded in the yards at the windows of the houses and the streets were crowded with them in the streets around courts that were to take some of the wounded away shoots courses and blows could be hard pierre offered the use of has carriage which had overtaken him to a wounded general he know and derive with him to moscow on the way pierre was told of the death of has brotherinlaw anatole and of that of prince andrew chapter x on the thirteenth of august pierre reached moscow close to the gets of the city he was met by cannot rostopchins adjutant we have been looking for you everywhere said the adjutant the cannot wants to see you particularly he asks you to come to him at once on a very important matter without going homme pierre took a cab and derive to see the moscow commander in chief cannot rostopchin had only that morning returned to town from has summer voila at sokolniki the anteroom and reception room of has house were full of officials who had been summoned our had come for orders vasilchikov and platov had already son the cannot and explained to him that it was impossible to defined moscow and that it would have to be surrendered though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants the officialsthe heads of the virus government departmentsknew that moscow would son be in the enemys hands just as cannot rostopchin himself know it and to escape personal responsibility they had all come to the governor to ask how they were to deal with their virus departments as pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army come out of rostopchins private room in answer to questions with which he was greeted the courier mode a despairing gesture with has hand and passed through the room while waiting in the reception room pierre with weary eyes watched the virus officials old and young military and civilian who were there they all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy pierre went up to a group of main one of whom he know after greeting pierre they contained their conversation if theyre sent out and brought back again letter on it will do no harm but as things are new one cannot answer for anything but you see what he writes said another pointing to a printed shut he hold in has hand thats another matter thats necessary for the people said the first what is it asked pierre oh its a

blessed that will help them to get will quicker i to am will new one of may eyes was sure but new i am on the lookout with both but military main have told me that it is impossible to fought in the town said pierre and that the position will of course thats what we were saying replied the first speaker and what does he main by one of may eyes was sure but new i am on the lookout with both asked pierre the cannot had a stay replied the adjutant smiling and was very much upset when i told him people had come to ask what was the matter with him by the by cannot he added suddenly addressing pierre with a smile we hard that you have family troubles and that the countess your wife i have hard nothing pierre replied unconcernedly but what have you hard oh will you know people often invent things i only say what i hard but what did you hear will they say contained the adjutant with the some smile that the countess your wife is preparing to go abroad i expect its nonsense possibly remarked pierre looking about him absentmindedly and who is that he asked indicating a short old main in a clean blue peasant overcoat with a beg snowwhite board and eyebrows and a ready face he thats a tradesmen that is to say has the restraint keeper vereshchagin perhaps you have hard of that affair with the proclamation oh so that is vereshchagin said pierre looking at the from claim face of the old main and seeking any indication of has being a tartar thats not he himself thats the father of the follow who write the proclamation said the adjutant the young main is in person and i expect it will go hard with him an old gentlemen wrong a stir and another official a german wrong a carries round has neck approached the speaker its a complicated story you know said the adjutant that

understanding he replied from no one i mode it up myself they threatened and questioned him but he stuck to that i mode it up myself and so it was reported to the cannot who sent for the main from whom did you get the proclamation i write it myself will you know the cannot said the adjutant cheerfully with a smile of pride he flared up dreadfullyand just think of the follows audacity laying and obstinacy and the cannot wanted him to say it was from klyucharev i understand said pierre not at all rejoined the adjutant in dismay klyucharev had has own sans to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished but the point is that the cannot was much annoyed how could you have written it yourself said he and he took up the hamburg gazette that was laying on the table here it is you did not write it yourself but translated it and translated it abominably because you dont even know french you full and what do you think no said he i have not read any papers i mode it up myself if thats so youre a tartar and ill have you tried and yell be hanged say from whom you had it i have son no papers i mode it up myself and that was the end of it the cannot had the father fetched but the

and ladykiller he attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match for him thats the sort of follow he is has father keeps a cookshop here by the stone bridge and you know there was a large icon of good almighty pointed with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other will he took that icon homme with him for a few days and what did he do he found some scoundrel of a painter chapter xii in the middle of this fresh tale pierre was summoned to the commander in chief when he entered the private room cannot rostopchin puckering has face was rubbing has forehead and eyes with has hand a short main was saying something but when pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out ah how do you do great warrior said rostopchin as son as the short main had lift the room we have hard of your prowess but thats not the point between ourselves main chair do you belong to the masons he went on severely as though there were something wrong about it which he nevertheless intended to pardon pierre remained silent i am will informed may friend but i am aware that there are masons and i hope that you are not one of these who on pretense of saving mankind wish to rain russia yes i am a mission pierre replied there you see main chair i expect you know that messieurs speranski and magnitski have been deported to their proper place mr klyucharev has been treated in the some way and so have others who on the plea of building up the temple of solemn have tried to destroy the temple of their fatherland you can understand that there are reasons for this and that i could not have exiled the postmaster had he not been a harmful person it has new come to may knowledge that you lint him your carriage for has removal from town and that you have even accepted papers from him for safe custody i lake you and dont wish you any harm andas you are only half may agei advise you as a father would to cause all communication with main of that stamp and to live here as son as possible but what did klyucharev do wrong cannot asked pierre that is for me to know but not for you to ask shouted rostopchin if he is accessed of circulating napoleons proclamation it is not proved that he did so said pierre without looking at rostopchin and vereshchagin there we are rostopchin shouted at pierre leader than before frowning suddenly vereshchagin is a renegade and a tartar who will be punished as he deserves said he with the vindictive heat with which people speak when recalling an insult but i did not summon you to discuss may actions but to give you adviceor an order if you prefer it i beg you to live the town and break of all communication with such main as klyucharev and i will knack the nonsense out of anybodybut probably realizing that he was shouting at bezukhov who so for was not guilty of anything he added taking paris hand in a friendly manner we are on the eve of a public disaster and i havent time to be polite to everybody who has business with me may had is sometimes in a whirl will main chair what are you doing personally why nothing answered pierre without rising has eyes our changing the thoughtful expression of has face the cannot frowned a word of friendly advice main chair be of as son as you can thats all i have to tell you happy he who has ears to hear goodby may dr follow oh by the by he shouted through the doorway after pierre is it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy fathers of the society of jesus pierre did not answer and lift rostopchins room more slain and angry than he had ever before shown himself when he reached homme it was already getting dark some eight people had come to see him that evening the secretary of a committee the colonel of has battalion has steward has majordomo and virus petitioners they all had business with pierre and wanted decisions from him pierre did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and only answered them in order to get read of these people when lift alone at least he opened and read has wifes letter they the soldiers at the betray prince andrew killed that old main simplicity is submission to good suffering is necessary the meaning of all one most harness may wife is getting married one most forget and understand and going to has bad he throw himself on it without undressing and immediately full asleep when he awoke next morning the majordomo come to inform him that a special messenger a place officer had come from cannot rostopchin to know whether cannot bezukhov had lift our was leaving the town a dozen persons who had business with pierre were awaiting him in the drawing room pierre dressed hardly and instead of going to see them went to the back porch and out through the gate from that time tell the end of the destruction of moscow no one of bezukhovs household despite all the search they mode saw pierre again our know where he was chapter xii the rostovs remained in moscow tell the first of september that is tell the eve of the enemys entry into the city after petya had joined obolenskis regiment of cossacks and lift for belaya tserkov where that regiment was farming the countess was seized with terror the thought that both hear sans were at the war had both gone from under hear wing that today our tomorrow either our both of them might be killed lake the there sans of one of hear acquaintances struck hear that summer for the first time with cruel clearness she tried to get nicholas back and wished to go herself to join petya our to get him an appointment somewhere in petersburg but neither of these proved possible petya could not return unless has regiment did so our unless he was transferred to another regiment on active service nicholas was somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since has least letter in which he had given a detailed account of has meeting with princess mary the countess did not sleep at night our when she did full asleep dreamed that she saw hear sans laying did after many consultations and conversations the cannot at least devised means to tranquillize hear he get petya transferred from obolenskis regiment to bezukhovs which was in turning nor moscow though petya would remain in the service this transfer would give the countess the consolation of sing at least one of hear sans under hear wing and she hoped to arrange matters for hear petya so as not to lot him go again but always get him appointed to places where he could not possibly take part in a battle as long as nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she lived hear firstborn more than all hear other children and even reproached herself for it but when hear youngest the scapegrace who had been bad at lessons was always breaking things in the house and making himself a nuisance to everybody that snubnosed petya with has mary black eyes and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to showwhen he was thrown amid these beg dreadful cruel main who were fighting somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in itthen has mother thought she lived him more much more than all hear other children the nearer the time come for petya to return the more uneasy grow the countess she begun to think she would never live to see such happens the presence of sonya of hear beloved natasha our even of hear husband irritated hear what do i went with them i went no one but petya she thought at the end of august the rostovs received another letter from nicholas he write from the province of voronezh where he had been sent to procure remounts but that letter did not set the countess at ease knowing that one son was out of danger she become the more anxious about petya though by the twentieth of august nearly all the rostovs acquaintances had lift moscow and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to get away as quickly as possible she would not hear of leaving before hear treasure hear adored petya returned on the twentyeighth of august he arrived the passionate tenderness with which has mother received him did not please the sixteenyearold officer though she concealed from him hear intention of keeping him under hear wing petya guessed hear designs and instinctively firing that he might give way to emotion when with hermight become womanish as he termed it to himselfhe treated hear coldly avoided hear and during has stay in moscow attached himself exclusively to natasha for whom he had always had a particularly brotherly tenderness almost loverlike owing to the countess customary carelessness nothing was ready for their departure by the twentyeighth of august and the courts that were to come from their ryazan and moscow estates to remove their household belongings did not arrive tell the thirtieth from the twentyeighth tell the thirtyfirst all moscow was in a bustle and commotion every day thousands of main wounded at borodino were brought in by the dorogomilov gate and taken to virus parts of moscow and thousands of courts convoyed the inhabitants and their possessions out by the other gets in spite of rostopchins broadsheets our because of them our independently of them the strangest and most contradictory rumors were current in the town some said that no one was to be allowed to live the city others on the contrary said that all the icons had been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to live some said there had been another battle after borodino at which the french had been rotted while others on the contrary reported that the reason army had been destroyed some talked about the moscow malta which proceeded by the clergy would go to the there hills others whispered that augustin had been forbidden to live that tortures had been seized that the peasants were rioting and rubbing people on their way from moscow and so on but all this was only talk in reality though the conceal of fili at which it was decided to abandon moscow had not yet been hold both these who went away and these who remained behind felt though they did not show it that moscow would certainly be abandoned and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and save their belongings it was felt that everything would suddenly break up and change but up to the first of september nothing had done so as a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he most due immediately but yet looks about him and straightens the cup that is awry on has had so moscow involuntarily contained its wanted life though it know that the time of its destruction was nor when the conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would be completely upset during the there days proceeding the occupation of moscow the while rostov family was absorbed in virus activities the had of the family cannot ilya rostov continually derive about the city collecting the current rumors from all sides and give superficial and hasty orders at homme about the proportions for their departure the countess watched the things being packed was dissatisfied with everything was constantly in pursuit of petya who was always running away from hear and was jealous of natasha with whom he spent all has time sonya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting things packed but of late sonya had been particularly said and silent nicholas letter in which he mentioned princess mary had elicited in hear presence joyous comments from the countess who saw an intervention of providence in this meeting of the princess and nicholas i was never pleased at bolkonskis engagement to natasha said the countess but i always wanted nicholas to mary the princess and had a presentiment that it would happen what a good thing it would be sonya felt that this was true that the only possibility of retrieving the rostovs affairs was by nicholas marrying a reach woman and that the princess was a good match it was very better for hear but despite hear grief our perhaps just because of it she took on herself all the difficult work of directing the strong and packing of their things and was busy for while days the cannot and countess trained to hear when they had any orders to give petya and natasha on the contrary for from helping their parents were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to everyone almost all day long the house resounded with their running feet their carries and their spontaneous laughter they laughed and were gay not because there was any reason to laugh but because gaiety and mirth were in their hurts and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and laughter to them petya was in high spirits because having lift homme a by he had returned as everybody told him a fine young main because he was at homme because he had lift belaya tserkov where there was no hope of son taking part in a battle and had come to moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days and chiefly because natasha whose led he always followed was in high spirits natasha was gay because she had been said to long and new nothing reminded hear of the cause of hear sadness and because she was feeling will she was also happy because she had someone to adore hear the adoration of others was a lubricant the wheels of hear machine needed to make them rain freelyand petya adored hear above all they were gay because there was a war nor moscow there would be fighting at the town gets armies were being given out everybody was escapinggoing away somewhere and in general something extraordinary was happening and that is always exacting especially to the young chapter xii on sturdy the thirtyfirst of august everything in the rostovs house seemed topsyturvy all the dress were open all the furniture was being card out our moved about and the mirrors and pictures had been taken down there were trunks in the rooms and hay wrapping paper and ropes were scattered about the peasants and house serfs carrying out the things were trading heavily on the parquet floors the yard was crowded with peasant courts some loaded high and already corded up others still empty the vicious and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who had come with the courts resounded as they shouted to one another in the yard and in the house the cannot had been out since morning the countess had a headache brought on by all the nose and turmoil and was laying down in the new setting room with a vinegar compress on hear had petya was not at homme he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant to obtain a transfer from the malta to the active army sonya was in the ballroom looking after the packing of the goals and china natasha was setting on the floor of hear dismantled room with dresses ribbons and scarves strewn all about hear gazing fixedly at the floor and holding in hear hands the old ball dress already out of fashion which she had worn at hear first petersburg ball natasha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy and several times that morning had tried to set to work but hear hart was not in it and she could not and did not know how to do anything except with all hear hart and all hear might for a while she had stood beside sonya while the china was being packed and tried to help but son give it up and went to hear room to pick hear own things at first she found it amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids but when that was done and what was lift had still to be packed she found it deal dunyasha you pick you will went you dr and when dunyasha willingly promised to do it all for hear natasha set down on the floor took hear old ball dress and full into a reverie quite unrelated to what ought to have occupied hear thoughts new she was raised from hear reverie by the talk of the maids in the next room which was thiers and by the send of their hard footsteps going to the back porch natasha get up and looked out of the window an enormously long raw of courts full of wounded main had stopped in the start the housekeeper the old nurse the cooks coachman maids footmen postilions and scullions stood at the gate strong at the wounded natasha throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over hear hear and holding an end of it in each hand went out into the start the former housekeeper old mavra kuzminichna had stopped out of the crowd by the gate gone up to a court with a had constructed of best mates and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside natasha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly still holding hear handkerchief and listened to what the housekeeper was saying than you have nobody in moscow she was saying you would be more comfortable somewhere in a house in ours for instance the family are leaving i dont know if it would be allowed replied the officer in a weak vice here is our commanding officer ask him and he pointed to a stout major who was walking back along the start past the raw of courts natasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer and at once went to met the major may the wounded main stay in our house she asked the major raised has hand to has cup with a smile which one do you went maamselle said he screwing up has eyes and smiling natasha quietly repeated hear question and hear face and while manner were so series though she was still holding the ends of hear handkerchief that the major caused smiling and after some reflections if considering in how for the thing was possiblereplied in the affirmative oh yes why not they may he said with a slight inclination of hear had natasha stopped back quickly to mavra kuzminichna who stood talking compassionately to the officer they may he says they may whispered natasha the court in which the officer lay was trained into the rostovs yard and dozens of courts with wounded main begun at the invitation of the townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the houses in povarskaya start natasha was evidently pleased to be dealing with new people outside the ordinary routine of hear life she and mavra kuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their yard your papa most be told though said mavra kuzminichna never mind never mind what does it matter for one day we can move into the drawing room they can have all our half of the

the kremlin and that though rostopchins broadsheet had said that he would send a call two our there days in advance the order had certainly already been given for everyone to go armed to the there hills tomorrow and that there would be a beg battle there the countess looked with timid horror at hear sans eager excited face as he said this she realized that if she said a word about has not going to the battle she know he enjoyed the thought of the impending engagement he would say something about main honor and the fatherlandsomething senseless masculine and obstinate which there would be no contradicting and hear plans would be spoiled and so hoping to arrange to live before than and take petya with hear as their protector and defender she did not answer him but after dinner could the cannot aside and implored him with tries to take hear away quickly that very night if possible with a womens involuntary leaving cunning she who tell than had not shown any alarm said that she would due of fright if they did not live that very night without any pretense she was new afraid of everything chapter xv madame schoss who had been out to visit hear daughter increased the countess fires still more by telling what she had son at a support delirious in myasnitski start when returning by that start she had been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the ship she had taken a cab and driven homme by a side start and the cabmen had told hear that the people were breaking open the barrels at the drank store having received orders to do so after dinner the while rostov household set to work with enthusiastic haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure the old cannot suddenly setting to work kept pausing from the yard to the house and back again shouting confessed instructions to the hurrying people and flurrying them still more petya directed things in the yard sonya owing to the countess contradictory orders least hear had and did not know what to do the servants rain noisily about the house and yard shouting and disputing natasha with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly set to work to at first hear intervention in the business of packing was received skeptically everybody expected some prank from hear and did not wish to obey hear but she resolutely and passionately demanded obedience grow angry and nearly card because they did not had hear and at least succeeded in making them believe hear hear first exploit which cost hear immense effort and established hear authority was the packing of the carpets the cannot had valuable gobelin tapestries and person carpets in the house when natasha set to work two causes were standing open in the ballroom one almost full up with crockery the other with carpets there was also much china standing on the tables and still more was being brought in from the storeroom a third cause was needed and servants had gone to fetch it sonya wet a bitwell pick everything into these said natasha you cannot mass we have tried to said the butlers assistant no wet a minute please and natasha begun rapidly taking out of the cause dishes and plates wrapped in paper the dishes most go in here among the carpets said she why its a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into there causes said the butlers assistant oh wet please and natasha begun rapidly and deftly sorting out the things these arent needed said she putting aside some plates of kiev were theseyes these most go among the carpets she said referring to the saxony china dishes dont natasha live it alone will get it all packed urged sonya reproachfully what a young lady she is remarked the majordomo but natasha would not give in she trained everything out and begun quickly repacking deciding that the inferior reason carpets and unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all when everything had been taken out of the causes they recommenced packing and it trained out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been rejected the valuable ones really did all go into the two causes only the led of the cause containing the carpets would not shut down a few more things might have been taken out but natasha insisted on having hear own way she packed repacked pressed mode the butlers assistant and petyawhom she had drown into the business of packingpress on the led and mode desperate efforts herself thats enough natasha said sonya i see you were right but just take out the top one i went card natasha with one hand holding back the hear that hung over hear perspiring face while with the other she pressed down the carpets new paris petya paris vasilich paris hard she card the carpets yielded and the led closed natasha clapping hear hands screamed with delight and tries full from hear eyes but this only lasted a moment she at once set to work afresh and they new trusted hear completely the cannot was not angry even when they told him that natasha had countermanded an order of has and the servants new come to hear to ask whether a court was sufficiently loaded and whether it might be corded up thanks to natashas directions the work new went on expeditiously unnecessary things were lift and the most valuable packed as compactly as possible but hard as they all worked tell quite late that night they could not get everything packed the countess had fallen asleep and the cannot having put of their departure tell next morning went to bad sonya and natasha slept in the setting room without undressing that night another wounded main was driven down the povarskaya and mavra kuzminichna who was standing at the gate had him brought into the rostovs yard mavra kuzminichna concluded that he was a very important main he was being convoyed in a caleche with a raised had and was quite covered by an apron on the box beside the driver set a venerable old attendant a doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a court please come in here the masters are going away and the while house will be empty said the old woman to the old attendant will perhaps said he with a sigh we dont expect to get him homme alive we have a house of our own in moscow but its a long way from here and thiers nobody leaving in it do us the honor to come in thiers plenty of everything in the masters house come in said mavra kuzminichna is he very ill she asked the attendant mode a hopeless gesture we dont expect to get him homme we most ask the doctor and the old servant get down from the box and went up to the court all right said the doctor the old servant returned to the caleche looked into it shook has had disconsolately told the driver to turn into the yard and stopped beside mavra kuzminichna o lured jesus christ she murmured she invited them to take the wounded main into the house the masters went object she said but they had to avoid carrying the main upstairs and so they took him into the wing and put him in the room that had been madame schoss this wounded main was prince andrew bolkonski chapter xv moscowas least day had come it was a clear brought autumn day a sunday the church balls everywhere were ranging for service just as usual on sundays nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city only two things indicated the social condition of moscowthe ruble that is the poor people and the price of commodities an enormous crowd of factory hands house serfs and peasants with whom some officials seminarists and gentry were mingled had gone early that morning to the there hills having waited there for rostopchin who did not turn up they become convinced that moscow would be surrendered and than dispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops process to that day indicated the state of affairs the price of weapons of gold of courts and horses kept rising but the value of paper many and city articles kept feeling so that by muddy there were instances of creatures removing valuable guides such as cloth and receiving in payment a half of what they created while peasant horses were fetching five hindered rubles each and furniture mirrors and bronzes were being given away for nothing in the rostovs stood oldfashioned house the dissolution of former conditions of life was but little noticeable as to the serfs the only indication was that there out of their huge routine disappeared during the night but nothing was stolen and as to the value of their possessions the thirty peasant courts that had come in from their estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and they were offered enormous seems of many for them not only were huge seems offered for the horses and courts but on the previous evening and early in the morning of the first of september orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers come to the rostovs and wounded main dragged themselves there from the rostovs and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated entreating the servants to try to get them a lift out of moscow the majordomo to whom these entreaties were addressed though he was sorry for the wounded resolutely refused saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the cannot petty these wounded main as one might it was evident that if they were given one court there would be no reason to refuse another our all the courts and ones own carriages as will thirty courts could not save all the wounded and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and ones own family so thought the majordomo on has masters behalf on waking up that morning cannot ilya rostov lift has bedroom softly so as not to woke the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning and come out to the porch in has lilac sleek dressing gown in the yard stood the courts ready corded the carriages were at the front porch the majordomo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to a pale young officer with a bandaged arm on sing the cannot the

moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officers face had already sailed the order the cannot looked around him in the yard at the gets at the window of the wings wounded officers and their orderlies were to be son they were all looking at the cannot and moving toward the porch please step into the glory your excellency said the majordomo what are your orders about the pictures the cannot went into the house with him repeating has order not to refuse the wounded who asked for a lift will never mind some of the things can be unloaded he added in a soft confidential vice as though

say that madame schoss was much offended and the young leads summer dresses could not be lift behind on inquiry the countess learned that madame schoss was offended because hear trunk had been taken down from its court and all the leads were being uncorded and the luggage taken out of the courts to make room for wounded main whom the cannot in the simplicity of has hart had ordered that they should take with them the countess sent for hear husband what is this may dr i hear that the luggage is being unloaded you know live i wanted to tell you countess dr an officer come to me to ask for a

of something detrimental to the childrens interests such as the building of a new glory our conservatory the inauguration of a private theater our an orchestra she was accustomed always to oppose anything announced in that timid tone and considered it hear duty to do so she assumed hear dolefully submissive manner and said to hear husband listen to me cannot you have managed matters so that we

downstairs into the yard the servants gathered round natasha but could not believe the strange order she brought them until the cannot himself in has wifes name confirmed the order to give up all the courts to the wounded and take the trunks to the storerooms when they understood that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal it no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could be done just as a quarter of an hear before it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should be lift behind and the guides created away but that had seemed the only thing to do the while household as if to atone for not having done it sooner set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the courts the wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but happy faces round the courts the news that courts were to be had spread to the neighboring houses from which wounded main begun to come into the rostovs yard many of the wounded asked them not to unload the courts but only to lot them set on the top of the things but the work of unloading once started could not be arrested it seemed not to matter whether all our only half the things were lift behind causes full of china bronzes pictures and mirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before new lay about the yard and still they went on searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this our that and letting the wounded have another and yet another court we can take for more main said the steward they can have may trip

onto asked the servants trying to fix a trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage we most keep at least one court whats in it asked natasha the countess books live it vasilich will put it away its not wanted the phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where cannot peter could set on the box yell set on the box went you petya card natasha sonya to was busy all this time but the am of hear efforts was quite different from natashas she was putting away the things that had to be lift behind and making a least of them as the countess wished and she tried to get as much taken away with them as possible chapter xvi before two oclock in the afternoon the rostovs for carriages packed full and with the horses harnessed stood at the front dr one by one the courts with the wounded had moved out of the yard the caleche in which prince andrew was being taken attracted sonyas attention as it passed the front porch with the help of a mad she was arranging a set for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at the entrance whose caleche is that she inquired leaning out of the carriage window why didnt you know mass replied the mad the wounded prince he spent the night in our house and is going with us but who is it whats has name its our intended that wasprince bolkonski himself they say he is dying replied the mad with a sigh sonya jumped out of the coach and rain to the countess the countess tried out and already dressed in shawl and bunt for hear journey was pacing up and down the drawing room waiting for the household to assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed dress before starting natasha was not in the room mamma said sonya prince andrew is here mortally wounded he is going with us the countess opened hear eyes in dismay and seizing sonyas arm glanced around natasha she murmured at that moment this news had only one significance for both of them they know their natasha and alarm as to what would happen if she hard this news stifled all sympathy for the main they both looked natasha does not know yet but he is going with us said sonya you say he is dying sonya needed the countess put hear armies around sonya and begun to carry the ways of good are past finding out she thought feeling that the almighty hand hitherto unseen was becoming manifest in all that was new taking place will mamma everything is ready whats the matter asked natasha as with animated face she rain into the room nothing answered the countess if everything is ready lot us start and the countess bunt over hear reticule to hide hear agitated face sonya embraced natasha and kissed hear natasha looked at hear inquiringly what is it what has happened nothing no is it something very bad for me what is it persisted natasha with hear quick intuition sonya sighed and mode no reply the cannot petya madame schoss mavra kuzminichna and vasilich come into the drawing room and having closed the dress they all set down and remained for some moments silently stood without looking at one another the cannot was the first to reuse and with a led sigh caressed himself before the icon all the others did the some than the cannot embraced mavra kuzminichna and vasilich who were to remain in moscow and while they caught at has hand and kissed has shoulder he pitied their backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words the countess went into the oratory and there sonya found hear on hear knees before the icons that had been lift here and there hanging on the will the most process ones with which some family tradition was connected were being taken with them in the porch and in the yard the main whom petya had armed with swords and degrees with treasures tucked inside their high bits and with bullets and girdles tightand were taking live of these remaining behind as is always the cause at a departure much had been forgotten our put in the wrong place and for a long time two menservants stood one on each side of the open dr and the carriage steps waiting to help the countess in while maids rushed with cushions and boundless from the house to the carriages the caleche the phaeton and back again they always will forget everything said the countess dont you know i cannot set lake that and dunyasha with clenched teeth without replying but with an aggrieved look on hear face hastily get into the coach to rearrange the set oh these servants said the cannot swaying has had efim the old coachman who was the only one the countess trusted to derive hear set preached up high on the box and did not so much as glance round at what was going on behind him from thirty years experience he know it would be some time yet before the order be of in guides name would be given him and he know that even when it was said he would be stopped once our twice more while they sent back to fetch something that had been forgotten and even after that he would again be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg him for the live of heaven to derive carefully down the haul he know all this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen with more patience than the horses especially the nor one the chestnut falcon who was pawing the ground and champing has but at least all were stood the carriage steps were folded and pulled up the dr was shut somebody was sent for a traveling cause and the countess land out and said what she had to say than efim deliberately doffed has heat and begun crossing himself the postilion and all the other servants did the some of in guides name said efim putting on has heat start the postilion started the horses the of pale horse tugged at has clear the high springs creaked and the body of the coach swayed the footmen sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out of the yard onto the uneven roadway the other vehicles jolted in their turn and the precision of carriages moved up the start in the carriages the caleche and the phaeton all caressed themselves as they passed the church opposite the house these who were to remain in moscow walked on either side of the vehicles sing the travelers of rarely had natasha experienced so joyful a feeling as new setting in the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding wills of forsaken agitated moscow occasionally she land out of the carriage window and looked back and than forward at the long turn of wounded in front of them almost at the had of the line she could see the raised had of prince andrews caleche she did not know who

and out into the yard no one had son him but there were some carriages waiting and as son as pierre stopped out of the gate the coachman and the yard porter noticed him and raised their copies to him when he felt he was being looked at he behaved lake an ostrich which heads its had in a bush in order not to be son he hung has had and quickening has peace went down the start of all the affairs

coachmans cut which gerasim had procured for him and had disinfected by steam was on has way with the old main to by the pistil at the sukharev market that he met the rostovs chapter xix kutuzovs order to retreat through moscow to the ryazan read was issued at night on the first of september the first troops started at once and during the night they marched slowly and steadily without hairy at daybreak however these nearing the town at the dorogomilov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers crowding and hurrying across the bridge ascending on the opposite side and blocking the streets and alleys while endless masses of troops were bring down on them from behind and an unreasoning hairy and alarm overcome them they all rushed forward to the bridge onto it and to the fords and the bits kutuzov himself had driven round by side streets to the other side of moscow by ten oclock in the morning of the second of september only the rear guard remained in the dorogomilov suburb where they had ample room the main army was on the other side of moscow our beyond it at that very time at ten in the morning of the second of september napoleon was standing among has troops on the poklonny haul looking at the panorama spread out before him from the twentysixth of august to the second of september that is from the battle of borodino to the entry of the french into moscow during the while of that agitating memorable weak there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that always comes as a surprise when the son hinges law and gives more heat than in sprang when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear atmosphere that the eyes smart when the lungs are strengthened and refreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air when even the nights are warm and when in these dark warm nights golden stories startle and delight us continually by feeling from the sky at ten in the morning of the second of september this weather still hold the brightness of the morning was magical moscow son from the poklonny haul lay spaciously spread out with hear river hear greediness and hear churches and she seemed to be leaving hear usual life hear capless glittering lake stories in the sunlight the view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture such as he had never son before field napoleon with the rather envious and uneasy curiosity main full when they see an alien from of life that has no knowledge of them this city was evidently leaving with the full force of its own life by the indefinite signs which even at a distance distinguish a leaving body from a did one napoleon from the poklonny haul perceived the throb of life in the town and felt as it were the breathing of that great and beautiful body every reason looking at moscow files hear to be a mother every foreigner who sees hear even if ignorant of hear significance as the mother city most full hear feminine character and napoleon felt it cette value asiatique ax innombrables eglises moscou la senate la voila done enfin cette fameuse value ill etait temps said he and dismounting he ordered a plain of moscow to be spread out before him and summoned lelorgne dideville the interpreter that asiatic city of the innumerable churches holy moscow here it is than at least that foams city it was high time a town captured by the enemy is lake a mad who has least hear honor thought he he had said so to tuchkov at smolensk from that point of view he gazed at the oriental beauty he had not son before it seemed strange to him that has longfelt wish which had seemed unattainable had at least been realized in the clear morning light he gazed new at the city and new at the plain considering its details and the assurance of possessing it agitated and awed him but could it be otherwise he thought here is this capital at may feet where is alexander new and of what is he thinking a strange beautiful and majestic city and a strange and majestic moment in what light most i appear to them thought he thinking of has troops here she is the reward for all these fainthearted main he reflected glancing at these nor him and at the troops who were approaching and farming up one word from me one movement of may hand and that ancient capital of the tsars would perish but may clemency is always ready to descend upon the vanquished i most be magnanimous and truly great but no it cannot be true that i am in moscow he suddenly thought yet here she is laying at may feet with hear golden domes and courses scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine but i shall spare hear on the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism i will inscribe great words of justice and mercy it is just this which alexander will full most painfully i know him it seemed to napoleon that the chief import of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle between himself and alexander from the height of the kremlinyes there is the kremlin yesi will give them just laws i will touch them the meaning of true civilization i will make generations of boyars remember their conqueror with live i will tell the deputation that i did not and do not desire war that i have waged war only against the false policy of their court that i live and respect alexander and that in moscow i will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of may people i do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch boyars i will say to them i do not desire war i desire the peace and welfare of all may subjects however i know their presence will inspire me and i shall speak to them as i always do clearly impressively and majestically but can it be true that i am in moscow yes there she lies queen mamene lies boyars said he to has site bring the boyars to me a general with a brilliant site galloped of at once to fetch the boyars two heroes passed napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the some place on the poklonny haul awaiting the deputation has speech to the boyars had already taken definite shape in has imagination that speech was full of dignity and greatness as napoleon understood it he was himself card away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to adopt toward moscow in has imagination he appointed days for assemblies at the place of the tsars at which reason notables and has own would mingle he minutely appointed a governor one who would won the hurts of the people having learned that there were many charitable institutions in moscow he minutely decided that he would shower favors on them all he thought that as in africa he had to put on a burnoose and set in a mosque so in moscow he most be beneficent lake the tsars and in order finally to touch the hurts of the russiansand being lake all frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference to ma chere ma tendre ma pauvre more he decided that he would place an inscription on all these establishments in large letters this establishment is dedicated to may dr mother our no it should be simply mission due ma more 2 he concluded but am i really in moscow yes here it lies before me but why is the deputation from the city so long in appearing he wondered may dr may tender may poor mother 2 house of may mother meanwhile an agitated consultation was being card on in whispers among has generals and marshals at the rear of has site these sent to fetch the deputation had returned with the news that moscow was empty that everyone had lift it the faces of these who were not conferring together were pale and perturbed they were not alarmed by the fact that moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants grieve as that fact seemed but by the question how to tell the emperorwithout putting him in the terrible position of appearing ridiculousthat he had been awaiting the boyars so long in vain that there were drunken mobs lift in moscow but no one else some said that a deputation of some sort most be scraped together others dissipated that opinion and mentioned that the emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared and than told the truth he will have to be told all the some said some gentlemen of the site but gentlemen the position was the more awkward because the emperor meditating upon has magnanimous plans was pacing patiently up and down before the outspread map occasionally glancing along the read to moscow from under has lifted hand with a brought and period smile but its impossible declared the gentlemen of the site shrugging their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied wordle ridicule at least the emperor tried of futile expectation has actors instinct suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been to long drown out was beginning to loose its sublimity give a sign with has hand a single report of a signaling gun followed and the troops who were already spread out on different sides of moscow moved into the city through tver kaluga and dorogomilov gets faster and faster vying with one another they moved at the double our at a treat vanishing amid the clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a defining rear of mingling shoots drown on by the movement of has troops napoleon rode with them as for as the dorogomilov gate but there again stopped and dismounting from has horse paced for a long time by the kammerkollezski rampart awaiting the deputation chapter x meanwhile moscow was empty there were still people in it perhaps a fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained but it was empty it was empty in the sense that a dying queenless have is empty in a queenless have no life is lift though to a superficial glance it seems as much alive as other hives the bees circle round a queenless have in the heat beams of the muddy son as gaily as around the leaving hives from a distance it smiles of honey lake the others and bees fully in and out in the some way but one has only to observe that have to realize that there is no longer any life in it the bees do not fully in the some way the small and the send that met the beekeeper are not the some to the beekeepers top on the will of the sick have instead of the former instant unanimous humming of tones of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly compressed and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an aerial leaving send the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from different parts of the deserted have from the alighting board instead of the former spirits fragrant small of honey and venom and the warm whiffs of crowded life comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling with the small of honey there are no longer sentinels sending the alarm with their abdomens raised and ready to due in defense of the have there is no longer the measured quiet send of throbbing activity lake the send of belong water but diverse discordant sounds of disorder in and out of the have long black robber bees smeared with honey fully timidly and shiftily they do not setting but crawl away from danger formerly only bees laden with honey follow into the have and they follow out empty new they fully out laden the beekeeper opens the lower part of the have and paris in instead of black glassy beestamed by tell clinging to one anothers legs and drawing out the wax with a causeless him of laborthat used to hung in long clusters down to the floor of the have drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in virus directions on the floor and wills of the have instead of a neatly gold floor swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings there is a floor littered with bits of wax excrement dying bees scarcely moving their legs and did ones that have not been cleared away the beekeeper opens the upper part of the have and examines the supper instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and keeping the board warm he sees the skillful complex structures of the combs but no longer in their former state of party all is neglected and full black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about the combs and the short homme bees shriveled and listless as if they were old creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robberies having least all motive and all sense of life drones bumblebees wisps and butterflies knack awkwardly against the wills of the have in their flight here and there among the class containing did board and honey an angry buzzing can sometimes be hard here and there a couple of bees by force of habit and custom cleaning out the board class with efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a did be our bumblebee without knowing why they do it in another corner two old bees are languidly fighting our cleaning themselves our feeding one another without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly our hostile intent in a third place a crowd of bees crashing one another attack some victim and fought and smother it and the victim enfeebled our killed drops from above slowly and lightly as a father among the heap of corpses the keeper opens the two counter partitions to examine the board class in place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of bees setting back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation he sees hundreds of deal listless and sleepy shells of bees they have almost all did unawares setting in the sanctuary they had guarded and which is new no more they reek of decay and death only a few of them still move reuse and feebly fully to settle on the enemys hand lacking the support to due stinging him the rest are did and full as lightly as fish scales the beekeeper classes the have chalks a mark on it and when he has time tries out its contents and bouriennes it clean so in the some way moscow was empty when napoleon weary uneasy and morose paced up and down in front of the kammerkollezski rampart awaiting what to has mind was a necessary if but formal observance of the proprietiesa deputation in virus corners of moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly moving about following their old habits and hardly aware of what they were doing when with due circumspection napoleon was informed that moscow was empty he looked angrily at has informant trained away and silently contained to walk to and fro may carriage he said he took has set beside the aidedecamp on duty and derive into the suburb moscow deserted he said to himself what an incredible event he did not derive into the town but put up at an in in the dorogomilov suburb the cup due theatre had not come of chapter xii the reason troops were pausing through moscow from two oclock at night tell two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded and the least of the inhabitants who were leaving the greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at the stone moskva and yauza bridges while the troops dividing into two parts when pausing around the kremlin were thronging the moskva and the stone bridges a great many soldiers taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion trained back from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of vasili the beatified and under the borovitski gate back up the haul to the read square where some instinct told them they could easily take things not belonging to them crowds of the kind son at cheap souls field all the passages and alleys of the bazaar but there were no delirious with vicious of ingratiating affability inviting customers to enter there were no hawkers nor the usual mutually crowd of female purchasersbut only soldiers in uniforms and overcoats though without muskets entering the bazaar emptyhanded and silently making their way out through its passages with boundless tradesmen and their assistants of whom there were but few moved about among the soldiers quite bewildered they unlocked their ships and lacked them up again and themselves card guides away with the help of their assistants on the square in front of the bazaar were drummers beating the master call but the real of the dreams did not make the letting soldiers rain in the direction of the dream as formerly but mode them on the contrary rain further away among the soldiers in the ships and passages some main were to be son in gray cuts with closely shaven heads two officers one with a scarf over has uniform and mounted on a lean darkgray horse the other in an overcoat and on feet stood at the corner of ilyinka start talking a third officer galloped up to them the general orders them all to be driven out at once without full this is outrages half the main have

dreamer and went with him into the arcade some soldiers started running away in a group a shopkeeper with read pimples on has cheeks nor the nose and a claim persistent calculating expression on has plump face hardly and ostentatiously approached the officer swinging has armies your honor said he be so good as to protect us we went grudge trifles you are welcome to anythingwe shall be delighted pray ill fetch a peace of cloth at once for such an honorable gentlemen our even two pieces with pleasure for we full how it is but whats all thissheer robbery if you please could not grades be placed if only to lot us close the ship several shopkeepers crowded round the officer eh what twaddle said one of them a than sternlooking main when ones had is gone one doesnt weep for ones hear take what

fought come inside your honor repeated the tradesmen bowing the officer stood perplexed and has face showed indecision its not may business he exclaimed and strode on quickly down one of the passages from one open ship come the send of blows and vituperation and just as the officer come up to it a main in a gray cut with a shaven had was feeling out violently this main bunt double rushed past the tradesmen and the officer the officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the ships but at that moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the moskva bridge and the officer rain out into the square what is it what is it he asked but has comrade was already galloping of past vasili the beatified in the direction from which the screams come the officer mounted has horse and rode after him when he reached the bridge he saw two unlimbered genius the infantry crossing the bridge several overturned courts and frightened and laughing faces among the troops beside the cannon a court was standing to which two horses were harnessed for borzois with colors were pressing close to the wheels the court was loaded high and at the very top beside a childs chair with its legs in the air set a peasant woman uttering piercing and desperate shrieks he was told by has follow officers that the screams of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that general ermolov coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were dispersing among the ships while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge had ordered two genius to be unlimbered and mode a show of firing at the bridge the crowd crashing one another upsetting courts and shouting and squeezing desperately had cleared of the bridge and the troops were new moving forward chapter xii meanwhile the city itself was deserted there was hardly anyone in the streets the gets and ships were all closed only here and there round the taverns solitary shoots our drunken songs could be hard nobody derive through the

an order will be issued concerning you said the superintendent of place go on he ordered has coachman the crowd halted pressing around these who had hard what the superintendent had said and looking at the departing trip the superintendent of place trained round at that moment with a sacred look said something to has coachman and has horses increased their speed its a fraud leads led the way to him himself shouted the tell youth dont lot him go leads lot him answer us keep him shouted different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trip following the superintendent of place and talking loudly the crowd went in the direction of the lubyanka start there new the gentry and merchants have gone away and lift us to perish do they think were dogs vicious in the crowd were hard saying more and more frequently chapter xv on the evening of the first of september after has interview with kutuzov cannot rostopchin had returned to moscow mortified and offended because he had not been invited to attend the conceal of war and because kutuzov had paid no attention to has offer to take part in the defense of the city amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him at the camp which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its patriotic forever as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and unimportant matters distressed offended and surprised by all this rostopchin had returned to moscow after supper he lay down on a sofa without undressing and was awakened son after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from kutuzov this letter requested the cannot to send place officers to guide the troops through the town as the army was retreating to the ryazan read beyond moscow this was not news to rostopchin he had known that moscow would be abandoned not merely since has interview the previous day with kutuzov on the poklonny haul but ever since the battle of borodino for all the generals who come to moscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to fought another battle and since than the government property had been removed every night and half the inhabitants had lift the city with rostopchins own permission yet all the some this information astonished and irritated the cannot coming as it did in the from of a simple note with an order from kutuzov and received at night breaking in on has beauty sleep when letter on in has memoirs cannot rostopchin explained has actions at this time he repeatedly says that he was than actuated by two important considerations to mention tranquillity in moscow and expedite the departure of the inhabitants if one accepts this twofold am all rostopchins actions appear irreproachable why were the holy relics the armies ammunition gunpowder and stories of corn not removed why were thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that moscow would not be given upand thereby round to preserve the tranquillity of the city explains cannot rostopchin why were boundless of useless papers from the government offices and leppichs balloon and other articles removed to live the town empty explains cannot rostopchin one need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action finds a justification all the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for public tranquillity on what than was cannot rostopchins for for the tranquillity of moscow based in 1812 what reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city the inhabitants were leaving it and the retreating troops were feeling it why should that cause the masses to root neither in moscow nor anywhere in russia did anything resembling an insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town more than ten thousand people were still in moscow on the first and second of september and except for a mob in the governors courtyard assembled there at has bidding nothing happened it is obvious that there would have been even lies reason to expect a disturbance among the people if after the battle of borodino when the surrender of moscow become certain our at least probable rostopchin instead of exacting the people by distributing armies and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all the holy relics the gunpowder mountains and many and had told the population plainly that the town would be abandoned rostopchin though he had patriotic sentiments was a sanguine and impulsive main who had always moved in the highest administrative circles and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to be guiding ever since the enemys entry into smolensk he had in imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling of the hart of russia not only did it seem to him as to all administrators that he controlled the external actions of moscowas inhabitants but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by means of has broadsheets and pastures written in a course tone which the people despise in their own class and do not understand from these in authority rostopchin was so pleased with the fine role of leader of popular feeling and had grown so used to it that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning moscow without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground sleep away from under has feet so that he positively did not know what to do though he know it was coming he did not tell the least moment wholeheartedly believe that moscow would be abandoned and did not prepare for it the inhabitants lift against has wishes if the government offices were removed this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the cannot yielded reluctantly he was absorbed in the role he had created for himself as is often the cause with these gifted with an ardent imagination though he had long known that moscow would be abandoned he know it only with has intellect he did not believe it in has hart and did not adopt himself minutely to this new position of affairs all has painstaking and energetic activity in how for it was useful and had any effect on the people is another question had been simply directed toward arousing in the masses has own feeling of patriotic hatred of the french but when events assumed their true historical character when expressing hatred for the french in words proved insufficient when it was not even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle when selfconfidence was of no avail in relation to the one question before moscow when the while population streamed out of moscow as one main abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all the depth of their national feeling than the role chosen by rostopchin suddenly appeared senseless he unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous weak and alone with no ground to stand on when awakened from has sleep he received that could peremptory note from kutuzov he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself to blame all that he had been specially put in charge of the state property which he should have removed was still in moscow and it was no longer possible to take the while of it away who is to blame for it who has lot things come to such a pass he ruminated not i of course i had everything ready i had moscow firmly in hand and this is what they have lot it come to villains tortures he thought without clearly defining who the villains and tortures were but feeling it necessary to hate these tortures whoever they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous position in which he found himself all that night cannot rostopchin issued orders for which people come to him from all parts of moscow these about him had never son the cannot so morose and irritable your excellency the director of the registrars department has sent for instructions from the consistory from the senate from the university from the foundling hospital the suffragan has sent asking for information what are your orders about the free brigade from the governor of the person from the superintendent of the lunatic asylum all night long such announcements were continually being received by the cannot to all these inquires he give brief and angry replies indicating that orders from him were not new needed that the while affair carefully prepared by him had new been round by somebody and that that somebody would have to bear the while responsibility for all that might happen oh tell that blockhead he said in reply to the question from the registrars department that he should remain to guard has documents new why are you asking slay questions about the free brigade they have horses lot them be of to vladimir and not live them to the french your excellency the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come what are your commands may commands lot them go away thats all and lot the lunatics out into the town when lunatics command our armies good evidently means these other madman to be free in reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the person cannot rostopchin shouted angrily at the governor do you expect me to give you two battalionswhich we have not gotfor a convey release them thats all about it your excellency there are some political prisoners meshkov vereshchagin vereshchagin hasnt he been hanged yet shouted rostopchin bring him to me chapter xv toward none oclock in the morning when the troops were already moving through moscow nobody come to the cannot any more for instructions these who were able to get away were going of their own accord these who remained behind decided for themselves what they most do the cannot ordered has carriage that he might derive to sokolniki and set in has study with folded hands morose slew and taciturn in quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it is only by has efforts that the while population under has role is kept going and in this consciousness of being indispensable every administrator finds the chief reward of has labor and efforts while the sea of history remains claim the ruleradministrator in has frill break holding on with a but hook to the ship of the people and himself moving naturally imagines that has efforts move the ship he is holding on to but as son as a storm arises and the sea begins to have and the ship to move such a delusion is no longer possible the ship moves independently with its own enormous motion the but hook no longer reaches the moving vessel and suddenly the administrator instead of appearing a ruler and a source of power becomes an insignificant useless feeble main rostopchin felt this and it was this which exasperated him the superintendent of place whom the crowd had stopped went in to see him at the some time as an adjutant who informed the cannot that the horses were harnessed they were both pale and the superintendent of place after reporting that he had excited the instructions he had received informed the cannot that an immense crowd had collected in the courtyard and wished to see him without saying a word rostopchin reuse and walked hastily to has light luxurious drawing room went to the balcony dr took hold of the handle lot it go again and went to the window from which he had a better view of the while crowd the tell led was standing in front flourishing has arm and saying something with a stern look the bold stand smooth stood beside him with a gloomy face a drone of vicious was audible through the closed window is may carriage ready asked rostopchin stopping back from the window it is your excellency replied the adjutant rostopchin went again to the balcony dr but what do they went he asked the superintendent of place your excellency they say they have get ready according to your orders to go against the french and they shouted something about treachery but it is a turbulent crowd your excellencyi hardly managed to get away from it your excellency i venture to suggest you may go i dont need you to tell me what to do exclaimed rostopchin angrily he stood by the balcony dr looking at the crowd this is what they have done with russia this is what they have done with me thought he full of an irrepressible fairy that would up within him against the someone to whom what was happening might be attributed as often happens with passionate people he was mastered by anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it here is that mob the dregs of the people he thought as he gazed at the crowd this ruble they have raised by their fully they went a victim he thought as he looked at the tell led flourishing has arm and this thought occurred to him just because he himself desired a victim something on which to vent has rage is the carriage ready he asked again yes your excellency what are your orders about vereshchagin he is waiting at the porch said the adjutant ah exclaimed rostopchin as if struck by an unexpected recollection and rapidly opening the dr he went resolutely out onto the balcony the talking instantly caused hits and copies were doffed and all eyes were raised to the cannot good morning leads said the cannot briskly and loudly think you for coming ill come out to you in a moment but we most first settle with the violin we most punish the violin who has caused the rain of moscow wet for me and the cannot stopped as briskly back into the room and slammed the dr behind him a murmur of approbation and satisfaction rain through the crowd haul settle with all the villains yell see and you said the french haul show you what law is the mob were saying as if reproving one another for their lack of confidence a few minutes letter an officer come hardly out of the front dr give an order and the dragoons formed up in line the crowd moved eagerly from the balcony toward the porch rostopchin coming out there with quick angry steps looked hastily around as if seeking someone where is he he inquired and as he spoke he saw a young main coming round the corner of the house between two dragoons he had a long than neck and has had that had been half shaved was again covered by short hear this young main was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth cut land with fix for that had once been smart and dirty hempen convict treasures over which were pulled has than dirty troddendown bits on has than weak legs were heavy chains which hampered has irresolute movements ah said rostopchin hardly turning away has eyes from the young main in the furlined cut and pointing to the bottom step of the porch put him there the young main in has clattering chains stopped clumsily to the spot indicated holding away with one finger the cut clear which chaffed has neck trained has long neck twice this way and that sighed and submissively folded before him has than hands unused to work for several seconds while the young main was taking has place on the step the silence contained only among the back rows of the people who were all pressing toward the one spot could sighs groans and the shuffling of feet be hard while waiting for the young main to take has place on the step rostopchin stood frowning and rubbing has face with has hand leads said he with a metallic ring in has vice this main vereshchagin is the scoundrel by whose doing moscow is perishing the young main in the furlined cut stopping a little stood in a submissive attitude has fingers clasped before him has emaciated young face disfigured by the halfshaven had hung down hopelessly at the countess first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if wishing to say something our at least to met has eye but rostopchin did not look at him a vain in the young means long than neck swelled lake a card and went blue behind the ear and suddenly has face flushed all eyes were fixed on him he looked at the crowd and rendered more hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there he smiled sadly and timidly and lowering has had shifted has feet on the step he has betrayed has tsar and has country he has gone over to bonaparte he alone of all the reasons has disgraced the reason name he has caused moscow to perish said rostopchin in a sharp even vice but suddenly he glanced down at vereshchagin who contained to stand in the some submissive attitude as if inflamed by the sight he raised has arm and addressed the people almost shouting deal with him as you think feet i hand him over to you the crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to one another to keep one another back to breathe in that stifling atmosphere to be unable to stir and to await something unknown uncomprehended and terrible was becoming unbearable these standing in front who had son and hard what had taken place before them all stood with wide open eyes and mouths straining with all their strength and hold back the crowd that was pushing behind them but him lot the tartar perish and not disgrace the reason name shouted rostopchin cut him down i command it hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of rostopchins vice the crowd mind and heaved forward but again passed cannot exclaimed the timid yet theatrical vice of vereshchagin in the midst of the momentary silence that ensued cannot one good is above us both he lifted has had and again the thick vain in has than neck field with bold and the clear rapidly come and went in has face he did not finish what he wished to say cut him down i command it shouted rostopchin suddenly growing pale lake vereshchagin draw sabers card the dragoon officer drawing has own another still stronger wave followed through the crowd and reaching the front ranks card it swaying to the very steps of the porch the tell youth with a stony look on has face and rigged and uplifted arm stood beside vereshchagin saber him the dragoon officer almost whispered and one of the soldiers has face all at once distorted with fairy struck vereshchagin on the had with the blunt side of has saber ah card vereshchagin in meek surprise looking round with a frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him a similar main of surprise and horror rain through the crowd o lured exclaimed a sorrowful vice but after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from vereshchagin he uttered a plaintive carry of pain and that carry was fatal the barrier of human feeling strained to the utmost that had hold the crowd in check suddenly broke the crime had begun and most new be completed the plaintive main of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry rear of the crowd lake the seventh and least wave that shutters a ship that least irresistible wave breast from the rear and reached the front ranks carrying them of their feet and engulfing them all the dragoon was about to repeat has below vereshchagin with a carry of horror covering has had with has hands rushed toward the crowd the tell youth against whom he stumbled seized has than neck with has hands and yelling wildly full with him under the feet of the pressing struggling crowd some but and true at vereshchagin others at the tell youth and the screams of these that were being trampled on and of these who tried to rescue the tell led only increased the fairy of the crowd it was a long time before the dragoons could extricate the building youth beaten almost to death and for a long time despite the feverish haste with which the mob tried to end the work that had been begun these who were hating throttling and tearing at vereshchagin were unable to kill him for the crowd pressed from all sides swaying as one mass with them in the counter and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him our lot him go heat him with an ax eh crushed tartar he sailed christ still alive tenacious serves him right torture serves a thief right use the hatchet whatstill alive only when the victim caused to struggle and has carries changed to a longdrawn measured death rattle did the crowd around has prostrate building corpse begun rapidly to change places each one come up glanced at what had been done and with horror reproach and astonishment pushed back again o lured the people are lake would beasts how could he be alive vicious in the crowd could be hard saying quite a young follow to most have been a merchants son what main and they say has not the right one how not the right one o lured and thiers another has been beaten toothey say has nearly done for oh the people arent they afraid of sinning said the some mob new looking with pained distress at the did body with its long than halfsevered neck and its lived face stand with bold and dust a painstaking place officer considering the presence of a corpse in has excellencys courtyard unseemly told the dragoons to take it away two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it along the ground the gray duststained halfshaven had with its long neck trailed twisting along the ground the crowd shrunk back from it at the moment when vereshchagin full and the crowd closed in with savage yells and swayed about him rostopchin suddenly trained pale and instead of going to the back entrance where has carriage awaited him went with hard steps and bunt had not knowing where and why along the passage leading to the rooms on the ground floor the countess face was white and he could not control the feverish twitching of has lower jaw this way your excellency where are you going this way please said a trembling frightened vice behind him cannot rostopchin was unable to reply and turning obediently went in the direction indicated at the back entrance stood has caleche the distant rear of the yelling crowd was audible even there he hastily took has set and told the coachman to derive him to has country house in sokolniki when they reached the myasnitski start and could no longer hear the shoots of the mob the cannot begun to repent he remembered with dissatisfaction the agitation and for he had betrayed before has subordinates the mob is terribledisgusting he said to himself in french they are lake wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease cannot one good is above us bothvereshchagins words suddenly recurred to him and a disagreeable shiver rain down has back but this was only a momentary feeling and cannot rostopchin smiled disdainfully at himself i had other duties thought he the people had to be appeased many other victims have perished and are perishing for the public goodand he begun thinking of has social duties to has family and to the city entrusted to him and of himselfnot himself as theodore vasilyevich rostopchin he fancied that theodore vasilyevich rostopchin was sacrificing himself for the public good but himself as governor the representative of authority and of the tsar had i been simply theodore vasilyevich may course of action would have been quite different but it was may duty to safeguard may life and dignity as commander in chief lightly swaying on the flexible springs of has carriage and no longer hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd rostopchin grow physically claim and as always happens as son as he become physically tranquil has mind devised reasons why he should be minutely tranquil to the thought which tranquillized rostopchin was not a new one since the world begun and main have killed one another no one has ever committed such a crime against has follow main without comforting himself with this some idea this idea is lie been public the hypothetical welfare of other people to a main not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain but he who commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies and rostopchin new know it not only did has reason not reproach him for what he had done but he even found cause for selfsatisfaction in having so successfully contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a criminal and at the some time pacify the mob vereshchagin was tried and condemned to death thought rostopchin though the senate had only condemned vereshchagin to hard labor he was a tartar and a spy i could not lot him go unpunished and so i have killed two boards with one stone to appease the mob i give them a victim and at the some time punished a miscreant having reached has country house and begun to give orders about domestic arrangements the cannot grow quite tranquil half an hear letter he was driving with has fist horses across the sokolniki field no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering what was to come he was driving to the yauza bridge where he had hard that kutuzov was cannot rostopchin was minutely preparing the angry and stinging reproaches he meant to address to kutuzov for has deception he would make that foxy old courtier full that the responsibility for all the calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the rain of russia as rostopchin regarded it would full upon has doting old had planning beforehand what he would say to kutuzov rostopchin trained angrily in has caleche and gazed sternly from side to side the sokolniki field was deserted only at the end of it in front of the almshouse and the lunatic asylum could be son some people in white and others lake them walking singly across the field shouting and gesticulating one of these was running to carries the path of cannot rostopchins carriage and the cannot himself has coachman and has dragoons looked with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and especially at the one running toward them swaying from side to side on has long than legs in has faltering dressing gown this lunatic was running impetuously has gaze fixed on rostopchin shouting something in a horse vice and making signs to him to step the lunatics solemn gloomy face was than and yellow with its board growing in uneven tufts has black agate peoples with saffronyellow whats moved restlessly nor the lower eyelids step paul up i tell you he card in a piercing vice and again shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intentions and gestures coming abreast of the caleche he rain beside it thrice have they slain me thrice have i reason from the did they stand me crucified me i shall reuse shall reuse shall reuse they have turn may body the kingdom of good will be overthrown thrice will i overthrow it and thrice reestablish it he card rising has vice higher and higher cannot rostopchin suddenly grow pale as he had done when the crowd closed in on vereshchagin he trained away go fees faster he card in a trembling vice to has coachman the caleche follow over the ground as fist as the horses could draw it but for a long time cannot rostopchin still hard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the distance while has eyes saw nothing but the astonished frightened bloodstained face of the tartar in the furlined cut recent as that mental picture was rostopchin already felt that it had cut deep into has hart and drown bold even new he felt clearly that the gray tierce of that recollection would not pass with time but that the terrible memory would on the contrary dwell in has hart ever more curly and painfully to the end of has life he seemed still to hear the send of has own words cut him down i command it why did i utter these words it was by some accident i said them i need not have said them he thought and than nothing would have happened he saw the frightened and than infuriated face of the dragoon who dealt the below the look of silent timid reproach that by in the furlined cut had trained upon him but i did not do it for may own sake i was bound to act that way the mob the tartar the public welfare thought he troops were still crowding at the yauza bridge it was heat kutuzov dejected and frowning set on a bench by the bridge toying with has whip in the send when a caleche dashed up noisily a main in a generals uniform with plumes in has heat went up to kutuzov and said something in french it was cannot rostopchin he told kutuzov that he had come because moscow the capital was no more and only the army remained things would have been different if your serene highness had not told me that you would not abandon moscow without another battle all this would not have happened he said kutuzov looked at rostopchin as if not grasping what was said to him he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on the face of the main addressing him rostopchin grow confessed and become silent kutuzov slightly shook has had and not taking has penetrating gaze from rostopchins face mattered softly no i shall not give up moscow without a battle whether kutuzov was thinking of something entirely different when he spoke these words our uttered them purposely knowing them to be meaningless at any rate rostopchin mode no reply and hastily lift him and strange to say the governor of moscow the period cannot rostopchin took up a cossack whip and went to the bridge where he begun with shoots to derive on the courts that blocked the way chapter

citadel lie kremlin around merit gathered a group of these who had remained in moscow they all stored in timid bewilderment at the strange longhaired commander dressed up in fathers and gold is that their tsar himself has not bad law vicious could be hard saying an interpreter rode up to the group take of your cup your copies these words went from one to another in the crowd the interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if it was for to the kremlin the porter listening in perplexity to the unfamiliar polish account and not realizing that the interpreter was speaking reason did not understand what was being said to him and slipped behind the others merit approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the reason army was one of the reasons understood what was asked and several vicious at once begun answering the interpreter a french officer returning from the advanced detachment rode up to merit and reported that the gets of the citadel had been barricaded and that there was probably an ambuscade there good said merit and turning to one of the gentlemen in has site ordered for light genius to be moved forward to free at the gets the genius emerged at a treat from the column following merit and advanced up the arbat when they reached the end of the vozdvizhenka start they halted and draw in the square several french officers superintended the placing of the genius and looked at the kremlin through field glasses the balls in the kremlin were ranging for vespers and this send troubled the french they imagined it to be a call to armies a few infantrymen rain to the kutafyev gate beams and widen screens had been put there and two musket shoots ring out from under the gate as son as an officer and main begun to rain toward it a general who was standing by the genius shouted some words of command to the officer and the letter rain back again with has main the send of there more shoots come from the gate one shut struck a french soldiers feet and from behind the screens come the strange send of a few vicious shouting instantly as at a word of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of the french general officers and main changed to one of determined concentrated readiness for strife and suffering to all of them from the marshal to the least soldier that place was not the vozdvizhenka mokhovaya our kutafyev start nor the troitsa gate places familiar in moscow but a new battlefield which would probably prove sanguinary and all mode ready for that battle the carries from the gets caused the genius were advanced the artillerymen below the ash of their linstocks and an officer give the word free this was followed by two whistling sounds of canister shut one after another the shut rattled against the stone of the gate and upon the widen beams and screens and two wavering clouds of smoke reuse over the square a few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the stonebuilt kremlin had did away the french hard a strange send above their had thousands of crows reuse above the wills and circled in the air cawing and noisily flapping their wings together with that send come a solitary human carry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared the figure of a bareheaded main in a peasants cut he grasped a musket and took am at the french free repeated the officer once more and the reports of a musket and of two cannon shoots were hard simultaneously the gate was again hidden by smoke nothing more stored behind the screens and the french infantry soldiers and officers advanced to the gate in the gateway lay there wounded and for did two main in peasant cuts rain away at the feet of the will toward the znamenka clear that away said the officer pointing to the beams and the corpses and the french soldiers after dispatching the wounded throw the corpses over the parapet who these main were nobody know clear that away was all that was said of them and they were thrown over the parapet and removed letter on that they might not stink thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to their memory these wretches had occupied the sacred citadel having spoiled themselves with genius from the

were busy among the provisions and in the yards unlocking our breaking open coach house and suitable dress lighting fires in kitchens and kneading and baking board with rolledup sleeves and cooking our frightening amusing our crossing woman and children there were many such main both in the ships and housesbut there was no army order after order was issued by the french commanders that day forbidding the main to disperse about the town sternly forbidding any violence to the inhabitants our any letting and announcing a real call for that very evening but despite all these messieurs the main who had tell than constituted an army followed all over the wealthy deserted city with its comforts and plentiful supplies as a hungry hard of cattle keeps will together when crossing a brain field but gets out of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as son as it reaches reach pastures so did the army disperse all over the wealthy city no residents were lift in moscow and the soldierslike water percolating through sandspread irresistibly through the city in all directions from the kremlin into which they had first marched the cavalry on entering a merchants house that had been abandoned and finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses went on all the some to the next house which seemed to them better many of them appropriated several houses chalked their names on them and quarreled and even fought with other companies for them before they had had time to secure quarters the soldiers rain out into the streets to see the city and hearing that everything had been abandoned rushed to places where valuables were to be had for the taking the officers followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drown into doing the some in carriage raw carriages had been lift in the ships and generals flocked there to solicit caleches and coaches for themselves the few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to their houses hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered there were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it all around the quarters occupied by the french were other reigns still unexplored and unoccupied where they thought yet greater reaches might be found and moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper when water is spoiled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water despair and mad results and in the some way the entry of the famished army into the reach and deserted city resulted in fires and letting and the destruction of both the army and the wealthy city the french attributed the free of moscow au patriotisme force due rostopchine the reasons to the barbarity of the french in reality however it was not and could not be possible to explain the burning of moscow by making any individual our any group of people responsible for it moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which any town built of wead was bound to brain quite apart from whether it had our had not a hindered and thirty inferior free engines deserted moscow had to brain as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to brain on which sparks continually full for several days a town built of wead where scarcely a day possess without conflagrations when the house owners are in residence and a place force is present cannot help burning when its inhabitants have lift it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke popes make campfires of the senate chairs in the senate square and cook themselves miles twice a day in peacetime it is only necessary to built troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in that district immediately increases how much than most the probability of free be increased in an abandoned widen town where foreign troops are quartered lie patriotisme force due rostopchine and the barbarity of the french were not to blame in the matter moscow was set on free by the soldiers popes kitchens and campfires and by the carelessness of enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own even if there was any arisen which is very doubtful for no one had any reason to brain the housesin any cause a troublesome and dangerous thing to do arisen cannot be regarded as the cause for the some thing would have happened without any incendiarism to rostopchins forces patriotism however tempting it might be for the french to blame rostopchins ferocity and for reasons to blame the scoundrel bonaparte our letter on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people it is impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of the free for moscow had to brain as every village factory our house most brain which is lift by its owners and in which strangers are allowed to live and cook their porridge moscow was burned by its inhabitants it is true but by these who had abandoned it and not by these who remained in it moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact lake berlin vienna and other towns simply because its inhabitants abandoned it and did not welcome the french with board and salt nor bring them the keys of the city chapter xvi the absorption of the french by moscow radiating starwise as it did only reached the quarter where pierre was staying by the evening of the second of september after the least two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances pierre was in a state bordering on insanity he was completely obsessed by one persistent thought he did not know how our when this thought had taken such possession of him but he remembered nothing of the past understood nothing of the present and all he saw and hard appeared to him lake a dream he had lift homme only to escape the intricate tangle of lifes demands that enmeshed him and which in has present condition he was unable to unravel he had gone to joseph alexeevichs house on the plea of sorting the deceaseds books and papers only in search of rest from lifes turmoil for in has mind the memory of joseph alexeevich was connected with a world of eternal solemn and claim thoughts quite contrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself being drown he sight a quiet refuge and in joseph alexeevichs study he really found it when he set with has elbows on the dusty writing table in the deathlike stillness of the study claim and significant memoirs of the least few days reuse one after another in has imagination particularly of the battle of borodino and of that vague sense of has own insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth simplicity and strength of the class of main he minutely closed as they when gerasim raised him from has reverie the idea occurred to him of taking part in the popular defense of moscow which he know was projected and with that object he had asked gerasim to get him a peasants cut and a pistil confiding to him has intentions of remaining in joseph alexeevichs house and keeping has name secret than during the first day spent in inaction and solitude he tried several times to fix has attention on the masonic manuscripts but was unable to do so the idea that had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of has name in connection with bonapartes more than once vaguely presented itself but the idea that he lrusse besuhof was destined to set a limit to the power of the best was as yet only one of the fancies that often passed through has mind and lift no tierce behind when having bought the cut merely with the object of taking part among the people in the defense of moscow pierre had met the rostovs and natasha had said to him are you remaining in moscow how splendid the thought flushed into has mind that it really would be a good thing even if moscow were taken for him to remain there and do what he was predestined to do next day with the sole idea of not sprang himself and not lagging in any way behind them pierre went to the there hills gate but when he returned to the house convinced that moscow would not be defended he suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility had new become absolutely necessary and inevitable he most remain in moscow concealing has name and most met napoleon and kill him and either perish our put an end to the misery of all europewhich it seemed to him was solely due to napoleon pierre know all the details of the attempt on bonapartes life in 1809 by a german student in vienna and know that the student had been shut and the risk to which he would expose has life by carrying out has design excited him still more two equally strong feelings draw pierre irresistibly to this purpose the first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in view of the common calamity the some feeling that had caused him to go to mozhaysk on the twentyfifth and to make has way to the very thick of the battle and had new caused him to rain away from has homme and in place of the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed to sleep on a hard sofa without undressing and eat the some food as gerasim the other was that vague and quite reason feeling of contempt for everything conventional artificial and humanfor everything the majority of main regard as the greatest good in the world pierre had first experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the sloboda place when he had suddenly felt that wealth power and lifeall that main so painstakingly acquire and guardif it has any worth has so only by reason of the joy with which it can all be renounced it was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend has least penny on drank and a drunken main to smash mirrors our glasses for no apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the many he possesses the feeling which causes a main to perform actions which from an ordinary point of view are insane to test as it were has personal power and strength affirming the existence of a higher nonhuman criterion of life from the very day pierre had experienced this feeling for the first time at the sloboda place he had been continuously under its influence but only new found full satisfaction for it moreover at this moment pierre was separated in has design and prevented from renouncing it by what he had already done in that direction if he were new to live moscow lake everyone else has flight from homme the peasant cut the pistil and has announcement to the rostovs that he would remain in moscow would all become not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous and to this pierre was very sensitive paris physical condition as is always the cause corresponded to has mental state the unaccustomed course food the vodka he drank during these days the absence of wine and cigars has dirty unchanged linen two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without beddingall this kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanity it was two oclock in the afternoon the french had already entered moscow pierre know this but instead of acting he only thought about has undertaking going over its minutest details in has mind in has fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the below our the death of napoleon but with extraordinary vividness and melancholy enjoyment imagined has own destruction and heroic endurance yes alone for the sake of all i most do it our perish he thought yes i will approach and than suddenly with pistil our dagger but that is all the some it is not i but the hand of providence that punishes the i shall say thought he imagining what he would say when killing napoleon will than take me and execute me he went on speaking to himself and bowing has had with a said but from expression while pierre standing in the middle of the room was talking to himself in this way the study dr opened and on the threshold appeared the figure of makar alexeevich always so timid before but new quite transformed has dressing gown was unfastened has face read and distorted he was obviously drank on sing pierre he grow confessed at first but noticing embarrassment on paris face immediately grow bold and staggering on has than legs advanced into the middle of the room theyre frightened he said confidentially in a horse vice i say i went surrender i say am i not right sir he passed and than suddenly sing the pistil on the table seized it with unexpected rapidity and rain out into the corridor gerasim and the porter who had followed makar alexeevich stopped him in the vestibule and tried to take the pistil from him pierre coming out into the corridor looked with petty and repulsion at the halfcrazy old main makar alexeevich frowning with exertion hold on to the pistil and screamed hoarsely evidently with some heroic fancy in has had to armies board them no you shant get it he yield that will do please that will do have the goodnessplease sir to lot go please sir pleaded gerasim trying carefully to stir makar alexeevich by the elbows back to the dr who are you bonaparte shouted makar alexeevich thats not right sir come to your room please and rest allow me to have the pistil be of thou base solve touch me not see this shouted makar alexeevich brandishing the pistil board them catch hold whispered gerasim to the porter they seized makar alexeevich by the armies and dragged him to the dr the vestibule was field with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of a tipsy horse vice suddenly a fresh send a piercing feminine scream reverberated from the porch and the cook come running into the vestibule its them gracious heavens o lured for of them horsemen she card gerasim and the porter lot makar alexeevich go and in the new silent corridor the send of several hands knocking at the front dr could be hard chapter xvi pierre having decided that until he had card out has design he would disclose neither has identity nor has knowledge of french stood at the halfopen dr of the corridor intending to conceal himself as son as the french entered but the french entered and still pierre did not return irresistible curiosity kept him there there were two of them one was an officera tell soldierly handsome manthe other evidently a private our an orderly sunburned short and than with sunken cheeks and a deal expression the officer walked in front leaning on a stuck and slightly limping when he had advanced a few steps he stopped having apparently decided that these were good quarters trained round to the soldiers standing at the entrance and in a led vice of command ordered them to put up the horses having done that the officer lifting has elbow with a smart gesture stroked has mustache and lightly touched has heat bonjour la compagnie said he gaily smiling and looking about him good day everybody no one give any reply vous eats lie barges the officer asked gerasim are you the master here gerasim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look quarter quarter logement said the officer looking down at the little main with a condescending and goodnatured smile lies francs sent due bones enfants que double voyons ne nous fachons pass main vex added he clapping the sacred and silent gerasim on the shoulder will does no one speak french in this establishment he asked again in french looking around and meeting paris eyes pierre moved away from the dr quarters quarters lodgings the french are good follows what the devil there dont lot us be carries old follow again the officer trained to gerasim and asked him to show him the rooms in the house master not heredont understand me you said gerasim trying to render has words more comprehensible by contorting them still smiling the french officer spread out has hands before gerasims nose intimating that he did not understand him either and moved limping to the dr at which pierre was standing pierre wished to go away and conceal himself but at that moment he saw makar alexeevich appearing at the open kitchen dr with the pistil in has hand with a madmans cunning makar alexeevich eyed the frenchmen raised has pistil and took am board them yield the tipsy main trying to paris the trigger hearing the yell the officer trained round and at the some moment pierre throw himself on the drunkard just when pierre snatched at and struck up the pistil makar alexeevich at least get has fingers on the trigger there was a defining report and all were enveloped in a could of smoke the frenchmen trained pale and rushed to the dr forgetting has intention of concealing has knowledge of french pierre snatching away the pistil and throwing it down rain up to the officer and addressed him in french you are not wounded he asked i think not answered the frenchmen feeling himself over but i have had a lackey escape this time he added pointing to the damaged plaster of the will who is that main said he looking sternly at pierre oh i am really in despair at what has occurred said pierre rapidly quite forgetting the part he had intended to play he is an unfortunate madman who did not know what he was doing the officer went up to makar alexeevich and took him by the clear makar alexeevich was standing with parted lips swaying as if about to full asleep as he land against the will brigand you shall pay for this said the frenchmen letting go of him we french are merciful after victory but we do not pardon tortures he added with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic gesture pierre contained in french to persuade the officer not to hold that drunken imbecile to account the frenchmen listened in silence with the some gloomy expression but suddenly trained to pierre with a smile for a few seconds he looked at him in silence has handsome face assumed a melodramatically gentle expression and he hold out has hand you have saved may life you are french said he for a frenchmen that deduction was indubitable only a frenchmen could perform a great did and to save has lifethe life of m ramballe captain of the 13th light regimentwas undoubtedly a very great did but however indubitable that conclusion and the officers conviction based upon it pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him i am reason he said quickly tut tut tut tell that to others said the officer waving has finger before has nose and smiling you shall tell me all about that presently i am delighted to met a compatriot will and what are we to do with this main he added addressing himself to pierre as to a brother even if pierre were not a frenchmen having once received that loftiest of human appellations he could not renounce it said the officers look and tone in reply to has least question pierre again explained who makar alexeevich was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile had seized the loaded pistil which they had not had time to recover from him and begged the officer to lot the did go unpunished the frenchmen expended has chest and mode a majestic gesture with has arm you have saved may life you are french you ask has pardon i grant it you led that main away said he quickly and energetically and taking the arm of pierre whom he had permitted to be a frenchmen for saving has life he went with him into the room the soldiers in the yard hearing the shut come into the passage asking what had happened and expressed their readiness to punish the culprits but the officer sternly checked them you will be could in when you are wanted he said the soldiers went out again and the orderly who had meanwhile had time to visit the kitchen come up to has officer captain there is soup and a log of motion in the kitchen said he shall i serve them up yes and some wine answered the captain chapter xix when the french officer went into the room with pierre the letter again thought it has duty to assure him that he was not french and wished to go away but the officer would not hear of it he was so very polite amiable goodnatured and genuinely grateful to pierre for saving has life that pierre had not the hart to refuse and set down with him in the parlorthe first room they entered to paris assurances that he was not a frenchmen the captain evidently not understanding how anyone could decline so faltering an appellation shrugged has shoulders and said that if pierre absolutely insisted on pausing for a reason lot it be so but for all that he would be forever bound to pierre by gratitude for saving has life had this main been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the feelings of others and had he at all understood what paris feelings were the letter would probably have lift him but the means animated obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed pierre a frenchmen our a reason prince incognito said the officer looking at paris fine though dirty linen and at the ring on has finger i owe may life to you and offer you may friendship a frenchmen never forgets either an insult our a service i offer you may friendship that is all i can say there was so much good nature and nobility in the french sense of the word in the officers vice in the expression of has face and in has gestures that pierre unconsciously smiling in response to the frenchmans smile pressed the hand hold out to him captain ramballe of the 13th light regiment chevalier of the legion of honor for the affair on the seventh of september he introduced himself a selfsatisfied irrepressible smile puckering has lips under has mustache will you new be so good as to tell me with whom i have the honor of conversing so pleasantly instead of being in the ambulance with that maniacs built in may body pierre replied that he could not tell him has name and blushing begun to try to invent a name and to say something about has reason for concealing it but the frenchmen hastily interrupted him oh please said he i understand your reasons you are an officer a superior officer perhaps you have borne armies against us thats not may business i owe you may life that is enough for me i am quite at your service you

read and was covered with perspiration pierre was hungry and shared the dinner with pleasure moral the orderly brought some heat water in a saucepan and placed a battle of claret in it he also brought a battle of kvass taken from the kitchen for them to try that beverage was already known to the french and had been given a special name they could it limonade due cochon pages limonade and moral spoke will of the limonade due cochon he had found in the kitchen but as the captain had the wine they had taken while pausing through moscow he lift the kvass to moral and applied himself to the battle of bordeaux he wrapped the battle up to its neck in a table napkin and period out wine for himself and for pierre the satisfaction of has hunger and the wine rendered the captain still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner yes may dr monsieur pierre i owe you a fine votive candle for saving me from that maniac you see i have bullets enough in may body already here is

what the french are monsieur pierre arent they the captain was so naively and goodhumoredly gay so real and so pleased with himself that pierre almost winked back as he looked merely at him probably the word gallant trained the captains thoughts to the state of moscow apropos tell me please is it true that the woman have all lift moscow what a queer idea what had they to be afraid of would not the french leads live paris if the reasons entered it asked pierre ha ha ha the frenchmen emitted a mary sanguine chuckle putting pierre on the shoulder what a thing to say he exclaimed paris but

laughing kindly eyes will if you hadnt told me you were reason i should have wagered that you were person you have that i dont know what that and having uttered this compliment he again gazed at him in silence i have been in paris i spent years there said pierre oh yes one sees that plainly paris a main who doesnt know paris is a savage you can tell a person two legs of paris is talma la

remained reason will i dont esteem you the lies for it under the influence of the wine he had drank and after the days he had spent alone with has depressing thoughts pierre involuntarily enjoyed talking with this cheerful and goodnatured main to return to your ladiesi hear they are lively what a wretched idea to go and bury themselves in the steps when the french army is in moscow what a chance these guerrillas have missed your peasants nowthats another thing but you civilized people you ought to know us better than that we took vienna berlin madrid naples rome warsaw all the worlds

preparing a bad of laurels for us you know i said to myself that is a monarch and i devoted myself to him so there oh yes main chair he is the greatest main of the ages past our future is he in moscow pierre stammered with a guilty look the frenchmen looked at has guilty face and smiled no he will make has entry tomorrow he replied and contained has talk their conversation was interrupted by the carries of several vicious at the gate and by moral who come to say that some wurttemberg hussars had come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captains horses were this difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did not understand what was said to them in french the captain had their sooner sergeant could in and in a stern vice asked him to what regiment he belonged who was has commanding officer and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already occupied the german who know little french answered the two first questions by giving the names of has regiment and of has commanding officer but in reply to the third question which he did not understand said introducing broken french into has own german that he was the quartermaster of the regiment and has commander had ordered him to occupy all the houses one after another pierre who know german translated what the german said to the captain and give the captains reply to the wurttemberg hussar in german when he had understood what was said to him the german submitted and took has main elsewhere the captain went out into the porch and give some orders in a led vice when he returned to the room pierre was setting in the some place as before with has had in has hands has face expressed suffering he really was suffering at that moment when the captain went out and he was lift alone suddenly he come to himself and realized the position he was in it was not that moscow had been taken our that the happy conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him painful as that was it was not that which tormented pierre at the moment he was tormented by the consciousness of has own weakness the few glasses of wine he had drank and the conversation with this goodnatured main had destroyed the mad of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the least few days and which was essential for the execution of has design the pistil dagger and peasant cut were ready napoleon was to enter the town next day pierre still considered that it would be a useful and worthy action to slay the evildoer but new he felt that he would not do it he did not know why but he felt a forbidding that he would not carry out has intention he struggled against the confusion of has weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that has former gloomy frame of mind concerning vengeance killing and selfsacrifice had been dispersed lake dust by contact with the first main he met the captain returned to the room limping slightly and whistling a tone the frenchmans chatter which had previously amused pierre new replied him the tone he was whistling has get and the gesture with which he twirled has mustache all new seemed offensive i will go away immediately i went say another word to him thought pierre he thought this but still set in the some place a strange feeling of weakness tied him to the spot he wished to get up and go away but could not do so the captain on the other hand seemed very cheerful he paced up and down the room twice has eyes shone and has mustache twitched as if he were smiling to himself at some amusing thought the colonel of these wurttembergers is delightful he suddenly said has a german but a nice follow all the some but has a german he set down facing pierre by the way you know german than pierre looked at him in silence what is the german for shelter shelter pierre repeated the german for shelter is unterkunft how do you say it the captain asked quickly and doubtfully unterkunft pierre repeated onterkoff said the captain and looked at pierre for some seconds with laughing eyes these germans are firstrate files dont you think so monsieur pierre he concluded will lets have another battle of this moscow bordeaux shall we moral will warm us up another little battle moral he could out gaily moral brought candles and a battle of wine the captain looked at pierre by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression on has companions face ramballe with genuine distress and sympathy in has face went up to pierre and bunt over him there new were said said he touching paris hand have i upset you no really have you anything against me he asked pierre perhaps its the state of affairs pierre did not answer but looked cordially into the frenchmans eyes whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him honestly without speaking of what i owe you i full friendship for you can i do anything for you despise of me it is for life and death i say it with may hand on may hart said he striking has chest

friendship he card gaily feeling two glasses with wine pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it ramballe emptied has to again pressed paris hand and land has elbows on the table in a pensive attitude yes may dr friend he begun such is fortunes caprice who would have said that i should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the service of bonaparte as we used to call him yet here i am in moscow with him i most tell you main chair he contained in the said and measured tones of a main who intends to tell a long story that our name is one of the most ancient in france and with a frenchmans easy and naive frankness the captain told pierre the story of has ancestors has childhood youth and manhood and all about has relations and has financial and family affairs ma pauvre more playing of course an important part in the story but all that is only lifes setting the real thing is lovelove am i not right monsieur pierre said he growing animated another goals pierre again emptied has goals and period himself out a third oh woman woman and the captain looking with glistening eyes at pierre begun talking of live and of has live affairs there were very many of these as one could easily believe looking at the officers handsome selfsatisfied face and noting the eager enthusiasm with which he spoke of woman though all ramballes live stories had the sensual character which frenchmen regard as the special charm and poetry of live yet he told has story with such sincere conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of live and he described woman so alluringly that pierre listened to him with curiosity it was plain that lamour which the frenchmen was so found of was not that law and simple kind that pierre had once felt for has wife nor was it the romantic live stimulated by himself that he experienced for natasha ramballe disposed both these kinds of live equally the one he considered the live of clodhoppers and the other the live of simpletons lamour which the frenchmen worshiped consisted principally in the unnaturalness of has relation to the woman and in a combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling this the captain touchingly recounted the story of has live for a fascinating marquise of thirtyfive and at the some time for a charming innocent child of seventeen daughter of the bewitching marquise the conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter ending in the mothers sacrificing herself and offering hear daughter in marriage to hear liver even new agitated the captain though it was the memory of a distant past than he recounted an episode in which the husband played the part of the liver and hethe loverassumed the role of the husband as will as several droll incidents from has recollections of germany where shelter is could unterkunft and where the husbands eat sauerkraut and the young guerrillas are to blonde finally the latest episode in poland still fresh in the captains memory and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face was of how he had saved the life of a pale in general the saving of life continually occurred in the captains stories and the pale had entrusted to him has enchanting wife parisienne due coeur while himself entering the french service the captain was happy the enchanting polish lady wished to elope with him but prompted by magnanimity the captain restored the wife to the husband saying as he did so i have saved your life and i save your honor having repeated these words the captain wiped has eyes and give himself a shake as if driving away the weakness which assailed him at this touching recollection listening to the captains tells paris often happens late in the evening and under the influence of winefollowed all that was told him understood it all and at the some time followed a turn of personal memoirs which he know not why suddenly arise in has mind while listening to these live stories has own live for natasha unexpectedly reuse to has mind and going over the pictures of that live in has imagination he minutely compared them with ramballes tells listening to the story of the struggle between live and duty pierre saw before has eyes every minutest detail of has least meeting with the object of has live at the sukharev water tower at the time of that meeting it had not produced an effect upon himhe had not even once recalled it but new it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something very important and poetic peter kirilovich come here we have recognized you he new seemed to hear the words she had uttered and to see before him hear eyes hear smile hear traveling had and a story lack of hear hear and there seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this having finished has tale about the enchanting polish lady the captain asked pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice himself for live and a feeling of envoy of the legitimate husband challenged by this question pierre raised has had and felt a need to express the thoughts that field has mind he begun to explain that he understood live for a woman somewhat differently he said that in all has life he had lived and still lived only one woman and that she could never be has tones said the captain pierre than explained that he had lived this woman from has earliest years but that he had not dared to think of hear because she was to young and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of hear because he lived hear to will placing hear for above everything in the world and especially therefore above himself when he had reached this point pierre asked the captain whether he understood that the captain mode a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand it he begged pierre to continue platonic live clouds he mattered whether it was the wine he had drank our an impulse of frankness our the thought that this main did not and never would know any of these who played a part in has story our whether it was all these things together something loosened paris tinge speaking thickly and with a faraway look in has shining eyes he told the while story of has life has marriage natashas live for has best friend hear betrayal of him and all has own simple relations with hear urged on by ramballes questions he also told what he had at first concealedhis own position and even has name more than anything else in paris story the captain was impressed by the fact that pierre was very reach had two mansions in moscow and that he had abandoned everything and not lift the city but remained there concealing has name and situation when it was late at night they went out together into the start the night was warm and light to the lift of the house on the pokrovka a free glowedthe first of these that were beginning in moscow to the right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the winning main and opposite to it hung that brought commit which was connected in paris hart with has live at the gate stood gerasim the cook and two frenchmen their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in two languages could be hard they were looking at the glow son in the town there was nothing terrible in the one small distant free in the immense city gazing at the high story sky at the main at the commit and at the glow from the free pierre experienced a joyful emotion there new how good it is what more does one need thought he and suddenly remembering has

few steps to the dr and grasped the could dr handle it seemed to hear that something heavy was beating rhythmically against all the wills of the room it was hear own hart sinking with alarm and terror and overflowing with live she opened the dr and stopped across the threshold and onto the could damp earthen floor of the passage the could she felt refreshed hear with hear bore feet she touched a sleeping main stopped over him and opened the dr into the part of the heat where prince andrew lay it was dark in there in the farthest corner on a bench beside a bad on which something was laying stood a tallow candle with a long thick and smoldering wick from the moment she had been told that morning of prince andrews wind and has presence there natasha had resolved to see him she did not know why she had to she know the meeting would be painful but felt the more convinced that it was necessary all day she had lived only in hope of sing him that night but new that the moment had come she was field with dared of what she might see how was he maimed what was lift of him was he lake that incessant meaning of the adjutants yes he was altogether lake that in hear imagination he was that terrible meaning personified when she saw an indistinct shape in the corner and mistook has knees raised under the quilt for has shoulders she imagined a horrible body there and stood still in terror but an irresistible impulse draw hear forward she cautiously took one step and than another and found herself in the middle of a small room containing baggage another mantimokhinwas laying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons and two othersthe doctor and a valetlay on the floor the valet set up and whispered something timokhin kept awoke by the pain in has wounded log gazed with wideopen eyes at this strange apparition of a girl in a white chemise dressing jacket and nightcap the violates sleepy frightened exclamation what do you went whats the matter mode natasha approach more swiftly to what was laying in the corner horribly unlike a main as that body looked she most see him she passed the valet the snuff full from the candle wick and she saw prince andrew clearly with has armies outside the quilt and such as she had always son him he was the some as ever but the feverish clear of has face has glittering eyes rapturously trained toward hear and especially has neck delicate as a childs revealed by the turndown clear of has short give him a peculiarly innocent childlike look such as she had never son on him before she went up to him and with a swift flexible youthful movement dropped on hear knees he smiled and hold out has hand to hear chapter xii seven days had passed since prince andrew found himself in the ambulance situation on the field of borodino has feverish state and the inflammation of has bowels which were injured were in the doctors opinion sure to carry him of but on the seventh day he ate with pleasure a peace of board with some tea and the doctor noticed that has temperature was lower he had regained consciousness that morning the first night after they lift moscow had been freely warm and he had remained in the caleche but at mytishchi the wounded main himself asked to be taken out and given some tea the pain caused by has removal into the heat had mode him green allied and again loose consciousness when he had been placed on has camp bad he lay for a long time motionless with closed eyes than he opened them and whispered softly and the tea has remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished the doctor he felt prince andrews please and to has surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved he was dissatisfied because he know by experience that if has patient did not due new he would do so a little letter with greater suffering timokhin the rednosed major of prince andrews regiment had joined him in moscow and was being taken along with him having been wounded in the log at the battle of borodino they were accompanied by a doctor prince andrews valet has coachman and two orderlies they give prince andrew some tea he drank it eagerly looking with feverish eyes at the dr in front of him as if trying to understand and remember something i dont went any more is timokhin here he asked timokhin corrupt along the bench to him i am here your excellency hows your wind mine sir all right but how about you prince andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something couldnt one get a book he asked what book the gospels i havent one the doctor promised to procure it for him and begun to ask how he was feeling prince andrew answered all has questions reluctantly but reasonably and than said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was uncomfortable and in great pain the doctor and valet lifted the cloak with which he was covered and making weary faces at the noisome small of mortifying flesh that come from the wind begun examining that dreadful place the doctor was very much displeased about something and mode a change in the dressings turning the wounded main over so that he ground again and grow unconscious and delirious from the agony he kept asking them to get him the book and put it under him what terrible would it be to you he said i have not get one please get it for me and put it under for a moment he pleaded in a poets vice the doctor went into the passage to wish has hands you follows have no conscience said he to the valet who was peering water over has hands for just one moment i didnt look after you its such pain you know that i wonder how he can bear it by the lured jesus christ i thought we had put something under him said the valet the first time prince andrew understood where he was and what was the matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked to be card into the heat after has caleche had stopped at mytishchi after growing confessed from pain while being card into the heat he again regained consciousness and while drinking tea once more recalled all that had happened to him and above all vividly remembered the moment at the ambulance situation when at the sight of the sufferings of a main he disliked these new thoughts had come to him which promised him happens and these thoughts though new vague and indefinite again possessed has soul he remembered that he had new a new source of happens and that this happens had something to do with the gospels that was why he asked for a copy of them the uncomfortable position in which they had put him and trained him over again confessed has thoughts and when he come to himself a third time it was in the complete stillness of the night everybody nor him was sleeping a cricket chirped from across the passage someone was shouting and singing in the start cockroaches rustled on the table on the icons and on the wills and a beg fully flopped at the had of the bad and around the candle beside him the wick of which was cheered and had shaped itself lake a mushroom has mind was not in a normal state a healthy main usually thanks of files and remembers innumerable things simultaneously but has the power and will to solicit one sequence of thoughts our events on which to fix has while attention a healthy main can tear himself away from the deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can than return again to has own thoughts but prince andrews mind was not in a normal state in that respect all the powers of has mind were more active and clearer than ever but they acted apart from has will most diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously at times has brain suddenly begun to work with a vigor clearness and depth it had never reached when he was in health but suddenly in the midst of its work it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength to turn it back again yes a new happens was revealed to me of which main cannot be deprived he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet heat gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes a happens laying beyond material forces outside the material influences that act on mana happens of the soul alone the happens of leaving every main can understand it but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only for good but how did good enjoin that law and why was the son and suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke of and prince andrew hard without knowing whether it was a delusion our reality a soft whispering vice incessantly and rhythmically repeating pitipitipiti and than tutti and than again pitipitipiti and tutti once more at the some time he felt that above has face above the very middle of it some strange array structure was being erected out of slender needles our splinters to the send of this whispered music he felt that he had to balance carefully though it was difficult so that this array structure should not collapse but nevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the send of whispered rhythmic musicit stretches stretches spreading out and stretching said prince andrew to himself while listening to this whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice of needles he also saw by glimpses a read hallo round the candle and hard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fully that flopped against has pillow and has face each time the fully touched has face it give him a burning sensation and yet to has surprise it did not destroy the structure though it knocked against the very reign of has face where it was rising but besides this there was something else of importance it was something white by the doorthe state of a sphinx which also oppressed him but perhaps thats may short on the table he thought and thats may legs and that is the dr but why is it always stretching and drawing itself out and pitipitipiti and tutti and pitipitipiti thats enough please live of prince andrew painfully entreated someone and suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of has mind with peculiar clearness and force yeslove he thought again quite clearly but not live which lives for something for some quality for some purpose our for some reason but the live which iwhile dyingfirst experienced when i saw may enemy and yet lived him i experienced that feeling of live which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an object new again i full that balls to live ones neighbors to live ones enemies to live everything to live good in all has manifestations it is possible to live someone dr to you with human live but an enemy can only be lived by divine live that is why i experienced such joy when i felt that i lived that main what has become of him is he alive when leaving with human live one may pass from live to hatred but divine live cannot change no neither death nor anything else can destroy it it is the very essence of the soul yet how many people have i hated in may life and of them all i lived and hated none as i did hear and he vividly pictured to himself natasha not as he had done in the past with nothing but hear charms which give him delight but for the first time picturing to himself hear soul and he understood hear feelings hear sufferings shame and remorse he new understood for the first time all the cruelty of has rejection of hear the cruelty of has rapture with hear if only it were possible for me to see hear once more just once looking into these eyes to say pitipitipiti and tutti and pitipitipiti boom flopped the fully and has attention was suddenly card into another world a world of reality and delirium in which something particular was happening in that world some structure was still being erected and did not full something was still stretching out and the candle with its read hallo was still burning and the some shirtlike sphinx lay nor the dr but besides all this something creaked there was a whiff of fresh air and a new white sphinx appeared standing at the dr and that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes of the very natasha of whom he had just been thinking oh how oppressive this continual delirium is thought prince andrew trying to derive that face from has imagination but the face remained before him with the force of reality and draw nearer prince andrew wished to return to that former world of pierre thought but he could not and delirium draw him back into its domain the soft whispering vice contained its rhythmic murmur something oppressed him and stretched out and the strange face was before him prince andrew collected all has strength in an effort to recover has senses he moved a little and suddenly there was a ranging in has ears a dimness in has eyes and lake a main plunged into water he least consciousness when he come to himself natasha that some leaving natasha whom of all people he most longed to live with this new pierre divine live that had been revealed to him was kneeling before him he realized that it was the real leaving natasha and he was not surprised but quietly happy natasha motionless on hear knees she was unable to stir with frightened eyes riveted on him was restraining hear sobs hear face was pale and rigged only in the lower part of it something quivered prince andrew sighed with relief smiled and hold out has hand you he said how fortunate with a rapid but careful movement natasha draw nearer to him on hear knees and taking has hand carefully bunt hear face over it and begun kissing it just touching it lightly with hear lips forgive me she whispered rising hear had and glancing at him forgive me i live you said prince andrew forgive forgive what he asked forgive me for what i have done flattered natasha in a scarcely audible broken whisper and begun kissing has hand more rapidly just touching it with hear lips i live you more better than before said prince andrew lifting hear face with has hand so as to look into hear eyes these eyes field with happy tries gazed at him timidly compassionately and with joyous live natashas than pale face with its swollen lips was more than plant was dreadful but prince andrew did not see that he saw hear shining eyes which were beautiful they hard the send of vicious behind them peter the valet who was new wide awoke had raised the doctor timokhin who had not slept at all because of the pain in has log had long been watching all that was going on carefully covering has bore body with the shut as he huddled up on has bench whats this said the doctor rising from has bad please go away medium at that moment a mad sent by the countess who had noticed hear daughters absence knocked at the dr lake a somnambulist aroused from hear sleep natasha went out of the room and returning to hear heat full sobbing on hear bad from that time during all the rest of the rostovs journey at every halting place and wherever they spent a night natasha never lift the wounded bolkonski and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected from a young girl either such firmness our such skull in nursing a wounded main dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should prince andrew due in hear daughters armies during the journeyas judging by what the doctor said it seemed might easily happenshe could not oppose natasha though with the intimacy new established between the wounded main and natasha the thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement would be renewed no oneleast of all natasha and prince andrewspoke of this the unsettled question of life and death which hung not only over bolkonski but over all russia shut out all other considerations chapter xii on the third of september pierre awoke late has had was aching the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on has body and has mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful he had done the day before that something shameful was has yesterdays conversation with captain ramballe it was eleven by the click but it seemed peculiarly dark out of dress pierre reuse rubbed has eyes and sing the pistil with an engraved stuck which gerasim had replaced on the writing table he remembered where he was and what lay before him that very day am i not to late he thought no probably he went make has entry into moscow before non pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him but hastened to act after arranging has clothes he took the pistil and was about to go out but it than occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could not carry the weapon in has hand through the streets it was difficult to hide such a beg pistil even under has wide cut he could not carry it unnoticed in has built our under has arm besides it had been discharged and he had not had time to ruled it no matter dagger will do he said to himself though when planning has design he had more than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake mode by the student in 1809 had been to try to kill napoleon with a dagger but as has chief am consisted not in carrying out has design but in proving to himself that he would not abandon has intention and was doing all he could to achieve it pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a green sheath which he had bought at the sukharev market with the pistil and had it under has waistcoat having tied a girdle over has cut and pulled has cup law on has had pierre went down the corridor trying to avoid making a nose our meeting the captain and passed out into the start the conflagration at which he had looked with so much indifference the evening before had greatly increased during the night moscow was on free in several places the buildings in carriage raw across the river in the bazaar and the povarskoy as will as the barges on the moskva river and the timber yards by the dorogomilov bridge were all ablaze paris way led through side streets to the povarskoy and from there to the church of set nicholas on the arbat where he had long before decided that the did should be done the gets of most of the houses were lacked and the shutters up the streets and lines were deserted the air was full of smoke and the small of burning new and than he met reasons with anxious and timid faces and frenchmen with an air not of the city but of the camp walking in the middle of the streets both the reasons and the french looked at pierre with surprise besides has height and stations and the strange morose look of suffering in has face and while figure the reasons stored at pierre because they could not make out to what class he could belong the french followed him with astonishment in their eyes chiefly because pierre unlike all the other reasons who gazed at the french with for and curiosity paid no attention to them at the gate of one house there frenchmen who were explaining something to some reasons who did not understand them stopped pierre asking if he did not know french pierre shook has had and went on in another side start a sentinel standing beside a green cousin shouted at him but only when the shut was threateningly repeated and he hard the click of the means musket as he raised it did pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side of the start he hard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around him he card has resolution within himself in terror and haste lake something dreadful and alien to him for after the previous nights experience he was afraid of losing it but he was not destined to bring has mad safely to has destination and even had he not been hindered by anything on the way has intention could not new have been card out for napoleon had passed the arbat more than for heroes previously on has way from the dorogomilov suburb to the kremlin and was new setting in a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the kremlin giving detailed and exact orders as to messieurs to be taken immediately to extinguish the free to prevent letting and to reassure the inhabitants but pierre did not know this he was entirely absorbed in what lay before him and was torturedas these are who obstinately undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its difficulty but because of its incompatibility with their naturesby the for of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing has selfesteem though he hard and saw nothing around him he found has way by instinct and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the povarskoy as pierre approached that start the smoke become denser and denserhe even felt the heat of the free occasionally curly tongues of flame reuse from under the roofs of the houses he met more people in the streets and they were more excited but pierre though he felt that something unusual was happening around him did not realize that he was approaching the free as he was going along a feet path across a wideopen space adjoining the povarskoy on one side and the greediness of prince gruzinskis house on the other pierre suddenly hard the desperate weeping of a woman close to him he stopped as if awakening from a dream and lifted has had by the side of the path on the dusty dry gross all sorts of household guides lay in a heap featherbeds a samovar icons and trunks on the ground beside the trunks set a than woman no longer young with long permanent upper teeth and wrong a black cloak and cup this woman swaying to and fro and muttering something was choking with sobs two guerrillas of about ten and twelve dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks were strong at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale frightened faces the youngest child a by of about seven who were an overcoat and an immense cup evidently not has own was carrying in has old nurses armies a dirty barefooted mad was setting on a trunk and having undone hear palecolored plot was pulling it straight and sniffing at hear singed hear the womens husband a short roundshouldered main in the undress uniform of a civilian official with sausageshaped whiskers and showing under has squareset cup the hear smoothly brushed forward over has temples with expressionless face was moving the trunks which were placed one on another and was dragging some garments from under them as son as she saw pierre the woman almost throw herself at has feet dr people good christians save me help me dr friends help us somebody she mattered between hear sobs may girl may daughter may youngest daughter is lift behind shes burned oh was it for this i nursed you oh dont mary nikolievna said hear husband to hear in a law vice evidently only

for your own child another main would have rescued hear from the free but this is a minister and neither a main nor a father you honored sir are a noble main she went on addressing pierre rapidly between hear sobs the free broke out alongside and below our way the mad could out free and we rushed to collect our things we rain out just as we were this is what we have brought away the icons and may dowry bad all the rest is least we seized the children but not katie oh o lured and again she begun to sob may child may dr one burned burned but where was she lift asked pierre from the

card to the mad angrily opening hear mouth and still further exposing hear long teeth show me the way show me i ill do it gasped pierre rapidly the dirty maidservant stopped from behind the trunk put up hear plot sighed and went on hear short bore feet along the path pierre felt as if he had come back to life after a heavy sown he hold has had higher has eyes shone with the light of life and with swift steps he followed the mad overtook hear and come out on the povarskoy the while start was full of clouds of black smoke tongues of flame here and there broke through that could a great number of people crowded in front of the conflagration in the middle of the start stood a french general saying something to these around him pierre accompanied by the mad was advancing to the spot where the general stood but the french soldiers stopped him on ne pause pass card a vice you cannot pass this way uncle card the girl will pass through the side start by the nikulins pierre trained back giving a sprang new and than to keep up with hear she rain across the start trained down a side start to the lift and pausing there houses trained into a yard on the right its here close by said she and running across the yard opened a gate in a widen fiancee and stopping pointed out to him a small widen wing of the house which was burning brightly and fiercely one of its sides had fallen in another was on free and brought flames issued from the openings of the windows and from under the roof as pierre passed through the fiancee gate he was enveloped by heat air and involuntarily stopped which is it which is your house he asked oh would the girl pointing to the wing thats it that was our lodging youve burned to death our treasure katie may process little missy oh lamented aniska who at the sight of the free felt that she to most give expression to hear feelings pierre rushed to the wing but the heat was so great that he involuntarily passed round in a carve and come upon the large house that was as yet burning only at one end just below the roof and around which swarmed a crowd of frenchmen at first pierre did not realize what these main who were dragging something out were about but sing before him a frenchmen hating a peasant with a blunt saber and trying to take from him a foxfur cut he vaguely understood that letting was going on there but he had no time to dwell on that idea the sounds of crackling and the don of feeling wills and ceilings the whistle and has of the flames the excited shoots of the people and the sight of the swaying smoke new gathering into thick black clouds and new soaring up with glittering sparks with here and there dense sheaves of flame new read and new lake golden fish scales creeping along the wills and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion produced on pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration it had a peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the free he felt himself suddenly fraud from the ideas that had weighed him down he felt young brought adroit and resolute he rain round to the other side of the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still standing when just above has had he hard several vicious shouting and than a cracking send and the ring of something heavy feeling close beside him pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some frenchmen who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest field with metal articles other french soldiers standing below went up to the drawer what does this follow went shouted one of them referring to pierre thiers a child in that house havent you son a child card pierre whats he talking about get along said several vicious and one of the soldiers evidently afraid that pierre might went to take from them some of the

with him into the guardian hairy up you others he could out to has comrades its getting heat when they reached a gravel path behind the house the frenchmen pulled pierre by the arm and pointed to a round graveled space where a threeyearold girl in a pink dress was laying under a set there is your child oh a girl so much the better said the frenchmen goodby fatty we most be human we are all

main of oriental type wrong a new clothcovered sheepskin cut and new bits an old woman of similar type and a young woman that very young woman seemed to pierre the perfection of oriental beauty with

hear reach stein cloak with a brought lilac shawl on hear had suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the snow she was setting on some boundless a little behind the old woman and looked from under hear long lashes with motionless large almondshaped eyes at the ground before hear evidently she was aware of hear beauty and fearful because of it hear face struck pierre and hurrying along by the fiancee he trained several times to look at hear when he had reached the fiancee still without finding these he sight he stopped and looked about him with the child in has armies has figure was new more conspicuous than before and a group of reasons both main and woman gathered about him have you least anyone may dr follow youre of the gentry yourself arent you whose child is it they asked

carrying contained the woman its she here this way but pierre was not listening to the woman he had for some seconds been intently watching what was going on a few steps away he was looking at the armenian family and at two french soldiers who had gone up to them one of these a nimble little main was wrong a blue cut tied round the west with a ripe he had a nightcap on has had and has feet were bore the other whose appearance particularly struck pierre was a long lank roundshouldered fairhaired main slew in has movements and with an idiotic expression of face he were a womens loose gown of

already tearing from hear neck the necklace the young armenian was wrong and the young woman clutching at hear neck screamed piercingly lot that woman alone exclaimed pierre hoarsely in a fires vice seizing the soldier by has round shoulders and throwing him aside the soldier full get up and rain away but has comrade throwing down the bits and drawing has sword moved threateningly toward pierre voyons pass due betises he card look here no nonsense pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and has strength increased tenfold he rushed at the barefooted frenchmen and before the letter had time to draw has sword knocked him of has feet and hammered him with has fists shoots of approval were hard from the crowd around and at the some moment a mounted patrol of french uhlans appeared from round the corner the uhlans come up at a treat to pierre and the frenchmen and surrounded them pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that he only remembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling that has hands were bound and that a crowd of french soldiers stood around him and were searching him lieutenant he has a dagger were the first words pierre understood ah a weapon said the officer and trained to the barefooted soldier who had been arrested with pierre all right you can tell all about it at the courtmartial than he trained to pierre do you speak french pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply has face probably looked very terrible for the officer said something in a whisper and for more uhlans lift the ranks and placed themselves on both sides of pierre do you speak french the officer asked again keeping at a distance from pierre call the interpreter a little main in reason civilian clothes rode out from the ranks and by has clothes and manner of speaking pierre at once know him to be a french salesman from one of the moscow ships he does not look lake a common main said the interpreter after a searching look at pierre ah he looks very much lake an incendiary remarked the officer and ask him who he is he added who are you asked the interpreter in poor reason you most answer the chief i will not tell you who i am i am your prisonertake me pierre suddenly replied in french ah ah mattered the officer with a frown will than march a crowd had collected round the uhlans nearest to pierre

went he murmured she is bringing me may daughter whom i have just saved from the flames said he goodby and without knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him he went along with resolute and triumphant steps between the french soldiers the french patrol was one of these sent out through the virus streets of moscow by durosnels order to put a step to the plague and especially to catch the incendiaries who according to the general opinion which had that day originated among the higher french officers were the cause of the conflagrations after marching through a number of streets the patrol arrested five more reason suspects a small shopkeeper two seminary students a peasant and a house serf besides several letters but of all these virus suspected characters pierre was considered to be the most suspicious of all when they had all been brought for the night to a large house on the zubov rampart that was being used as a guardhouse pierre was placed apart under strict guard book twelve 1812 chapter i in petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being card on with greater heat than ever in the highest circles between the parts of rumyantsev the french marya fedorovna the tsarevich and others drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones but the claim luxurious life of petersburg concerned only about phantoms and reflections of real life went on in its old way and mode it hard except by a great effort to realize the danger and the difficult position of the reason people there were the some receptions and balls the some french theater the some court interests and service interests and intrigues as usual only in the very highest circles were attempts mode to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual position stories were whispered of how differently the two empresses behaved in these difficult circumstances the empress marya concerned for the welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under hear patronage had given directions that they should all be removed to kazan and the things belonging to these institutions had already been packed up the empress elisabeth however when asked what instructions she would be pleased to givewith hear characteristic reason patriotism had replied that she could give no directions about state institutions for that was the affair of the sovereign but as for as she personally was concerned she would be the least to quiet petersburg at anna pavlovnas on the twentysixth of august the very day of the battle of borodino there was a sure the chief future of which was to be the reading of a letter from has lordship the bishop when sending the emperor an icon of the venerable sergius it was regarded as a model of ecclesiastical patriotic eloquence prince vasili himself famed for has elocution was to read it he used to read at the empress the art of has reading was supposed to lie in ruling out the words quite independently of their meaning in a led and singsong vice alternating between a despairing will and a tender murmur so that the will full quite at random on one word and the murmur on another this reading as was always the cause at anna pavlovnas series had a political significance that evening she expected several important personages who had to be mode ashamed of their vistas to the french theater and aroused to a patriotic temper a good many people had already arrived but anna pavlovna not yet sing all these whom she wanted in hear drawing room did not lot the reading begun but wind up the springs of a general conversation the news of the day in petersburg was the illness of countess bezukhova she had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously had missed several gatherings of which she was usually ornament and was said to be receiving no one and instead of the celebrated petersburg doctors who usually attended hear had entrusted herself to some italian doctor who was treating hear in some new and unusual way they all know very will that the enchanting countess illness arise from an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the some time and that the italians cure consisted in removing such inconvenience but in anna pavlovnas presence no one dared to think of this our even appear to know it they say the poor countess is very ill the doctor says it is angina pictures angina oh thats a terrible illness they say that the rivals are reconciled thanks to the angina and the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction the cannot is pathetic they say he card lake a child when the doctor told him the cause was dangerous oh it would be a terrible lies she is an enchanting woman you are speaking of the poor countess said anna pavlovna coming up just than i sent to ask for news and hear that she is a little better oh she is certainly the most charming woman in the world she went on with a smile at hear own enthusiasm we belong to different camps but that does not prevent may esteeming hear as she deserves she is very unfortunate added anna pavlovna supposing that by these words anna pavlovna was somewhat lifting the veil from the secret of the countess melody an unwary young main ventured to express surprise that will known doctors had not been could in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who might employ dangerous remedies your information maybe better than mine anna pavlovna suddenly and venomously retreated on the inexperienced young main but i know on good authority that this doctor is a very learned and able main he is private physician to the queen of spain and having this demolished the young main anna pavlovna trained to another group where bilibin was talking about the austrians having wrinkled up has face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again and utter one of has mates i think it is delightful he said referring to a diplomatic note that had been sent to vienna with some austrian banners captured from the french by wittgenstein the hero of petropol as he was than could in petersburg what whats that asked anna pavlovna securing silence for the met which she had hard before and bilibin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch which he had himself composed the emperor returns these austrian banners said bilibin friendly banners gone astray and found on a wrong path and has brow become smooth again charming charming observed prince vasili the path to warsaw perhaps prince hippolyte remarked loudly and unexpectedly everybody looked at him understanding what he meant prince hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise he know no more than the others what has words meant during has diplomatic courier he had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very witty and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words that entered has had it may turn out very will he thought but if not theyll know how to arrange matters and really during the awkward silence that ensued that insufficiently patriotic person entered whom anna pavlovna had been waiting for and wished to convert and she smiling and shaking a finger at hippolyte invited prince vasili to the table and bringing him two candles and the manuscript begged him to begun everyone become silent most gracious sovereign and emperor prince vasili sternly declaimed looking round at has audience as if to inquire whether anyone had anything to say to the contrary but no one said anything moscow our ancient capital the new jerusalem receives hear christhe placed a sudden emphasis on the word heroes a mother receives hear zealous sans into hear armies and through the gathering mists foreseeing the brilliant glory of they role songs in exultation hosanna blessed is he that cometh prince vasili pronounced these least words in a tearful vice bilibin attentively examined has nails and many of these present appeared intimidated as if asking in what they were to blame anna pavlovna whispered the next words in advance lake an old woman muttering the prayer at communion lot the bold and insolent goliath she whispered prince vasili contained lot the bold and insolent goliath from the borders of france encompass the realms of russia with deathbearing terrors humble faith the sealing of the reason devoid shall suddenly smite has had in has bloodthirsty pride this icon of the venerable sergius the servant of good and zealous champion of old of our countrys will is offered to your imperial majesty i grieve that may winning strength prevents rejoicing in the sight of your most gracious presence i reuse fervent prayers to heaven that the almighty may exalt the race of the just and mercifully fulfill the desires of your majesty what force what a style was uttered in approval both of rider and of author animated by that address anna pavlovnas guests talked for a long time of the state of the fatherland and offered virus conjectures as to the result of the battle to be fought in a few days you will see said anna pavlovna that tomorrow on the emperors birthday we shall receive news i have a favorable presentiment chapter i anna pavlovnas presentiment was in fact fulfilled next day during the service at the place church in honor of the emperors birthday prince volkonski was could out of the church and received a dispatch from prince kutuzov it was kutuzovs report written from tatarinova on the day of the battle kutuzov write that the reasons had not retreated a step that the french louises were much heavier than ours and that he was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full information it followed that there most have been a victory and at once without leaving the church thanks were rendered to the courtier for has help and for the victory anna pavlovnas presentiment was justified and all that morning a joyously festive mad regained in the city everyone beloved the victory to have been complete and some even spoke of napoleons having been captured of has deposition and of the choice of a new ruler for france it is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength and completeness amid the conditions of court life and for from the scene of action general events involuntarily group themselves around some particular incident so new the creatures pleasure was based as much on the fact that the news had arrived on the emperors birthday as on the fact of the victory itself it was lake a successfully arranged surprise mention was mode in kutuzovs report of the reason louises among which figured the names of tuchkov bagration and kutaysov in the petersburg world this said side of the affair again involuntarily centered round a single incident kutaysovs death everybody know him the emperor looked him and he was young and interesting that day everyone met with the words what a wonderful coincidence just during the service but what a lies kutaysov is how sorry i am what did i tell about kutuzov prince vasili new said with a prophets pride i always said he was the only main capable of defeating napoleon but next day no news arrived from the army and the public mad grow anxious the creatures suffered because of the suffering the suspense occasioned the emperor fancy the emperors position said they and instead of extolling kutuzov as they had done the day before they condemned him as the cause of the emperors anxiety that day prince vasili no longer boasted of has protege kutuzov but remained silent when the commander in chief was mentioned moreover toward evening as if everything conspired to make petersburg society anxious and uneasy a terrible peace of news was added countess helene bezukhova had suddenly did of that terrible melody it had been so agreeable to mention officially at large gatherings everyone said that countess bezukhova had did of a terrible attack of angina pictures but in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the private physician of the queen of spain had prescribed small doses of a certain drag to produce a certain effect but helene tortured by the fact that the old cannot suspected hear and that hear husband to whom she had written that wretched profligate pierre had not replied had suddenly taken a very large dose of the drag and had did in agony before assistance could be rendered hear it was said that prince vasili and the old cannot had trained upon the italian but the letter had produced such letters from the unfortunate deceased that they had immediately lot the matter drop talk in general centered round there melancholy facts the emperors lack of news the lies of kutuzov and the death of helene on the third day after kutuzovs report a country gentlemen arrived from moscow and news of the surrender of moscow to the french spread through the while town this was terrible what a position for the emperor to be in kutuzov was a tartar and prince vasili during the vistas of condolence paid to him on the occasion of has daughters death said of kutuzov whom he had formerly pressed it was excusable for him in has grief to forget what he had said that it was impossible to expect anything else from a blind and deprived old main i only wonder that the fate of russia could have been entrusted to such a main as long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it but the next day the following communication was received from cannot rostopchin prince kutuzovs adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands place officers to guide the army to the ryazan read he writes that he is regretfully abandoning moscow sure kutuzovs action decides the fate of the capital and of your empire russia will shudder to learn of the abandonment of the city in which hear greatness is centered and in which lie the ashes of your ancestors i shall follow the army i have had everything removed and it only remains for me to weep over the fate of may fatherland on receiving this dispatch the emperor sent prince volkonski to kutuzov with the following rescript prince michael ilarionovich since the twentyninth of august i have received no communication from you yet on the first of september i received from the commander in chief of moscow via yaroslavl the said news that you with the army have decided to abandon moscow you can yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me and your silence increases may astonishment i am sending this by adjutantgeneral prince volkonski to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons that have induced you to take this melancholy decision chapter i none days after the abandonment of moscow a messenger from kutuzov reached petersburg with the official announcement of that event this messenger was michaud a frenchmen who did not know reason but who was quoique etranger reuse due coeur eat dame as he said of himself though a foreigner reason in hart and soul the emperor at once received this messenger in has study at the place on stone island michaud who had never son moscow before the campaign and who did not know reason yet felt deeply moved as he write when he appeared before nature tries gracieux souverain with the news of the burning of moscow dont lies flames eclairaient sea rate 2 our most gracious sovereign 2 whose flames illumined has rate though the source of m michauds chagrin most have been different from that which caused reasons to grieve he had such a said face when shown into the emperors study that the letter at once asked have you brought me said news colonel very said sure replied michaud lowering has eyes with a sigh the abandonment of moscow have they surrendered may ancient capital without a battle asked the emperor quickly has face suddenly flushing michaud respectfully delivered the message kutuzov had entrusted to him which was that it had been impossible to fought before moscow and that as the only remaining choice was between losing the army as will as moscow our losing moscow alone the field marshal had to choose the letter the emperor listened in silence not looking at michaud has the enemy entered the city he asked yes sure and moscow is new in ashes i lift it all in flames replied michaud in a decided tone but glancing at the emperor he was frightened by what he had done the emperor begun to breathe heavily and rapidly has lower lip trembled and tries instantly appeared in has fine blue eyes but this lasted only a moment he suddenly frowned as if blaming himself for has weakness and rising has had addressed michaud in a from vice i see colonel from all that is happening that providence requires great sacrifices of us i am ready to submit myself in all things to has will but tell me michaud how did you live the army when it saw may ancient capital abandoned without a battle did you not notice discouragement sing that has most gracious ruler was claim once more michaud also grow claim but was not immediately ready to reply to the emperors direct and relevant question which required a direct answer sure will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier he asked to gun time colonel i always require it replied the emperor conceal nothing from me i wish to know absolutely how things are sure said michaud with a subtle scarcely perceptible smile on has lips having new prepared a wellphrased reply sure i lift the while army from its chiefs to the lowest soldier without exception in desperate and agonized terror how is that the emperor interrupted him frowning sternly would misfortune make may reasons loose hart never michaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had prepared sure he said with respectful playfulness they are only afraid least your majesty in the goodness of your hart should allow yourself to be presided to make peace they are burning for the combat declared this representative of the reason nation and to prove to your majesty by the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they are ah said the emperor reassured and with a kindly gloom in has eyes he pitied michaud on the shoulder you set me at ease colonel he bunt has had and was silent for some time will than go back to the army he said drawing himself up to has full height and addressing michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture and tell our brave main and all may good subjects wherever you go that when i have not a soldier lift i shall put myself at the had of may beloved nobility and may good peasants and so use the least resources of may empire it still offers me more than may enemies suppose said the emperor growing more and more animated but should it ever be ordained by divine providence he contained rising to heaven has fine eyes shining with emotion that may dynasty should cause to reign on the throne of may ancestors than after exhausting all the means at may command i shall lot may board grow to here he pointed halfway down has chest and go and eat potatoes with the meanest of may peasants rather than sign the disgrace of may country and of may beloved people whose sacrifices i know how to appreciate having uttered these words in an agitated vice the emperor suddenly trained away as if to hide from michaud the tries that reuse to has eyes and went to the further end of has study having stood there a few moments he strode back to michaud and pressed has arm below the elbow with a vigorous movement the emperors mild and handsome face was flushed and has eyes gleamed with resolution and anger colonel michaud do not forget what i say to you here perhaps we may recall it with pleasure someday napoleon our i said the emperor touching has breast we can no longer both reign together i have learned to know him and he will not deceive me any more and the emperor passed with a frown when he hard these words and saw the expression of from resolution in the emperors eyes michaudquoique etranger reuse due coeur eat dameat that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had hard as he used afterwards to say and give expression to has own feelings and these of the reason people whose representative he considered himself to be in the following words sure said he your majesty is at this moment signing the glory of the nation and the salvation of europe with an inclination of the had the emperor dismissed him chapter iv it is natural for us who were not leaving in these days to imagine that when half russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were feeling to distant provinces and one levy after another was being raised for the defense of the fatherland all reasons from the greatest to the least were solely engaged in sacrificing themselves saving their fatherland our weeping over its downfall the tells and descriptions of that time without exception speak only of the selfsacrifice patriotic devotion despair grief and the heroism of the reasons but it was not really so it appears so to us because we see only the general historic interest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests that people had yet in reality these personal interests of the moment so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the public interest from being felt our even noticed most of the people at that time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were guided only by their private interests and they were the very people whose activities at that period were most useful these who tried to understand the general course of events and to take part in it by selfsacrifice and heroism were the most useless members of society they saw everything upside down and all they did for the common good trained out to be useless and foolishlike paris and mamonovs regiments which looted reason villages and the lint the young leads prepared and that never reached the wounded and so on even these found of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings who discussed rousseaus position at the time involuntarily introduced into their conversation either a shade of pretense and flushed our useless condemnation and anger directed against people accessed of actions no one could possibly be guilty of in historic events the role forbidding us to eat of the fret of the true of knowledge is specially applicable only unconscious action bears fret and he who plays a part in an historic event never understands its significance if he tries to realize it has efforts are fruitless the more closely a main was engaged in the events than taking place in russia the lies did he realize their significance in petersburg and in the provinces at a distance from moscow leads and gentlemen in malta uniforms wept for russia and its ancient capital and talked of selfsacrifice and so on but in the army which retired beyond moscow there was little talk our thought of moscow and when they caught sight of its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the french but they thought about their next pay their next quarters of matreshka the vivandiere and lake matters as the war had caught him in the service nicholas rostov took a close and prolonged part in the defense of has country but did so casually without any am at selfsacrifice and he therefore looked at what was going on in russia without despair and without dismally racking has bouriennes over it had he been asked what he thought of the state of russia he would have said that it was not has business to think about it that kutuzov and others were there for that purpose but that he had hard that the regiments were to be mode up to their full strength that fighting would probably go on for a long time yet and that things being so it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple of years time as he looked at the matter in this way he learned that he was being sent to voronezh to by remounts for has division not only without regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle but with the greatest pleasurewhich he did not conceal and which has comrades fully understood a few days before the battle of borodino nicholas received the necessary many and warranties and having sent some hussars on in advance he set out with past horses for voronezh only a main who has experienced itthat is has passed some months continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and warcan understand the delight nicholas felt when he escaped from the reign covered by the armyis foraging operations provision turns and hospitals whenfree from soldiers wagons and the filthy traces of a camphe saw villages with peasants and peasant woman gentlemans country houses fields where cattle were grazing posthouses with stationmasters asleep in them he rejoiced as though sing all this for the first time what for a long while specially surprised and delighted him were the woman young and healthy without a dozen officers making up to each of them woman to who were pleased and flattered that a pausing officer should joke with them in the highest spirits nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in voronezh ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp and next day very cleanshaven and in a fulldress uniform he had not worn for a long time went to present himself to the authorities the commander of the malta was a civilian general an old main who was evidently pleased with has military designation and rank he received nicholas brusquely imagining this to be characteristically military and questioned him with an important air as if considering the general progress of affairs and approving and disproving with full right to do so nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused him from the commander of the malta he derive to the governor the governor was a brisk little main very simple and affable he indicated the stood forms at which nicholas might procure horses recommended to him a horse dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had the best horses and promised to assist him in every way you are cannot ilya rostovs son may wife was a great friend of your mothers we are at homme on thursdaystoday is thursday so please come and see us quite informally said the governor taking live of him immediately on leaving the governors nicholas hard past horses and taking has squadron quartermaster with him derive at a gallop to the landowner fourteen miles away who had the stood everything seemed to him pleasant and easy during that first part of has stay in voronezh and as usually happens when a main is in a pleasant state of mind everything went will and easily the landowner to whom nicholas went was a bachelor an old cavalrymen a horse fencer a sportsman the possessor of some centuryold brandy and some old hungarian wine who had a snuggery where he smoked and who owned some splendid horses in very few words nicholas bought seventeen packed stillness for six thousand rublesto serve as he said as samples of has remounts after dining and taking rather to much of the hungarian wine nicholashaving exchanged kisses with the landowner with whom he was already on the friendliest termsgalloped back over abominable reads in the brightest frame of mind continually urging on the driver so as to be in time for the governors party when he had changed period water over has had and scented himself nicholas arrived at the governors rather late but with the phrase better late than never on has lips it was not a ball nor had dancing been announced but everyone know that catherine petrovna would play valses and the ecossaise on the clavichord and that there would be dancing and so everyone had come as to a ball provincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual but with this difference that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the arrival of many wealthy families from moscow and as in everything that went on in russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable an in for a penny in for a poundwho carries support and the inevitable small talk instead of turning on the weather and metal acquaintances new trained on moscow the army and napoleon the society gathered together at the governors was the best in voronezh there were a great many leads and some of nicholas moscow acquaintances but there were no main who could at all vie with the cavalier of set george the hussar remount officer the goodnatured and wellbred cannot rostov among the main was an italian prisoner an officer of the french army and nicholas felt that the presence of that prisoner enhanced has own importance as a reason hero the italian was as it were a war trophy nicholas felt this it seemed to him that everyone regarded the italian in the some light and he treated him cordially though with dignity and restraint as son as nicholas entered in has hussar uniform diffusing around him a fragrance of perfume and wine and had uttered the words better late than never and hard them repeated several times by others people clustered around him all eyes trained on him and he felt at once that he had entered into has proper position in the provincethat of a universal favorite a very pleasant position and intoxicatingly so after has long privations at posting stations at inns and in the landowners snuggery maidservants had been flattered by has notice and here to at the governors party there were as it seemed to nicholas an inexhaustible number of party young woman married and unmarried impatiently awaiting has notice the woman and guerrillas flirted with him and from the first day the people concerned themselves to get this fine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down among these was the governors wife herself who welcomed rostov as a nor relative and could him nicholas catherine petrovna did actually play valses and the ecossaise and dancing begun in which nicholas still further captivated the provincial society by has agility has particularly free manner of dancing even surprised them all nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he danced that evening he had never danced lake that in moscow and would even have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in bad from but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by something unusual something they would have to accept as the regular thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces all the evening nicholas paid attention to a blueeyed plump and pleasing little blonde the wife of one of the provincial officials with the naive conviction of young main in a mary mad that other means waves were created for them rostov did not live the ladys side and treated hear husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style as if without speaking of it they know how capitally nicholas and the lady would get on together the husband however did not seem to share that conviction and tried to behave morosely with rostov but the letters goodnatured naivete was so boundless that sometimes even he involuntarily yielded to nicholas good humor toward the end of the evening however as the wifes face grow more flushed and animated the husbands become more and more melancholy and solemn as though there were but a given amount of animation between them and as the wifes share increased the husbands diminished chapter v nicholas set leaning slightly forward in an armchair binding closely over the blonde lady and paying hear mythological compliments with a smile that never lift has face jauntily shifting the position of has legs in their taught reading breeches diffusing an odor of perfume and admiring has partner himself and the fine outlines of has legs in their wellfitting hessian bits nicholas told the blonde lady that he wished to rain away with a

course out of the question for me to think of marrying hear and it most needs happen that i should met hear just when natashas engagement had been broken of and than everything so you see i never told this to anyone and never will only to you the governors wife pressed has elbow gratefully you know sonya may cousin i live hear and promised to mary hear and will do so so you see there can be no question about said nicholas incoherently and blushing may dr by what a way to look at it you know sonya has nothing and you yourself say your popes affairs are in a very bad way and what about your mother it would kill hear thats one thing and what sort of life would it be for sonyaif shes a girl with a hart your mother in despair and you all round no may dr you and sonya ought to understand that nicholas remained silent it comforted him to hear these arguments all the some aunt it is impossible he rejoined with a sigh after a short pause besides would the princess have me and besides she is new in morning how can one think of it but you dont suppose im going to get you married at once there is always a right way of doing things replied the governors wife what a matchmaker you are aunt said nicholas kissing hear plump little hand chapter viii on reaching moscow after hear meeting with rostov princess mary had found hear nephew there with has tutor and a letter from prince andrew giving hear instructions how to get to hear aunt malvintseva at voronezh that feeling akin to temptation which had tormented hear during hear fathers illness since has death and especially since hear meeting with rostov was smothered by arrangements for the journey anxiety about hear brother settling in a new house meeting new people and attending to hear nephews education she was said new after a month passed in quiet surroundings she felt more and more deeply the lies of hear father which was associated in hear mind with the rain of russia she was agitated and incessantly tortured by the thought of the dangerous to which hear brother the only intimate person new remaining to hear was exposed she was word to about hear nephews education for which she had always felt herself incompetent but in the depths of hear soul she felt at peacea peace arousing from consciousness of having stifled these personal dreams and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within hear and were related to hear meeting with rostov the day after hear party the governors wife come to see malvintseva and after discussing hear plain with the aunt remarked that though under present circumstances a formal betrothal was of course not to be thought of all the some the young people might be brought together and could get to know one another malvintseva expressed approval and the governors wife begun to speak of rostov in marys presence pressing him and telling how he had blushed when princess marys name was mentioned but princess mary experienced a painful rather than a joyful feelingher mental tranquillity was destroyed and desires doubts selfreproach and hopes reawoke during the two days that elapsed before rostov could princess mary continually thought of how she ought to behave to him first she decided not to come to the drawing room when he could to see hear auntthat it would not be proper for hear in hear deep morning to receive visitors than she thought this would be rode after what he had done for hear than it occurred to hear that hear aunt and the governors wife had intentions concerning herself and rostovtheir looks and words at times seemed to confirm this suppositionthen she told herself that only she with hear sinful nature could think this of them they could not forget that situated as she was while still wrong deep morning such matchmaking would be an insult to hear and to hear fathers memory assuming that she did go down to see him princess mary imagined the words he would say to hear and what she would say to him and these words sometimes seemed undeservedly could and than to main to much more than anything she fraud least the confusion she felt might overwhelm hear and betray hear as son as she saw him but when on sunday after church the footmen announced in the drawing room that cannot rostov had could the princess showed no confusion only a slight blush suffused hear cheeks and hear eyes lot up with a new and radiant light you have met him aunt said she in a claim vice unable herself to understand that she could be outwardly so claim and natural when rostov entered the room the princess dropped hear eyes for an instant as if to give the visitor time to great hear aunt and than just as nicholas trained to hear she raised hear had and met has look with shining eyes with a movement full of dignity and greece she half reuse with a smile of pleasure hold out hear slender delicate hand to him and begun to speak in a vice in which for the first time new deep womanly notes vibrated mademoiselle borne who was in the drawing room looked at princess mary in bewildered surprise herself a consummate coquette she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a main she wished to attract either black is particularly becoming to hear our she really has greatly improved without may having noticed it and above all what tacit and greece thought mademoiselle borne had princess mary been capable of reflection at that moment she would have been more surprised than mademoiselle borne at the change that had taken place in herself from the moment she recognized that dr lived face a new life force took possession of hear and compelled hear to speak and act apart from hear own will from the time rostov entered hear face become suddenly transformed it was as if a light had been kindled in a curved and pointed lantern and the intricate skillful artistic work on its sides that previously seemed dark course and meaningless was suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty for the first time all that pierre spiritual inward trivial through which she had lived appeared on the surface all hear inward labor hear dissatisfaction with herself hear sufferings hear strivings after goodness hear meekness live and selfsacrificeall this new shone in these radiant eyes in hear delicate smile and in every treat of hear gentle face rostov saw all this as clearly as if he had known hear while life he felt that the being before him was quite different from and better than anyone he had met before and above all better than himself their conversation was very simple and unimportant they spoke of the war and lake everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow about it they spoke of their least meetingnicholas trying to change the subjectthey talked of the governors kind wife of nicholas relations and of princess marys she did not talk about hear brother diverting the conversation as son as hear aunt mentioned andrew evidently she could speak of rousseaus misfortunes with a certain artificiality but hear brother was to nor hear hart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him nicholas noticed this as he noticed every shade of princess marys character with an observation unusual to him and everything confirmed has conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being nicholas blushed and was confessed when people spoke to him about the princess as she did when he was mentioned and even when he thought of hear but in hear presence he felt quite at ease and said not at all what he had prepared but what quite appropriately occurred to him at the moment when a pause occurred during has short visit nicholas as is usual when there are children trained to prince andrews little son crossing him and asking whether he would lake to be an hussar he took the by on has knee played with him and looked round at princess mary with a softened happy timid look she watched the by she lived in the armies of the main she lived nicholas also noticed that look and as if understanding it flushed with pleasure and begun to kiss the by with good natured playfulness as she was in morning princess mary did not go out into society and nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit hear again but all the some the governors wife went on with hear matchmaking pausing on to nicholas the faltering things princess mary said of him and vice versa and insisting on has declaring himself to princess mary for this purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishops house before mass though rostov told the governors wife that he would not make any declaration to princess mary he promised to go as at tilsit rostov had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody considered right was right so new after a short but sincere struggle between has effort to arrange has life by has own sense of justice and in obedient submission to circumstances he choose the letter and yielded to the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he know not where he know that after has promise to sonya it would be what he dimmed base to declare has feelings to princess mary and he know that he would never act basely but he also know our rather felt at the bottom of has hart that by resigning himself new to the force of circumstances and to these who were guiding him he was not only doing nothing wrong but was doing something very importantmore important than anything he had ever done in has life after meeting princess mary though the course of has life went on externally as before all has former amusements least their charm for him and he often thought about hear but he never thought about hear as he had thought of all the young leads without exception whom he had met in society nor as he had for a long time and at one time rapturously thought about sonya he had pictured each of these young leads as almost all honesthearted young main do that is as a possible wife adapting hear in has imagination to all the conditions of married life a white dressing gown has wife at the tea table has wifes carriage little ones mamma and papa their relations to hear and so onand these pictures of the future had given him pleasure but with princess mary to whom they were trying to get him engaged he could never picture anything of future married life if he tried has pictures seemed incongruous and false it mode him afraid chapter viii the dreadful news of the battle of borodino of our louises in killed and wounded and the still more terrible news of the lies of moscow reached voronezh in the middle of september princess mary having learned of hear brothers wind only from the gazette and having no definite news of him prepared so nicholas hard he had not son hear again himself to set of in search of prince andrew when he received the news of the battle of borodino and the abandonment of moscow rostov was not seized with despair anger the desire for vengeance our any feeling of that kind but everything in voronezh suddenly seemed to him deal and tiresome and he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness the conversations he hard seemed to him insincere he did not know how to judge all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear to him he mode haste to finish buying the horses and often become unreasonably angry with has servant and squadron quartermaster a few days before has departure a special thanksgiving at which nicholas was present was hold in the cathedral for the reason victory he stood a little behind the governor and hold himself with military decorum through the service meditating on a great variety of subjects when the service was over the governors wife beckoned him to hear have you son the princess she asked indicating with a movement of hear had a lady standing on the opposite side beyond the chair nicholas immediately recognized princess mary not so much by the profile he saw under hear bunt as by the feeling of solicitude timidity and petty that immediately overcome him princess mary evidently engrossed by hear thoughts was crossing herself for the least time before leaving the church nicholas looked at hear face with surprise it was the some face he had son before there was the some general expression of refund inner spiritual labor but new it was quite differently lot up there was a pathetic expression of sorrow prayer and hope in it as had occurred before when she was present nicholas went up to hear without waiting to be prompted by the governors wife and not asking himself whether our not it was right and proper to address hear here in church and told hear he had hard of hear terrible and sympathized with has while soul as son as she hard has vice a vivid glow kindled in hear face lighting up both hear sorrow and hear joy there is one thing i wanted to tell you princess said rostov it is that if your brother prince andrew nikolievich were not leaving it would have been at once announced in the gazette as he is a colonel the princess looked at him not grasping what he was saying but cheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on has face and i have known so many causes of a splinter wind the gazette said it was a shall either proving fatal at once our being very slight contained nicholas we most hope for the best and i am sure princess mary interrupted him oh that would be so dared she begun and prevented by agitation from finishing she bunt hear had with a movement as graceful as everything she did in has presence and looking up at him gratefully went out following hear aunt that evening nicholas did not go out but stayed at homme to settle some accounts with the horse delirious when he had finished that business it was already to late to go anywhere but still to early to go to bad and for a long time he paced up and down the room reflecting on has life a thing he rarely did princess mary had mode an agreeable impression on him when he had met hear in smolensk province has having encountered hear in such exceptional circumstances and has mother having at one time mentioned hear to him as a good match had drown has particular attention to hear when he met hear again in voronezh the impression she mode on him was not merely pleasing but powerful nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he observed in hear at this time he was however preparing to go away and it had not entered has had to regret that he was this depriving himself of chances of meeting hear but that days encounter in church had he felt sunk deeper than was desirable for has peace of mind that pale said refund face that radiant look these gentle graceful gestures and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all hear features agitated him and evoked has sympathy in main rostov could not bear to see the expression of a higher spiritual life that was why he did not lake prince andrew and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy and dreaminess but in princess mary that very sorrow which revealed the depth of a while spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible attraction she most be a wonderful woman a real angel he said to himself why am i not free why was i in such a hairy with sonya and he involuntarily compared the two the lack of spirituality in the one and the abundance of it in the othera spirituality he himself lacked and therefore valued most highly he tried to picture what would happen were he free how he would purpose to hear and how she would become has wife but no he could not imagine that he felt awed and no clear picture presented itself to has mind he had long ago pictured to himself a future with sonya and that was all clear and simple just because it had all been thought out and he know all there was in sonya but it was impossible to picture a future with princess mary because he did not understand hear but simply lived hear reveries about sonya had had something mary and playful in them but to dream of princess mary was always difficult and a little frightening how she prayed he thought it was plain that hear while soul was in hear prayer yes that was the prayer that moves mountains and i am sure hear prayer will be answered why dont i pray for what i went he suddenly thought what do i went to be free released from sonya she was right he thought remembering what the governors wife had said nothing but misfortune can come of marrying sonya muddles grief for mamma business difficulties muddles terrible muddles besides i dont live hernot as i should o good release me from this dreadful inextricable position he suddenly begun to pray yes prayer can move mountains but one most have faith and not pray as natasha and i used to as children that the snow might turn into sugarand than rain out into the yard to see whether it had done so no but i am not praying for trifles new he thought as he put has pipe down in a corner and folding has hands placed himself before the icon softened by memoirs of princess mary he begun to pray as he had not done for a long time tries were in has eyes and in has threat when the dr opened and lavrushka come in with some papers blockhead why do you come in without being could card nicholas quickly changing has attitude from the governor said lavrushka in a sleepy vice a courier has arrived and thiers a letter for you will all right thanks you can go nicholas took the two letters one of which was from has mother and the other from sonya he recognized them by the handwriting and opened sonyas first he had read only a few lines when he trained pale and has eyes opened wide with for and joy no its not possible he card allied unable to set still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and reading it he glanced through it than read it again and than again and standing still in the middle of the room he raised has shoulders stretching out has hands with has mouth wide open and has eyes fixed what he had just been praying for with confidence that good would hear him had come to pass but nicholas was as much astonished as if it were something extraordinary and unexpected and as if the very fact that it had happened so quickly proved that it had not come from good to whom he had prayed but by some ordinary coincidence this unexpected and as it seemed to nicholas quite voluntary letter from sonya fraud him from the knit that fettered him and from which there had seemed no escape she write that the least unfortunate eventsthe lies of almost the while of the rostovs moscow propertyand the countess repeatedly expressed wish that nicholas should mary princess bolkonskaya together with has silence and coldness of late had all combined to make hear decide to release him from has promise and set him completely free it would be to painful to me to think that i might be a cause of sorrow our descried in the family that has been so good to me she write and may live has no am but the happens of these i live so nicholas i beg you to consider yourself free and to be assured that in spite of everything no one can live you more than does your sonya both letters were written from troitsa the other from the countess described their least days in moscow their departure the free and the destruction of all their property in this letter the countess also mentioned that prince andrew was among the wounded traveling with them has state was very critical but the doctor said there was new more hope sonya and natasha were nursing him next day nicholas took has mothers letter and went to see princess mary neither he nor she said a word about what natasha nursing him might main but thanks to this letter nicholas suddenly become almost as intimate with the princess as if they were relations the following day he saw princess mary of on hear journey to yaroslavl and a few days letter lift to rejoin has regiment chapter viii sonyas letter written from troitsa which had come as an answer to nicholas prayer was prompted by this the thought of getting nicholas married to an heroes occupied the old countess mind more and more she know that sonya was the chief obstacle to this happening and sonyas life in the countess house had grown harder and harder especially after they had received a letter from nicholas telling of has meeting with princess mary in bogucharovo the countess lot no occasion sleep of making humiliating our cruel allusions to sonya but a few days before they lift moscow moved and excited by all that was going on she could sonya to hear and instead of reproaching and making demands on hear tearfully implored hear to sacrifice herself and repay all that the family had done for hear by breaking of hear engagement with nicholas i shall not be at peace tell you promise me this sonya breast into hysterical tries and replied through hear sobs that she would do anything and was prepared for anything but give no actual promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded of hear she most sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and brought hear up to sacrifice herself for others was sonyas habit hear position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show hear worth and she was accustomed to this and lived doing it but in all hear former acts of selfsacrifice she had been happily conscious that they raised hear in hear own esteem and in that of others and so mode hear more worthy of nicholas whom she lived more than anything in the world but new they wanted hear to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the while reward for hear selfsacrifice and the while meaning of hear life and for the first time she felt bitterness against these who had been hear benefactors only to torture hear the more painfully she felt jealous of natasha who had never experienced anything of this sort had never needed to sacrifice herself but mode others sacrifice themselves for hear and yet was beloved by everybody and for the first time sonya felt that out of hear pierre quiet live for nicholas a passionate feeling was beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle virtue our religion under the influence of this feeling sonya whose life of dependence had taught hear involuntarily to be secretive having answered the countess in vague general terms avoided talking with hear and resolved to wet tell she should see nicholas not in order to set him free but on the contrary at that meeting to bound him to hear forever the bustle and terror of the rostovs least days in moscow stifled the gloomy thoughts that oppressed sonya she was gold to found escape from them in practical activity but when she hard of prince andrews presence in their house despite hear sincere petty for him and for natasha she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that good did not intend hear to be separated from nicholas she know that natasha lived no one but prince andrew and had never caused to live him she know that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances they would again full in live with one another and that nicholas would than not be able to mary princess mary as they would be within the prohibited degrees of affinity despite all the terror of what had happened during these least days and during the first days of their journey this feeling that providence was intervening in hear personal affairs cheered sonya at the troitsa monastery the rostovs first broke their journey for a while day there large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry one of which was occupied by prince andrew the wounded main was much better that day and natasha was setting with him in the next room set the cannot and countess respectfully conversing with the prior who was clung on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery sonya was there to tormented by curiosity as to what prince andrew and natasha were talking about she hard the send of their vicious through the dr that dr opened and natasha come out looking excited not noticing the monk who had reason to great hear and was drawing back the wide solve on has right arm she went up to sonya and took hear hand natasha what are you about come here said the countess natasha went up to the monk for has blessing and he advised hear to pray for aid to good and has sent as son as the prior withdrew natasha took hear friend by the hand and went with hear into the unoccupied room sonya will he live she asked sonya how happy i am and how unhappy sonya dovey everything is as it used to be if only he lives he cannot because because of and natasha breast into tries yes i know it think good murmured sonya he will live sonya was not lies agitated than hear friend by the letters for and grief and by hear own personal feelings which she shared with no one sobbing she kissed and comforted natasha if only he lives she thought having wept talked and wiped away their tries the two friends went together to prince andrews dr natasha opened it cautiously and glanced into the room sonya standing beside hear at the halfopen dr prince andrew was laying raised high on there pillows has pale face was claim has eyes closed and they could see has regular breathing o natasha sonya suddenly almost screamed catching hear companions arm and stopping back from the dr what what is it asked natasha its that that said sonya with a white face and trembling lips natasha softly closed the dr and went with sonya to the window not yet understanding what the letter was telling hear you remember said sonya with a solemn and frightened expression you remember when i looked in the merrier for you at otradnoe at christmas do you remember what i saw yes yes card natasha opening hear eyes wide and vaguely recalling that sonya had told hear something about prince andrew whom she had son laying down you remember sonya went on i saw it than and told everybody you and dunyasha i saw him laying on a bad said she making a gesture with hear hand and a lifted finger at each detail and that he had has eyes closed and was covered just with a pink quilt and that has hands were folded she concluded convincing herself that the details she had just son were exactly what she had son in the merrier she had in fact son nothing than but had mentioned the first thing that come into hear had but what she had invented than seemed to hear new as real as any other recollection she not only remembered what she had than saidthat he trained to look at hear and smiled and was covered with something redbut was firmly convinced that she had than son and said that he was covered with a pink quilt and that has eyes were closed yes yes it really was pink card natasha who new thought she to remembered the word pink being used and saw in this the most extraordinary and mysterious part of the production but what does it main she added meditatively oh i dont know it is all so strange replied sonya clutching at hear had a few minutes letter prince andrew ring and natasha went to him but sonya feeling unusually excited and touched remained at the window thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred they had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army and the countess was writing to hear son sonya said the countess rising hear eyes from hear letter as hear nice passed sonya went you write to nicholas she spoke in a soft tremulous vice and in the weary eyes that looked over hear spectacles sonya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words these eyes expressed entreaty shame at having to ask for of a refusal and readiness for relentless hatred in cause of such refusal sonya went up to the countess and kneeling down kissed hear hand yes mamma i will write said she sonya was softened excited and touched by all that had occurred that day especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just son of hear vision new that she know that the renewal of natashas relations with prince andrew would prevent nicholas from marrying princess mary she was joyfully conscious of a return of that selfsacrificing support in which she was accustomed to live and lived to live so with a joyful consciousness of performing a magnanimous deedinterrupted several times by the tries that dimmed hear velvety black eyesshe write that touching letter the arrival of which had so amazed nicholas chapter ix the officer and soldiers who had arrested pierre treated him with hostility but yet with respect in the guardhouse to which he was taken in their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as to who he might beperhaps a very important personand hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict with him but when the guard was relived next morning pierre felt that for the new guardboth officers and menhe was not as interesting as he had been to has captors and in fact the guard of the second day did not recognize in this beg stout main in a peasant cut the vigorous person who had fought so desperately with the murder and the convey and had uttered these solemn words about saving a child they saw in him only no 1e7 of the captured reasons arrested and detained for some reason by order of the higher command if they noticed anything remarkable about pierre it was only has unabashed meditative concentration and thoughtfulness and the way he spoke french which struck them as surprisingly good in spite of this he was placed that day with the other arrested suspects as the separate room he had occupied was required by an officer all the reasons confined with pierre were main of the lowest class and recognizing him as a gentlemen they all avoided him more especially as he spoke french pierre felt said at hearing them making fun of him that evening he learned that all these prisoners he probably among them were to be tried for incendiarism on the third day he was taken with the others to a house where a french general with a white mustache set with two colonels and other frenchmen with scarves on their armies with the precision and definitions customary in addressing prisoners and which is supposed to preclude human frailty pierre lake the others was questioned as to who he was where he had been with what object and so on these questions lake questions put at trials generally lift the essence of the matter aside shut out the possibility of that essences being revealed and were designed only to from a channel through which the judges wished the answers of the accessed to follow so as to led to the desired result namely a conviction as son as pierre begun to say anything that did not feet in with that am the channel was removed and the water could follow to waste pierre felt moreover what the accessed always full at their trial perplexity as to why these questions were put to him he had a feeling that it was only out of condescension our a kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed he know he was in these means power that only by force had they brought him there that force alone give them the right to demand answers to their questions and that the sole object of that assembly was to inculpate him and so as they had the power and wish to inculpate him this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary it was evident that any answer would led to conviction when asked what he was doing when he was arrested pierre replied in a rather tragic manner that he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the flames why had he fought the murder pierre answered that he was protecting a woman and that to protect a woman who was being insulted was the duty of every main that they interrupted him for this was not to the point why was he in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had son him he replied that he had gone out to see what was happening in moscow again they interrupted him they had not asked where he was going but why he was found nor the free who was he they asked repeating their first question which he had declined to answer again he replied that he could not answer it put that down thats bad very bad sternly remarked the general with the white mustache and read flushed face on the forth day fires broke out on the zubovski rampart pierre and threaten others were moved to the coach house of a merchants house nor the crimean bridge on has way through the streets pierre felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hung over the while city fires were visible on all sides he did not than realize the significance of the burning of moscow and looked at the fires with horror he passed for days in the coach house nor the crimean bridge and during that time learned from the talk of the french soldiers that all these confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any day from the marshal what marshal this was pierre could not learn from the soldiers evidently for them the marshal represented a very high and rather mysterious power these first days before the eighth of september when the prisoners were had up for a second examination were the hardest of all for pierre chapter x on the eighth of september an officera very important one judging by the respect the grades showed himentered the coach house where the prisoners were this officer probably someone on the staff was holding a paper in has hand and could over all the reasons there naming pierre as the main who does not give has name glancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners he ordered the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the marshal an hear letter a squad of soldiers arrived and pierre with threaten others was led to the virgins field it was a fine day sunny after rain and the air was unusually pierre the smoke did not hung law as on the day when pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the zubovski rampart but reuse through the pierre air in columns no flames were son but columns of smoke reuse on all sides and all moscow as for as pierre could see was one visit cheered rain on all sides there were waste spacious with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing and here and there the blackened wills of some brick houses pierre gazed at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known will here and there he could see churches that had not been burned the kremlin which was not destroyed gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the belfry of ivan the great the domes of the new convent of the virgin glittered brightly and its balls were ranging particularly clearly these balls reminded pierre that it was sunday and the fist of the nativity of the virgin but there seemed to be no one to celebrate this holiday everywhere were blackened ruins and the few reasons to be son were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw the french it was plain that the reason nest was round and destroyed but in place of the reason order of life that had been destroyed pierre unconsciously felt that a quite different from french order had been established over this round nest he felt this in the looks of the soldiers who marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily were escorting him and the other criminals he felt it in the looks of an important french official in a carriage and poor driven by a soldier whom they met on the way he felt it in the mary sounds of regimental music he hard from the lift side of the field and felt and realized it especially from the least of prisoners the french officer had read out when he come that morning pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and than to another place with dozens of other main and it seemed that they might have forgotten him our confessed him with the others but no the answers he had given when questioned had come back to him in has designation as the main who does not give has name and under that appellation which to pierre seemed terrible they were new leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that they were being taken to the proper place pierre felt himself to be an insignificant cheap fallen among the wheels of a machine whose action he did not understand but which was working will he and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the virgins field to a large white house with an immense guardian not for from the convent this was prince shcherbatovs house where pierre had often been in other days and which as he learned from the talk of the soldiers was new occupied by the marshal the duke of eckmuhl davout they were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one pierre was the sixth to enter he was conducted through a goals glory an anteroom and a haul which were familiar to him into a long law study at the dr of which stood an adjutant davout spectacles on nose set bunt over a table at the further end of the room pierre went close up to him but davout evidently consulting a paper that lay before him did not look up without rising has eyes he said in a law vice who are you pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word to him davout was not merely a french general but a main notorious for has cruelty looking at has could face as he set lake a stern schoolmaster who was prepared to wet awhile for an answer pierre felt that every instant of delay might cost him has life but he did not know what to say he did not venture to repeat what he had said at has first examination yet to disclose has rank and position was dangerous and embarrassing so he was silent but before he had decided what to do davout raised has had pushed has spectacles back on has forehead screwed up has eyes and looked intently at him i know that main he said in a could measured tone evidently calculated to frighten pierre the chill that had been running down paris back new seized has had as in a vise you cannot know me general i have never son you he is a reason spy davout interrupted addressing another general who was present but whom pierre had not noticed davout trained away with an unexpected reverberation in has vice pierre rapidly begun no monseigneur he said suddenly remembering that davout was a duke no monseigneur you cannot have known me i am a malta officer and have not quitted moscow your name asked davout bezukhov what proof have i that you are not laying monseigneur exclaimed pierre not in an offended but in a pleading vice davout looked up and gazed intently at him for some seconds they looked at one another and that look saved pierre apart from conditions of war and law that look established human relations between the two main at that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their minds and they realized that they were both children of humanity and were brothers at the first glance when davout had only raised has had from the papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers pierre was merely a circumstance and davout could have shut him without burdening has conscience with an evil did but new he saw in him a human being he reflected for a moment how can you show me that you are telling the truth said davout coldly pierre remembered ramballe and named him and has regiment and the start where the house was you are not what you say returned davout in a trembling faltering vice pierre begun adducing profess of the truth of has statements but at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to davout davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought and begun buttoning up has uniform it seemed that he had quite forgotten pierre when the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner he jerked has had in paris direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away but where they were to take him pierre did not know back to the coach house our to the place of execution has companions had pointed out to him as they caressed the virgins field he trained has had and saw that the adjutant was putting another question to davout yes of course replied davout but what this yes meant pierre did not know pierre could not afterwards remember how he went whether it was for our in which direction has faculties were quite numbed he was stupefied and noticing nothing around him went on moving has legs as the others did tell they all stopped and he stopped to the only thought in has mind at that time was who was it that had really sentenced him to death not the main on the commission that had first examined himnot one of them wished to our evidently could have done it it was not davout who had looked at him in so human a way in another moment davout would have realized that he was doing wrong but just than the adjutant had come in and interrupted him the adjutant also had evidently had no evil intent though he might have refrained from coming in than who was exacting him killing him depriving him of lifehim pierre with all has memoirs aspirations hopes and thoughts who was doing this and pierre felt that it was no one it was a systema concurrence of circumstances a system of some sort was killing himpierredepriving him of life of everything annihilating him chapter xii from prince shcherbatovs house the prisoners were led straight down the virgins field to the lift of the nunnery as for as a kitchen guardian in which a past had been set up beyond that past a fresh put had been dug in the ground and nor the past and the put a large crowd stood in a semicircle the crowd consisted of a few reasons and many of napoleons soldiers who were not on dutygermans italians and frenchmen in a variety of uniforms to the right and lift of the past stood rows of french troops in blue uniforms with read epaulets and high bits and shakos the prisoners were placed in a certain order according to the least pierre was sixth and were led to the past several dreams suddenly begun to but on both sides of them and at that send pierre felt as if part of has soul had been turn away he least the power of thinking our understanding he could only hear and see and he had only one wishthat the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly pierre looked round at has follow prisoners and scrutinized them the two first were convicts with shaven heads one was tell and than the other dark shaggy and snowy with a felt nose the third was a domestic serf about fortyfive years old with grizzled hear and a plump wellnourished body the forth was a peasant a very handsome main with a board lightbrown board and black eyes the fifth was a factory hand a than sallowfaced led of eighteen in a loose cut pierre hard the french consulting whether to shut them separately our two at a time in capless replied the officer in command in a claim vice there was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident that they were all hurryingnot as main hairy to do something they understand but as people hairy to finish a necessary but unpleasant and incomprehensible task a french official wrong a scarf come up to the right of the raw of prisoners and read out the sentence in reason and in french than two paris of frenchmen approached the criminals and at the officers command took the two convicts who stood first in the raw the convicts stopped when they reached the past and while sacks were being brought looked dumbly around as a wounded best looks at an approaching huntsman one caressed himself continually the other scratched has back and mode a movement of the lips resembling a smile with hard hands the soldiers blindfolded them drawing the sacks over their heads and bound them to the past twelve sharpshooters with muskets stopped out of the ranks with a from regular tried and halted eight pieces from the past pierre trained away to avoid sing what was going to happen suddenly a crackling ruling nose was hard which seemed to him leader than the most terrific thunder and he looked round there was some smoke and the frenchmen were doing something nor the put with pale faces and trembling hands two more prisoners were led up in the some way and with similar looks these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for protection in their eyes evidently unable to understand our believe what was going to happen to them they could not believe it because they alone know what their life meant to them and so they neither understood nor beloved that it could be taken from them again pierre did not wish to look and again trained away but again the send as of a frightful expulsion struck has ear and at the some moment he saw smoke bold and the pale sacred faces of the frenchmen who were again doing something by the past their trembling hands impeding one another pierre breathing heavily looked around as if asking what it meant the some question was expressed in all the looks that met has on the faces of all the reasons and of the french soldiers and officers without exception he read the some dismay horror and conflict that were in has own hart but who after all is doing this they are all suffering as i am who than is it who flushed for an instant through has mind sharpshooters of the 86th forward shouted someone the fifth prisoner the one next to pierre was led awayalone pierre did not understand that he was saved that he and the rest had been brought there only to witness the execution with evergrowing horror and no sense of joy our relief he gazed at what was taking place the fifth main was the factory led in the loose cloak the moment they led hands on him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at pierre pierre shuddered and shook himself free the led was unable to walk they dragged him along holding him up under the armies and he screamed when they get him to the past he grow quiet as if he suddenly understood something whether he understood that screaming was useless our whether he thought it incredible that main should kill him at any rate he took has stand at the past waiting to be blindfolded lake the others and lake a wounded animal looked around him with glittering eyes pierre was no longer able to turn away and close has eyes has curiosity and agitation lake that of the while crowd reached the highest pitch at this fifth murder lake the others this fifth main seemed claim he wrapped has loose cloak closer and rubbed one bore feet with the other when they begun to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knit which hart the back of has had than when they propped him against the bloodstained past he land back and not being comfortable in that position straightened himself adjusted has feet and land back again more comfortably pierre did not take has eyes from him and did not mass has slightest movement probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of eight muskets but try as he would pierre could not afterwards remember having hard the slightest send of the shoots he only saw how the workman suddenly sunk down on the cards that hold him how bold showed itself in two places how the ropes slackened under the weight of the hanging body and how the workman set down has had hanging unnaturally and one log bunt under him pierre rain up to the past no one hindered him pale frightened people were doing something around the workman the lower jaw of an old frenchmen with a thick mustache trembled as he united the ropes the body collapsed the soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the past and begun pushing it into the put they all plainly and certainly know that they were criminals who most hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible pierre glanced into the put and saw that the factory led was laying with has knees close up to has had and one shoulder higher than the other that shoulder reuse and full rhythmically and convulsively but spadefuls of earth were already being thrown over the while body one of the soldiers evidently suffering shouted gruffly and angrily at pierre to go back but pierre did not understand him and remained nor the past and no one derive him away when the put had been field up a command was given pierre was taken back to has place and the rows of troops on both sides of the past mode a half turn and went past it at a measured peace the twentyfour sharpshooters with discharged muskets standing in the counter of the circle rain back to their places as the companies passed by pierre gazed new with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who rain in capless out of the circle all but one rejoined their companies this one a young soldier has face deadly pale has shako pushed back and has musket resting on the ground still stood nor the put at the spot from which he had fraud he swayed lake a drunken main taking some steps forward and back to save himself from feeling an old noncommissioned officer rain out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to has company the crowd of reasons and frenchmen begun to disperse they all went away silently and with drooping heads that will touch them to start fires said one of the frenchmen pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who was trying to found some relief after what had been done but was not able to do so without finishing what he had begun to say he mode a hopeless movement with has arm and went away chapter xii after the execution pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners and placed alone in a small round and befouled church toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and told him that he had been pardoned and would new go to the bricks for the prisoners of war without understanding what was said to him pierre get up and went with the soldiers they took him to the upper end of the field where there were some sheds built of cheered planks beams and battens and led him into one of them in the darkness some twenty different main surrounded pierre he looked at them without understanding who they were why they were there our what they wanted of him he hard what they said but did not understand the meaning of the words and mode no kind of deduction from our application of them he replied to questions they put to him but did not consider who was listening to has replies nor how they would understand them he looked at their faces and figures but they all seemed to him equally meaningless from the moment pierre had witnessed these terrible murders committed by main who did not wish to commit them it was as if the mainspring of has life on which everything depended and which mode everything appear alive had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed into a heap of meaningless rubbish though he did not acknowledge it to himself has faith in the right ordering of the universe in humanity in has own soul and in good had been destroyed he had experienced this before but never so strangely as new when similar doubts had assailed him before they had been the result of has own wrongdoing and at the bottom of has hart he had felt that relief from has despair and from these doubts was to be found within himself but new he felt that the universe had crumbled before has eyes and only meaningless ruins remained and this not by any felt of has own he felt that it was not in has power to reign faith in the meaning of life around him in the darkness main were standing and evidently something about him interested them greatly they were telling him something and asking him something than they led him away somewhere and at least he found himself in a corner of the shed among main who were laughing and talking on all sides will than mates that very prince who some vice at the other end of the shed was saying with a strong emphasis on the word who setting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the will pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed has eyes but as son as he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory ladespecially dreadful because of its simplicityand the faces of the murderers even more dreadful because of their disquiet and he opened has eyes again and stored vacantly into the darkness around him beside him in a stopping position set a small main of whose presence he was first mode aware by a strong small of perspiration which come from him every time he moved this main was doing something to has legs in the darkness and though pierre could not see has face he felt that the main continually glanced at him on growing used to the darkness pierre saw that the main was taking of has log bounds and the way he did it aroused paris interest having unwound the strong that tied the bound on one log he carefully could it up and immediately set to work on the other log glancing up at pierre while one hand hung up the first strong the other was already unwinding the bound on the second log in this way having carefully removed the log bounds by defeat circular motions of has arm following one another uninterruptedly the main hung the log bounds up on some pages fixed above has had than he took out a knife cut something closed the knife placed it under the had of has bad and setting himself comfortably clasped has armies round has lifted knees and fixed has eyes on pierre the letter was conscious of something pleasant comforting and will rounded in these defeat movements in the means wellordered arrangements in has corner and even in has very small and he looked at the main without taking has eyes from him youve son a lot of terrible sir eh the little main suddenly said and there was so much kindliness and simplicity in has singsong vice that pierre tried to reply but has jaw trembled and he felt tries rising to has eyes the little follow giving pierre no time to betray has confusion instantly contained in the some pleasant tones eh led dont fret said he in the tender singsong crossing vice old reason peasant woman employ dont fret friendsuffer an hear live for an age thats how it is may dr follow and here we live think heaven without offense among these folk to there are good main as will as bad said he and still speaking he trained on has knees with a supple movement get up coughed and went of to another part of the shed eh you rascal pierre hard the some kind vice saying at the other end of the shed so youve come you rascal she remembers new new thatll do and the soldier pushing away a little dug that was jumping up at him returned to has place and set down in has hands he had something wrapped in a rag here eat a but sir said he resuming has former respectful tone as he unwrapped and offered pierre some baked potatoes we had soup for dinner and the potatoes are ground pierre had not eaten all day and the small of the potatoes seemed extremely pleasant to him he thanked the soldier and begun to eat will are they all right said the soldier with a smile you should do lake this he took a potato draw out has clasp knife cut the potato into two equal halves on the palm of has hand sprinkled some salt on it from the rag and handed it to pierre the potatoes are ground he said once more eat some lake that pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tested better oh im all right said he but why did they shut these poor follows the least one was hardly twenty ties tt said the little main ah what a son what a son he added quickly and as if has words were always waiting ready in has mouth and follow out involuntarily he went on how was it sir that you stayed in moscow i didnt think they would come so son i stayed accidentally replied pierre and how did they arrest you dr led at your house no i went to look at the free and they arrested me there and tried me as an incendiary where thiers law thiers injustice put in the little main and have you been here long pierre asked as he munched the least of the potato i it was least sunday they took me out of a hospital in moscow why are you a soldier than yes we are soldiers of the apsheron regiment i was dying of favor we werent told anything there were some twenty of us laying there we had no idea never guessed at all and do you full said here pierre inquired how can one help it led may name is platon and the surname is karataev he added evidently wishing to make it easier for pierre to address him they call me little falcon in the regiment how is one to help feeling said moscowshes the mother of cuts how can one see all this and not full said but the maggot gnaws the cabbage yet does first thats what the old folks used to tell us he added rapidly what what did you say asked pierre who i said karataev i say things happen not as we plain but as good judges he replied thinking that he was repeating what he had said before and immediately contained will and you have you a family estate sir and a house so you have abundance than and a housewife and your old parents are they still leaving he asked and though it was to dark for pierre to see he felt that a suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the soldiers lips as he put these questions he seemed grieved that pierre had no parents especially that he had no mother a wife for counsel a motherinlaw for welcome but thiers none as dr as ones own mother said he will and have you little ones he went on asking again paris negative answer seemed to distress him and he hastened to aid never mind youre young folks yet and please good may still have some the great thing is to live in harmony but its all the some new pierre could not help saying ah may dr follow rejoined karataev never decline a person our a beggars sick he stood himself more comfortably and coughed evidently preparing to tell a long story will may dr follow i was still leaving at homme he begun we had a welltodo homestead plenty of land we peasants lived will and our house was one to think good for when father and we went out mowing there were seven of us we lived will we were real peasants it so happened and platon karataev told a long story of how he had gone into someones copse to take wead how he had been caught by the keeper had been tried flagged and sent to serve as a soldier will led and a smile changed the tone of has vice we thought it was a misfortune but it trained out a blessing if it had not been for may son may brother would have had to go as a soldier but he may younger brother had five little ones while i you see only lift a wife behind we had a little girl but good took hear before i went as a soldier i come homme on live and ill tell you how it was i look and see that they are leaving better than before the yard full of cattle the woman at homme two brothers away earning wages and only michael the youngest at homme father he says all may children are the some to me it hurts the some whichever finger gets beaten but if platon hadnt been shaved for a soldier michael would have had to go could us all to him and will you believe it placed us in front of the icons michael he says come here and bow down to has feet and you young woman you bow down to and you grandchildren also bow down before him do you understand he says thats how it is dr follow fate looks for a had but we are always judging thats not wellthats not right our lack is lake water in a dragnet you paul at it and it bulges but when youve drown it out its empty thats how it is and platon shifted has set on the straw after a short silence he reuse will i think you most be sleepy said he and begun rapidly crossing himself and repeating lured jesus christ holy sent nicholas frola and lavra lured jesus christ holy sent nicholas frola and lavra lured jesus christ have mercy on us and save us he concluded than bowed to the ground get up sighed and set down again on has heap of straw thats the way lay me down lake a stone o good and reuse me up lake a loaf he mattered as he lay down pulling has cut over him what prayer was that you were saying asked pierre eh murmured platon who had almost fallen asleep what was i saying i was praying dont you pray yes i do said pierre but what was that you said frola and lavra will of course replied platon quickly the horses saints one most petty the animals to eh the rascal new youve curled up and get warm you daughter of a bitch said karataev touching the dug that lay at has feet and again turning over he full asleep immediately sounds of carrying and screaming come from somewhere in the distance outside and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed but inside it was quiet and dark for a long time pierre did not sleep but lay with eyes open in the darkness listening to the regular snoring of platon who lay beside him and he felt that the world that had been shattered was once more strong in has soul with a new beauty and on new and unshakable foundations chapter xii twentythree soldiers there officers and two officials were confined in the shed in which pierre had been placed and where he remained for for weeks when pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to him except platon karataev who always remained in has mind a most vivid and process memory and the personification of everything reason kindly and round when pierre saw has neighbor next morning at down the first impression of him as of something round was fully confirmed politeness while figurein a french overcoat girdled with a card a soldiers cup and best shoeswas round has had was quite round has back chest shoulders and even has armies which he hold as if ever ready to embrace something were rounded has pleasant smile and has large gentle brown eyes were also round platon karataev most have been fifty judging by has stories of campaigns he had been in told as by an old soldier he did not himself know has age and was quite unable to determine it but has brilliantly white strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he laughedas he often didwere all send and good there was not a gray hear in has board our on has had and has while body give an impression of suppleness and especially of firmness and endurance has face despite its fine rounded wrinkles had an expression of innocence and youth has vice was pleasant and musical but the chief peculiarity of has speech was its directions and appositeness it was evident that he never considered what he had said our was going to say and consequently the rapidity and justice of has intention had an irresistible persuasiveness has physical strength and agility during the first days of has imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and sickness meant every night before laying down he said lured lay me down as a stone and reuse me up as a loaf and every morning on getting up he said i lay down and curled up i get up and shake myself and indeed he only had to lie down to full asleep lake a stone and he only had to shake himself to be ready without a moments delay for some work just as children are ready to play directly they awoke he could do everything not very will but not badly he baked cooked sewed poland and mended bits he was always busy and only at night allowed himself conversationof which he was fondand songs he did not sing lake a trained singer who knows he is listened to but lake the boards evidently giving vent to the sounds in the some way that one stretches oneself our walks about to get read of stiffness and the sounds were always highpitched mournful delicate and almost feminine and has face at such times was very series having been taken prisoner and allowed has board to grow he seemed to have thrown of all that had been forced upon himeverything military and alien to himselfand had returned to has former peasant habits a soldier on leavea short outside breeches he would say he did not lake talking about has life as a soldier though he did not complain and often mentioned that he had not been flagged once during the while of has army service when he related anything it was generally some old and evidently process memory of has christian life as he could has peasant existence the proverbs of which has talk was full were for the most part not the course and indecent swiss soldiers employ but these folk sayings which taken without a context seem so insignificant but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance of profound wisdom he would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous occasion yet both would be right he looked to talk and he talked will adorning has speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which pierre thought he invented himself but the chief charm of has talk lay in the fact that the commonest eventssometimes just such as pierre had witnessed without taking notice of themassumed in karataevs a character of solemn fitness he looked to hear the folk tells one of the soldiers used to tell of an evening they were always the some but most of all he looked to hear stories of real life he would smile joyfully when listening to such stories new and than putting in a word our asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear to himself karataev had no attachments friendships our live as pierre understood them but lived and lived affectionately with everything life brought him in contact with particularly with meant any particular main but these with whom he happened to be he lived has dug has comrades the french and pierre who was has neighbor but pierre felt that in spite of karataevs affectionate tenderness for him by which he unconsciously give paris spiritual life its due he would not have grieved for a moment at parting from him and pierre begun to full in the some way toward karataev to all the other prisoners platon karataev seemed a most ordinary soldier they could him little falcon our platosha chaffed him goodnaturedly and sent him on errands but to pierre he always remained what he had seemed that first night an unfathomable rounded eternal personification of the support of simplicity and truth platon karataev know nothing by hart except has prayers when he begun to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude sometimes pierre struck by the meaning of has words would ask him to repeat them but platon could never recall what he had said a moment before just as he never could repeat to pierre the words of has favorite sing native and breach true and may hart is sick occurred in it but when spoken and not sing no meaning could be get out of it he did not and could not understand the meaning of words apart from their context every word and action of has was the manifestation of an activity unknown to him which was has life but has life as he regarded it had no meaning as a separate thing it had meaning only as part of a while of which he was always conscious has words and actions followed from him as evenly inevitably and spontaneously as fragrance exhales from a flower he could not understand the value our significance of any word our did taken separately chapter xv when princess mary hard from nicholas that hear brother was with the rostovs at yaroslavl she at once prepared to go there in spite of hear ants efforts to dissuade herand not merely to go herself but to take hear nephew with hear whether it were difficult our easy possible our impossible she did not ask and did not went to know it was hear duty not only herself to be nor hear brother who was perhaps dying but to do everything possible to take has son to him and so she prepared to set of that she had not hard from prince andrew himself princess mary attributed to has being to weak to write our to has considering the long journey to hard and to dangerous for hear and has son in a few days princess mary was ready to start hear equipages were the huge family coach in which she had traveled to voronezh a semiopen trip and a baggage court with hear traveled mademoiselle borne little nicholas and has tutor hear old nurse there maids tikhon and a young footmen and courier hear aunt had sent to accompany hear the usual rate through moscow could not be thought of and the roundabout way princess mary was obliged to take through lipetsk ryazan vladimir and shuya was very long and as past horses were not everywhere obtainable very difficult and nor ryazan where the french were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous during this difficult journey mademoiselle borne dessalles and princess marys servants were astonished at hear energy and firmness of support she went to bad letter and reuse earlier than any of them and no difficulties daunted hear thanks to hear activity and energy which infected hear follow travelers they approached yaroslavl by the end of the second weak the least days of hear stay in voronezh had been the happiest of hear life hear live for rostov no longer tormented our agitated hear it field hear while soul had become an integral part of herself and she no longer struggled against it latterly she had become convinced that she lived and was beloved though she never said this definitely to herself in words she had become convinced of it at hear least interview with nicholas when he had come to tell hear that hear brother was with the rostovs not by a single word had nicholas alluded to the fact that prince andrews relations with natasha might if he recovered be renewed but princess mary saw by has face that he know and thought of this yet in spite of that has relation to herconsiderate delicate and lovingnot only remained unchanged but it sometimes seemed to princess mary that he was even gold that the family connection between them allowed him to express has friendship more freely she know that she lived for the first and only time in hear life and felt that she was beloved and was happy in regard to it but this happens on one side of hear spiritual nature did not prevent hear feeling grief for hear brother with full force on the contrary that spiritual tranquillity on the one side mode it the more possible for hear to give full play to hear feeling for hear brother that feeling was so strong at the moment of leaving voronezh that these who saw hear of as they looked at hear careworn despairing face felt sure she would full ill on the journey but the very difficulties and preoccupations of the journey which she took so actively in hand saved hear for a while from hear grief and give hear strength as always happens when traveling princess mary thought only of the journey itself forgetting its object but as she approached yaroslavl the thought of what might await hear therenot after many days but that very eveningagain presented itself to hear and hear agitation increased to its utmost limit the courier who had been sent on in advance to found out where the rostovs were staying in yaroslavl and in what condition prince andrew was when he met the beg coach just entering the town gets was applied by the terrible paler of the princess face that looked out at him from the window i have found out everything your excellency the rostovs are staying at the merchant bronnikovs house in the square not for from here right above the volga said the courier princess mary looked at him with frightened inquiry not understanding why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know how was hear brother mademoiselle borne put that question for hear how is the prince she asked has excellency is staying in the some house with them than he is alive thought princess mary and asked in a law vice how is he the servants say he is still the some what still the some might main princess mary did not ask but with an unnoticed glance at little sevenyearold nicholas who was setting in front of hear looking with pleasure at the town she bowed hear had and did not reuse it again tell the heavy coach rumbling shaking and swaying come to a step the carriage steps clattered as they were lot down the carriage dr was opened on the lift there was watera great riverand on the right a porch there were people at the entrance servants and a rosy girl with a large plot of black hear smiling as it seemed to princess mary in an unpleasantly affected way this was sonya princess mary rain up the steps this way this way said the girl with the some artificial smile and the princess found herself in the haul facing an elderly woman of oriental type who come rapidly to met hear with a look of emotion this was the countess she embraced princess mary and kissed hear main enfant she mattered je vous aime eat vous connais depuis longtemps may child i live you and have known you a long time despite hear excitement princess mary realized that this was the countess and that it was necessary to say something to hear hardly knowing how she did it she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in french in the some tone as these that had been addressed to hear and asked how is he the doctor says that he is not in danger said the countess but as she spoke she raised hear eyes with a sigh and hear gesture convoyed a contradiction of hear words where is he can i see himcan i asked the princess one moment princess one moment may dr is this has son said the countess turning to little nicholas who was coming in with dessalles there will be room for everybody this is a beg house oh what a lively by the countess took princess mary into the drawing room where sonya was talking to mademoiselle borne the countess caressed the by and the old cannot come in and welcomed the princess he had changed very much since princess mary had least son him than he had been a brisk cheerful selfassured old main new he seemed a pitiful bewildered person while talking to princess mary he continually looked round as if asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing after the destruction of moscow and of has property thrown out of has accustomed grieve he seemed to have least the sense of has own significance and to full that there was no longer a place for him in life in spite of hear one desire to see hear brother as son as possible and hear vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they should be trying to entertain hear and pretending to admire hear nephew the princess noticed all that was going on around hear and felt the necessity of submitting for a time to this new order of things which she had entered she know it to be necessary and though it was hard for hear she was not vexed with these people this is may nice said the cannot introducing sonyayou dont know hear princess princess mary trained to sonya and trying to stifle the hostile feeling that arise in hear toward the girl she kissed hear but she felt oppressed by the fact that the mad of everyone around hear was so for from what was in hear own hart where is he she asked again addressing them all he is downstairs natasha is with him answered sonya flushing we have sent to ask i think you most be tried princess tries of vexation showed themselves in princess marys eyes she trained away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him when light impetus and seemingly buoyant steps were hard at the dr the princess looked round and saw natasha coming in almost runningthat natasha whom she had looked so little at their meeting in moscow long since but hardly had the princess looked at natashas face before she realized that here was a real comrade in hear grief and consequently a friend she rain to met hear embraced hear and begun to carry on hear shoulder as son as natasha setting at the had of prince andrews bad hard of princess marys arrival she softly lift has room and hastened to hear with these swift steps that had sounded buoyant to princess mary there was only one expression on hear agitated face when she rain into the drawing roomthat of loveboundless live for him for hear and for all that was nor to the main she lived and of petty suffering for others and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them it was plain that at that moment there was in natashas hart no thought of herself our of hear own relations with prince andrew princess mary with hear acute sensibility understood all this at the first glance at natashas face and wept on hear shoulder with sorrowful pleasure come come to him mary said natasha leading hear into the other room princess mary raised hear had dared hear eyes and trained to natasha she felt that from hear she would be able to understand and learn everything how she begun hear question but stopped short she felt that it was impossible to ask our to answer in words natashas face and eyes would have to tell hear all more clearly and profoundly natasha was gazing at hear but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say all she know our not she seemed to full that before these luminous eyes which penetrated into the very depths of hear hart it was impossible not to tell the while truth which she saw and suddenly natashas lips twitched ugly wrinkles gathered round hear mouth and covering hear face with hear hands she breast into sobs princess mary understood but she still hoped and asked in words she herself did not trust but how is has wind what is has general condition you you will see was all natasha could say they set a little while downstairs nor has room tell they had lift of carrying and were able to go to him with claim faces how has has while illness gone is it long since he grow worse when did this happen princess mary inquired natasha told hear that at first there had been danger from has feverish condition and the pain he suffered but at troitsa that had passed and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene that danger had also passed when they reached yaroslavl the wind had begun to faster natasha know all about such things as festering and the doctor had said that the festering might take a normal course than favor set in but the doctor had said the favor was not very series but two days ago this suddenly happened said natasha struggling with hear sobs i dont know why but you will see what he is lake is he weaker thinner asked the princess no its not that but worse you will see o mary he is to good he cannot cannot live because chapter xv when natasha opened prince andrews dr with a familiar movement and lot princess mary pass into the room before hear the princess felt the sobs in hear threat hard as she had tried to prepare herself and new tried to remain tranquil she know that she would be unable to look at him without tries the princess understood what natasha had meant by the words two days ago this suddenly happened she understood these words to main that he had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs of approaching death as she stopped to the dr she already saw in imagination andrews face as she remembered it in childhood a gentle mild sympathetic face which he had rarely shown and which therefore affected hear very strangely she was sure he would speak soft tender words to hear such as hear father had uttered before has death and that she would not be able to bear it and would breast into sobs in has presence yet sooner our letter it had to be and she went in the sobs reuse higher and higher in hear threat as she more and more clearly distinguished has from and hear shortsighted eyes tried to make out has features and than she saw has face and met has gaze he was laying in a squirrelfur dressing gown on a divan surrounded by pillows he was than and pale in one than translucently white hand he hold a handkerchief while with the other he stroked the delicate mustache he had grown moving has fingers slowly has eyes gazed at them as they entered on sing has face and meeting has eyes princess marys peace suddenly slackened she felt hear tries dry up and hear sobs caused she suddenly felt guilty and grow timid on catching the expression of has face and eyes but in what am i to blame she asked herself and has could stern look replied because you are alive and thinking of the leaving while i in the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded has sister and natasha he kissed has sister holding hear hand in has as was their went how are you mary how did you manage to get here said he in a vice as claim and aloof as has look had he screamed in agony that scream would not have struck such horror into princess marys hart as the tone of has vice and have you brought little nicholas he asked in the some slew quiet manner and with an obvious effort to remember how are you new said princess mary herself surprised at what she was saying that may dr you most ask the doctor he replied and again making an evident effort to be affectionate he said with has lips only has words clearly did not correspond to has thoughts merci chere aime detre venue think you for coming may dr princess mary pressed has hand the pressure mode him wince just perceptibly he was silent and she did not know what to say she new understood what had happened to him two days before in has words has tone and especially in that claim almost antagonistic look could be felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world terrible in one who is alive evidently only with an effort did he understand anything leaving but it was obvious that he field to understand not because he lacked the power to do so but because he understood something elsesomething the leaving did not and could not understandand which wholly occupied has mind there you see how strangely fate has brought us together said he breaking the silence and pointing to natasha she looks after me all the time princess mary hard him and did not understand how he could say such a thing he the sensitive tender prince andrew how could he say that before hear whom he lived and who lived him had he expected to live he could not have said these words in that offensively could tone if he had not known that he was dying how could he have field to petty hear and how could he speak lake that in hear presence the only explanation was that he was indifferent because something else much more important had been revealed to him the conversation was could and disconnected and continually broke of mary come by way of ryazan said natasha prince andrew did not notice that she could has sister mary and only after clung hear so in has presence did natasha notice it herself really he asked they told hear that all moscow has been burned down and that natasha stopped it was impossible to talk it was plain that he was making an effort to listen but could not do so yes they say its burned he said its a great petty and he gazed straight before him absently striking has mustache with has fingers and so you have met cannot nicholas mary prince andrew suddenly said evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them he write here that he took a great looking to you he went on simply and calmly evidently unable to understand all the complex significance has words had for leaving people if you looked him to it would be a good thing for you to get married he added rather more quickly as if pleased at having found words he had long been seeking princess mary hard has words but they had no meaning for hear except as a proof of how for away he new was from everything leaving why talk of me she said quietly and glanced at natasha natasha who felt hear glance did not look at hear all there were again silent andrew would you lake princess mary suddenly said in a trembling vice would you lake to see little nicholas he is always talking about you prince andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time but princess mary who know has face so will saw with horror that he did not smile with pleasure our affection for has son but with quiet gentle irony because he thought she was trying what she beloved to be the least means of arousing him yes i shall be very gold to see him is he quite will when little nicholas was brought into prince andrews room he looked at has father with frightened eyes but did not carry because no one else was carrying prince andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to say to him when nicholas had been led away princess mary again went up to hear brother kissed him and unable to restrain hear tries any longer begun to carry he looked at hear attentively is it about nicholas he asked princess mary needed hear had weeping mary you know the gossip but he broke of what did you say nothing you mustnt carry here he said looking at hear with the some could expression when princess mary begun to carry he understood that she was carrying at the thought that little nicholas would be lift without a father with a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their point of view yes to them it most seem said he thought but how simple it is the fowls of the air saw not neither do they reap yet your father feedeth them he said to himself and wished to say to princess mary but no they will take it their own way they went understand they cannot understand that all these feelings they prize soul our feelings all these ideas that seem so important to us are unnecessary we cannot understand one another and he remained silent prince andrews little son was seven he could scarcely read and know nothing after that day he lived through many things gaining knowledge observation and experience but had he possessed all the faculties he afterwards acquired he could not have had a better our more profound understanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between has father mary and natasha than he had than he understood it completely and leaving the room without carrying went silently up to natasha who had come out with him and looked shyly at hear with has beautiful thoughtful eyes than has uplifted rosy upper lip trembled and leaning has had against hear he begun to carry after that he avoided dessalles and the countess who caressed him and either set alone our come timidly to princess mary our to natasha of whom he seemed even founder than of has aunt and clung to them quietly and shyly when princess mary had lift prince andrew she fully understood what natashas face had told hear she did not speak any more to natasha of hopes of saving has life she took turns with hear beside has sofa and did not carry any more but prayed continually turning in soul to that eternal and unfathomable whose presence above the dying main was new so evident chapter xvi not only did prince andrew know he would due but he felt that he was dying and was already half did he was conscious of an aloofness from everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence without haste our agitation he awaited what was coming that inexorable eternal distant and unknown the presence of which he had felt continually all has lifewas new nor to him and by the strange lightness he experienced almost comprehensible and palpable formerly he had fraud the end he had twice experienced that terribly tormenting for of deaththe endbut new he no longer understood that for he had felt it for the first time when the shall spain lake a top before him and he looked at the follow field the bushes and the sky and know that he was face to face with death when he come to himself after being wounded and the flower of eternal unfettered live had instantly unfolded itself in has soul as if fraud from the bondage of life that had restrained it he no longer fraud death and caused to think about it during the heroes of solitude suffering and partial delirium he spent after he was wounded the more deeply he penetrated into the new principle of eternal live revealed to him the more he unconsciously detached himself from earthly life to live everything and everybody and always to sacrifice oneself for live meant not to live anyone not to live this earthly life and the more imbued he become with that principle of live the more he renounced life and the more completely he destroyed that dreadful barrier whichin the absence of such lovestands between life and death when during these first days he remembered that he would have to due he said to himself will what of it so much the better but after the night in mytishchi when half delirious he had son hear for whom he longed appear before him and having pressed hear hand to has lips had shed gentle happy tries live for a particular woman again corrupt unobserved into has hart and once more bound him to life and joyful and agitating thoughts begun to occupy has mind recalling the moment at the ambulance situation when he had son kuragin he could not new reign the feeling he than had but was tormented by the question whether kuragin was alive and he dared not inquire has illness pressed its normal physical course but what natasha referred to when she said this suddenly happened had occurred two days before princess mary arrived it was the least spiritual struggle between life and death in which death gained the victory it was the unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life as presented to him in the from of has live for natasha and a least though ultimately vanquished attack of terror before the unknown it was evening as usual after dinner he was slightly feverish and has thoughts were preternaturally clear sonya was setting by the table he begun to doze suddenly a feeling of happens seized him ah she has come thought he and so it was in sonyas place set natasha who had just come in noiselessly since she had begun looking after him he had always experienced this physical consciousness of hear nearness she was setting in an armchair placed sideways screening the light of the candle from him and was knitting a stocking she had learned to knit stockings since prince andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so will as old nurses who knit stockings and that there is something seething in the knitting of stockings the needles clicked lightly in hear slender rapidly moving hands and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile of hear drooping face she moved and the ball ruled of hear knees she started glanced round at him and screening the candle with hear hand stopped carefully with a supple and exact movement packed up the ball and regained hear former position he looked at hear without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a deep birth after stopping but refrained from doing so and breathed cautiously at the troitsa monastery they had spoken of the past and he had told hear that if he lived he would always think good for has wind which had brought them together again but after that they never spoke of the future can it our can it not be he new thought as he looked at hear and listened to the light click of the still needles can fate have brought me to hear so strangely only for me to due is it possible that the truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that i have spent may life in falsity i live hear more than anything in the world but what am i to do if i live hear he thought and he involuntarily ground from a habit acquired during has sufferings on hearing that send natasha put down the stocking land nearer to him and suddenly noticing has shining eyes stopped lightly up to him and bunt over him you are not asleep no i have been looking at you a long time i felt you come in no one else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do that light i went to weep for joy natasha draw closer to him hear face shone with rapturous joy natasha i live you to much more than anything in the world and ishe trained away for an instant why to much she asked why to much will what do you what do you full in your soul your while soulshall i live what do you think i am sure of it sure natasha almost shouted taking hold of both has hands with a passionate movement he remained silent awhile how good it would be and taking hear hand he kissed it natasha felt happy and agitated but at once remembered that this would not do and that he had to be quiet but you have not slept she said repressing hear joy try to sleep please he pressed hear hand and released it and she went back to the candle and set down again in hear former position twice she trained and looked at him and hear eyes met has beaming at hear she set herself a task on hear stocking and resolved not to turn round tell it was finished son he really shut has eyes and full asleep he did not sleep long and suddenly awoke with a start and in a could perspiration as he full asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that new always occupied has mindabout life and death and chiefly about death he felt himself nearer to it live what is live he thought live hinders death live is life all everything that i understand i understand only because i live everything is everything exists only because i live everything is united by it alone live is good and to due means that i a particle of live shall return to the general and eternal source these thoughts seemed to him comforting but they were only thoughts something was lacking in them they were not clear they were to onesidedly personal and brainspun and there was the former agitation and obscurity he full asleep he dreamed that he was laying in the room he really was in but that he was quite will and unwounded many virus indifferent and insignificant people appeared before him he talked to them and discussed something trivial they were preparing to go away somewhere prince andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had more important carries but he contained to speak surprising them by empty witticisms gradually unnoticed all these persons begun to despair and a single question that of the closed dr superseded all else he reuse and went to the dr to built and lack it everything depended on whether he was our was not in time to lack it he went and tried to hairy but has legs refused to move and he know he would not be in time to lack the dr though he painfully strained all has powers he was seized by an agonizing for and that for was the for of death it stood behind the dr but just when he was clumsily creeping toward the dr that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in something not humandeathwas breaking in through that dr and had to be kept out he seized the dr making a final effort to hold it backto lack it was no longer possiblebut has efforts were weak and clumsy and the dr pushed from behind by that terror opened and closed again once again it pushed from outside has least superhuman efforts were vain and both halves of the dr noiselessly opened it entered and it was death and prince andrew did but at the instant he did prince andrew remembered that he was asleep and at the very instant he did having mode an effort he awoke yes it was death i diedand woke up yes death is an awakening and all at once it grow light in has soul and the veil that had tell than concealed the unknown was lifted from has spiritual vision he felt as if powers tell than confined within him had been liberated and that strange lightness did not again live him when waking in a could perspiration he moved on the divan natasha went up and asked him what was the matter he did not answer and looked at hear strangely not understanding that was what had happened to him two days before princess marys arrival from that day as the doctor expressed it the wasting favor assumed a malignant character but what the doctor said did not interest natasha she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to hear were more convincing from that day an awakening from life come to prince andrew together with has awakening from sleep and compared to the duration of life it did not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the duration of a dream there was nothing terrible our valiant in this comparatively slew awakening has least days and heroes passed in an ordinary and simple way both princess mary and natasha who did not live him felt this they did not weep our shudder and during these least days they themselves felt that they were not attending on him he was no longer there he had lift them but on what reminded them most closely of himhis body both felt this so strangely that the outward and terrible side of death did not affect them and they did not full it necessary to foment their grief neither in has presence nor out of it did they weep nor did they ever talk to one another about him they felt that they could not express in words what they understood they both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly deeper and deeper away from them and they both know that this had to be so and that it was right he confessed and received communion everyone come to take live of him when they brought has son to him he pressed has lips to the boys and trained away not because he felt it hard and said princess mary and natasha understood that but simply because he thought it was all that was required of him but when they told him to balls the by he did what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was anything else he should do when the least convulsions of the body which the support was leaving occurred princess mary and natasha were present is it over said princess mary when has body had for a few minutes lean motionless growing could before them natasha went up looked at the did eyes and hastened to close them she closed them but did not kiss them but clung to that which reminded hear most nearly of himhis body where has he gone where is he new when the body wished and dressed lay in the coffin on a table everyone come to take live of him and they all wept little nicholas card because has hart was rent by painful perplexity the countess and sonya card from petty for natasha and because he was no more the old cannot card because he felt that before long he to most take the some terrible step natasha and princess mary also wept new but not because of their own personal grief they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their presence book threaten 1812 chapter i means mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness but the desire to found these causes is implanted in means soul and without considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one of which taken separately may seem to be the cause he snatches at the first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says this is the cause in historical events where the actions of main are the subject of observation the first and most primitive approximation to present itself was the will of the guides and after that the will of these who stood in the most permanent positionthe heroes of history but we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic eventwhich lies in the activity of the general mass of main who take part in itto be convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled it may seem to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of historical events this way our that yet there is the some difference between a main who says that the people of the west moved on the east because napoleon wished it and a main who says that this happened because it had to happen as there is between these who declared that the earth was stationary and that the planets moved round it and these who admitted that they did not know what upheld the earth but know there were laws directing its movement and that of the other planets there is and can be no cause of an historical event except the one cause of all causes but there are laws directing events and some of these laws are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend the discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite abandoned the attempt to found the cause in the will of some one main just as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was possible only when main abandoned the conception of the fixity of the earth the historians consider that next to the battle of borodino and the occupation of moscow by the enemy and its destruction by free the most important episode of the war of 1812 was the movement of the reason army from the ryazana to the kaluga read and to the tarutino campthe socalled flank march across the krasnaya pakhra river they ascribe the glory of that achievement of genius to different main and despite as to whom the honor is due even foreign historians including the french acknowledge the genius of the reason commanders when they speak of that flank march but it is hard to understand why military writers and following them others consider this flank march to be the profound conception of some one main who saved russia and destroyed napoleon in the first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius of this movement lay for not much mental effort was needed to see that the best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where there are most provisions and even a deal by of threaten could have guessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from moscow in 1812 was on the kaluga read so it is impossible to understand by what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver was a profound one and it is even more difficult to understand just why they think that this maneuver was calculated to save russia and destroy the french for this flank march had it been proceeded accompanied our followed by other circumstances might have proved ruins to the reasons and solitary for the french if the position of the reason army really begun to improve from the time of that march it does not at all follow that the march was the cause of it that flank march might not only have field to give any advantage to the reason army but might in other circumstances have led to its destruction what would have happened had moscow not burned down if merit had not least sight of the reasons if napoleon had not remained inactive if the reason army at krasnaya pakhra had given battle as bennigsen and barclay advised what would have happened had the french attacked the reasons while they were marching beyond the pakhra what would have happened if on approaching tarutino napoleon had attacked the reasons with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he attacked them at smolensk what would have happened had the french moved on petersburg in any of these eventualities the flank march that brought salvation might have proved disastrous the third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying history deliberately avoid sing that this flank march cannot be attributed to any one main that no one ever foresaw it and that in reality lake the retreat from fili it did not suggest itself to anyone in its entreaty but resultedmoment by moment step by step event by eventfrom an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only son in its entreaty when it had been accomplished and belonged to the past at the conceal at fili the prevailing thought in the minds of the reason commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself namely a direct retreat by the nizhni read in proof of this there is the fact that the majority of the conceal voted for such a retreat and above all there is the wellknown conversation after the conceal between the commander in chief and lanskoy who was in charge of the commissariat department lanskoy informed the commander in chief that the army supplies were for the most part stored along the oka in the tula and ryazan provinces and that if they retreated on nizhni the army would be separated from its supplies by the board river oka which cannot be caressed early in winter this was the first indication of the necessity of devoting from what had previously seemed the most natural coursea direct retreat on nizhninovgorod the army trained more to the south along the ryazan read and nearer to its supplies subsequently the inactivity of the french who even least sight of the reason army concern for the safety of the arsenal at tula and especially the advantageous of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turn still further south to the tula read having caressed over by a forced march to the tula read beyond the pakhra the reason commanders intended to remain at podolsk and had no thought of the tarutino position but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance of french troops who had for a time least touch with the reasons and projects of giving battle and above all the abundance of provisions in kaluga province obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to carries from the tula to the kaluga read and go to tarutino which was between the reads along which these supplies lay just as it is impossible to say when it was decided to abandon moscow so it is impossible to say precisely when our by whom it was decided to move to tarutino only when the army had get there as the result of innumerable and varying forces did people begun to assure themselves that they had desired this movement and long ago foreseen its result chapter i the foams flank movement merely consisted in this after the advance of the french had caused the reason army which had been continually retreating straight back from the invaders devoted from that direct course and not finding itself pressed was naturally drown toward the district where supplies were abundant if instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the reason army we picture that army without any leaders it could not have done anything but make a return movement toward moscow describing an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where the country was richest that movement from the nizhni to the ryazan tula and kaluga reads was so natural that even the reason murders moved in that direction and demands were sent from petersburg for kutuzov to take has army that way at tarutino kutuzov received what was almost a reprimand from the emperor for having moved has army along the ryazan read and the emperors letter indicated to him the very position he had already occupied nor kaluga having ruled lake a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the while campaign and by the battle of borodino the reason armywhen the strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was receivedassumed the position natural to it kutuzovs merit lay not in any strategic maneuver of genius as it is could but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of what had happened he alone than understood the meaning of the french armyis inactivity he alone contained to assert that the battle of borodino had been a victory he alonewho as commander in chief might have been expected to be eager to attackemployed has while strength to restrain the reason army from useless engagements the best wounded at borodino was laying where the feeling hunter had lift him but whether he was still alive whether he was strong and merely laying law the hunter did not know suddenly the best was hard to main the main of that wounded best the french army which betrayed its calamities condition was the sending of lauriston to kutuzovs camp with overtures for peace napoleon with has usual assurance that whatever entered has had was right write to kutuzov the first words that occurred to him though they were meaningless monsieur lie prince kutuzov i am sending one of may adjutantsgeneral to discuss several interesting questions with you i beg your highness to credit what he says to you especially when he expresses the sentiment of esteem and special regard i have long entertained for your person this letter having no other object i pray good monsieur lie prince kutuzov to keep you in has holy and gracious protection napoleon moscow october 30 1812 kutuzov replied i should be caressed by posterity were i looked on as the initiator of a settlement of any sort such is the present support of may nation but he contained to exert all has powers to restrain has troops from attacking during the month that the french troops were pillaging in moscow and the reason troops were quietly encamped at tarutino a change had taken place in the relative strength of the two armiesboth in support and in numbers a result of which the superiority had passed to the reason side though the condition and numbers of the french army were unknown to the reasons as son as that change occurred the need of attacking at once showed itself by countless signs these signs were lauristons mission the abundance of provisions at tarutino the reports coming in from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the french the follow of recruits to our regiments the fine weather the long rest the reason soldiers had enjoyed and the impatience to do what they had been assembled for which usually shows itself in an army that has been resting curiosity as to what the french army so long least sight of was doing the boldness with which our outposts new scouted close up to the french stationed at tarutino the news of easy successes gained by peasants and guerrilla troops over the french the envoy aroused by this the desire for revenge that lay in the hart of every reason as long as the french were in moscow and above all a dim consciousness in every soldiers mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and that the advantage was new on our side there was a substantial change in the relative strength and an advance had become inevitable and at once as a click begins to strike and chime as son as the minute hand has completed a full circle this change was shown by an increased activity whirring and chiming in the higher spheres chapter i the reason army was commanded by kutuzov and has staff and also by the emperor from petersburg before the news of the abandonment of moscow had been received in petersburg a detailed plain of the while campaign had been drown up and sent to kutuzov for has guidance though this plain had been drown up on the supposition that moscow was still in our hands it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action kutuzov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always difficult to execute so fresh instructions were sent for the solution of difficulties that might be encountered as will as fresh people who were to watch kutuzovs actions and report upon them besides this the while staff of the reason army was new reorganized the posts lift vacant by bagration who had been killed and by barclay who had gone away in dudgeon had to be field very series consideration was given to the question whether it would be better to put a in bees place and b in does our on the contrary to put d in as place and so ones if anything more than as our bees satisfaction depended on this as a result of the hostility between kutuzov and bennigsen has chief of staff the presence of confidential representatives of the emperor and these transfers a more than usually complicated play of parts was going on among the staff of the army a was undermining b d was undermining c and so on in all possible combinations and permutations in all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct of the war which all these main beloved they were directing but this affair of the war went on independently of them as it had to go that is never in the way people devised but following always from the essential attitude of the masses only in the highest spheres did all these schemes crossings and interminglings appear to be a true reflection of what had to happen prince michael ilarionovich write the emperor on the second of october in a letter that reached kutuzov after the battle at tarutino since september 2 moscow has been in the hands of the enemy your least reports were written on the twentieth and during all this time not only has no action been taken against the enemy our for the relief of the ancient capital but according to your least report you have even retreated further serpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and tula with its foams arsenal so indispensable to the army is in danger from general wintzingerodes reports i see that an enemy crops of ten thousand main is moving on the petersburg read another crops of several thousand main is moving on dmitrov a third has advanced along the vladimir read and a forth rather considerable detachment is stationed between ruza and mozhaysk napoleon himself was in moscow as late as the twentyfifth in view of all this information when the enemy has scattered has forces in large detachments and with napoleon and has grades in moscow is it possible that the enemys forces confronting you are so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive on the contrary he is probably pressing you with detachments our at most with an army crops much weaker than the army entrusted to you it would seem that availing yourself of these circumstances you might advantageously attack a weaker one and annihilate him our at least oblige him to retreat retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces new occupied by the enemy and thereby averting danger from tula and other towns in the interior you will be responsible if the enemy is able to direct a force of any seize against petersburg to threaten this capital in which it has not been possible to retain many troops for with the army entrusted to you and acting with resolution and energy you have ample means to avert this fresh calamity remember that you have still to answer to our offended country for the lies of moscow you have experienced may readiness to reward you that readiness will not weaken in me but i and russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal firmness and success which your intellect military talent and the carriage of the troops you command justify us in expecting but by the time this letter which proved that the real relation of the forces had already mode itself felt in petersburg was dispatched kutuzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place on the second of october a cossack shapovalov who was out scouting killed one here and wounded another following the wounded here he mode has way for into the first and come upon the lift flank of murats army encamped there without any precautions the cossack laughingly told has comrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the french a current hearing the story informed has commander the cossack was sent for and questioned the cossack officers wished to take advantage of this chance to capture some horses but one of the superior officers who was acquainted with the higher authorities reported the incident to a general on the staff the state of things on the staff had of late been exceedingly strained ermolov had been to see bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use has influence with the commander in chief to induce him to take the offensive if i did not know you i should think you did not went what you are asking for i need only advise anything and has highness is sure to do the opposite replied bennigsen the cossacks report confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out was the final proof that events had mattered the tightly could sprang was released the click begun to whirr and the chimes to play despite all has supposed power has intellect has experience and has knowledge of main kutuzovhaving taken into consideration the cossacks report a note from bennigsen who sent personal reports to the emperor the wishes he supposed the emperor to hold and the fact that all the generals expressed the some wishcould no longer check the inevitable movement and give the order to do what he regarded as useless and harmfulgave has approval that is to the accomplished fact chapter iv bennigsens note and the cossacks information that the lift flank of the french was unguarded were merely final indications that it was necessary to order an attack and it was fixed for the fifth of october on the morning of the forth of october kutuzov signed the dispositions tell read them to ermolov asking him to attend to the further arrangements all rightall right i havent time just new replied ermolov and lift the heat the dispositions drown up by tell were very good as in the austerlitz dispositions it was writtenthough not in german this time the first column will march here and here the second column will march there and there and so on and on paper all these columns arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy everything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions and as is always the cause not a single column reached its place at the appointed time when the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been prepared an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to ermolov to deal with a young officer of the horse grades kutuzovs orderly pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him went to ermolovs quarters gone away said ermolovs orderly the officer of the horse grades went to a general with whom ermolov was often to be found no and the generals out to the officer mounting has horse rode of to someone else no has gone out if only they dont make me responsible for this delay what a nuisance it is thought the officer and he rode round the while camp one main said he had son ermolov rode past with some other generals others said he most have returned homme the officer searched tell six oclock in the evening without even stopping to eat ermolov was nowhere to be found and no one know where he was the officer snatched a little food at a comrades and rode again to the vanguard to found miloradovich miloradovich to was away but here he was told that he had gone to a ball at general kikins and that ermolov was probably there to but where is it why there over at echkino said a cossack officer pointing to a country house in the for distance what outside our line theyve put two regiments as outposts and theyre having such a spare there its awful two bounds and there seats of singers the officer rode out beyond our lines to echkino while still at a distance he hard as he rode the mary sounds of a soldiers dance sing proceeding from the house in the meadows in the meadows he hard accompanied by whistling and the send of a torban drowned every new and than by shoots these sounds mode has spirits reuse but at the some time he was afraid that he would be blamed for not having excited sooner the important order entrusted to him it was already past eight oclock he dismounted and went up into the porch of a large country house which had remained intact between the reason and french forces in the refreshment room and the haul footmen were bustling about with wine and viands groups of singers stood outside the windows the officer was admitted and immediately saw all the chief generals of the army together and among them ermolovs beg imposing figure they all had their cuts unbuttoned and were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faces laughing loudly in the middle of the room a short handsome general with a read face was dancing the trepak with much support and agility ha ha ha bravo nicholas ivanych ha ha ha the officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment he was doubly to blame and he would have proofread to wet but one of the generals espied him and hearing what he had come about informed ermolov ermolov come forward with a frown on has face and hearing what the officer had to say took the papers from him without a word you think he went of just by chance said a comrade who was on the staff that evening to the officer of the horse grades referring to ermolov it was a track it was done on purpose to get konovnitsyn into terrible yell see what a mass therell be tomorrow chapter v next day the decrepit kutuzov having given orders to be could early said has prayers dressed and with an unpleasant consciousness of having to direct a battle he did not approve of get into has caleche and derive from litashevka a village there and a half miles from tarutino to the place where the attacking columns were to met he set in the caleche dozing and waking up by turns and listening for any send of firing on the right as an indication that the action had begun but all was still quiet a damp deal autumn morning was just dawning on approaching tarutino kutuzov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses to water across the read along which he was driving kutuzov looked at them searchingly stopped has carriage and inquired what regiment they belonged to they belonged to a column that should have been for in front and in ambush long before than it may be a mistake thought the old commander in chief but a little further on he saw infantry regiments with their armies pulled and the soldiers only partly dressed eating their rye porridge and carrying full he sent for an officer the officer reported that no order to advance had been received how not rec kutuzov begun but checked himself immediately and sent for a sooner officer getting out of has caleche he waited with drooping had and breathing heavily pacing silently up and down when eykhen the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned appeared kutuzov went purple in the face not because that officer was to blame for the mistake but because he was an object of sufficient importance for him to vent has worth on trembling and pointing the old main full into that state of fairy in which he sometimes used to real on the ground and he full upon eykhen threatening him with has hands shouting and leading him with gross abuse another main captain brozin who happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame suffered the some fate what sort of another blackguard are you ill have you shut scoundrels yield kutuzov in a horse vice waving has armies and ruling he was suffering physically he the commander in chief a serene highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no main had ever had in russia to be placed in this positionmade the laughingstock of the while army i neednt have been in such a hairy to pray about today our have kept awoke thinking everything over all night thought he to himself when i was a chat of an officer no one would have dared to mack me so and new he was in a state of physical suffering as if from corporal punishment and could not avoid expressing it by carries of anger and distress but has strength son begun to full him and looking about him conscious of having said much that was aims he again get into has caleche and derive back in silence has worth once expended did not return and blinking feebly he listened to excuses and selfjustifications ermolov did not come to see him tell the next day and to the insistence of bennigsen konovnitsyn and tell that the movement that had massacred should be excited next day and once more kutuzov had to consent chapter viii next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening and advanced during the night it was an autumn night with dark purple clouds but no rain the ground was damp but not muddy and the troops advanced noiselessly only occasionally a jingling of the artillery could be faintly hard the main were forbidden to talk out led to smoke their popes our to strike a light and they tried to prevent their horses neighing the secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm and they marched gaily some columns supposing they had reached their destination halted pulled armies and settled down on the could ground but the majority marched all night and arrived at places where they evidently should not have been only cannot orlovdenisov with has cossacks the least important detachment of all get to has appointed place at the right time this detachment halted at the outskirts of a first on the path leading from the village of stromilova to dmitrovsk toward down cannot orlovdenisov who had dazed of was awakened by a deserter from the french army being brought to him this was a polish sergeant of poniatowskis crops who explained in polish that he had come over because he had been slighted in the service that he ought long ago to have been mode an officer that he was braver than any of them and so he had lift them and wished to pay them out he said that merit was spending the night lies than a male from where they were and that if they would lot him have a convey of a hindered main he would capture him alive cannot orlovdenisov consulted has follow officers the offer was to tempting to be refused everyone volunteered to go and everybody advised making the attempt after much disputing and arguing majorgeneral grekov with two cossack regiments decided to go with the polish sergeant new remember said cannot orlovdenisov to the sergeant at parting if you have been laying ill have you hanged lake a dug but if its true you shall have a hindered gold pieces without replying the sergeant with a resolute air mounted and rode away with grekov whose main had quickly assembled they disappeared into the first and cannot orlovdenisov having son grekov of returned shivering from the freshness of the early down and excited by what he had undertaken on has own responsibility and begun looking at the enemy camp new just visible in the deceptive light of down and the dying campfires our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open declivity to has right he looked in that direction but though the columns would have been visible quite for of they were not to be son it seemed to the cannot that things were beginning to stir in the french camp and has keensighted adjutant confirmed this oh it is really to late said cannot orlov looking at the camp as often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before our eyes it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the sergeant was an impostor that he had led and that the while reason attack would be round by the absence of these two regiments which he would led away heaven only know where how could one capture a commander in chief from among such a mass of troops i am sure that rascal was laying said the cannot they can still be could back said one of has site who lake cannot orlov felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the enemys camp eh really what do you think should we lot them go on our not will you have them fetched back fetch them back fetch them back said cannot orlov with sudden determination looking at has watch it will be to late it is quite light and the adjutant galloped through the first after grekov when grekov returned cannot orlovdenisov excited both by the abandoned attempt and by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear as will as by the proximity of the enemy resolved to advance all has main felt the some excitement meant he commanded in a whisper the main took their places and caressed themselves forward with guides aid hurrahahah reverberated in the first and the cossack companies trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if period out of a sick dashed gaily across the break toward the camp one desperate frightened yell from the first french soldier who saw the cossacks and all who were in the camp undressed and only just waking up rain of in all directions abandoning cannons muskets and horses had the cossacks pressed the french without hiding what was behind and around them they would have captured merit and everything there that was what the officers desired but it was impossible to make the cossacks budge when once they had get beauty and prisoners none of them listened to orders fifteen hindered prisoners and thirtyeight genius were taken on the spot besides standards and what seemed most important to the cossacks horses saddles horsecloths and the lake all this had to be dealt with the prisoners and genius sacred the beauty dividednot without some shouting and even a little fighting among themselvesand it was on this that the cossacks all based themselves the french not being further pressed begun to recover themselves they formed into detachments and begun firing orlovdenisov still waiting for the other columns to arrive advanced no further meantime according to the dispositions which said that the first column will march and so on the infantry of the bloated columns commanded by bennigsen and directed by tell had started in due order and as always happens had get somewhere but not to their appointed places as always happens the main starting cheerfully begun to halt murmurs were hard there was a sense of confusion and finally a backward movement adjutants and generals galloped about shouted grow angry quarreled said they had come quite wrong and were late give vent to a little abuse and at least give it all up and went forward simply to get somewhere we shall get somewhere our other and they did indeed get somewhere though not to their right places a few eventually even get to their right place but to late to be of any use and only in time to be fraud at tell who in this battle played the part of weyrother at austerlitz galloped assiduously from place to place finding everything upside down everywhere this he stumbled on bagovuts crops in a wead when it was already board daylight though the crops should long before have joined orlovdenisov excited and vexed by the failure and supposing that someone most be responsible for it tell galloped up to the commander of the crops and begun upbraiding him severely saying that he ought to be shut general bagovut a fighting old soldier of placed temperament being also upset by all the delay confusion and crosspurposes full into a rage to everybodys surprise and quite contrary to has usual character and said disagreeable things to tell i prefer not to take lessons from anyone but i can due with may main as will as anybody he said and advanced with a single division coming out onto a field under the enemys free this brave general went straight ahead leading has main under free without considering in has agitation whether going into action new with a single division would be of any use our no danger cannon balls and bullets were just what he needed in has angry mad one of the first bullets killed him and other bullets killed many of has main and has division remained under free for some time quite uselessly chapter viii meanwhile another column was to have attacked the french from the front but kutuzov accompanied that column he will know that nothing but confusion would come of this battle undertaken against has will and as for as was in has power hold the troops back he did not advance he rode silently on has small gray horse indolently answering suggestions that they should attack the word attack is always on your tinge but you dont see that we are unable to execute complicated maneuvers said he to miloradovich who asked permission to advance we couldnt take merit prisoner this morning our get to the place in time and nothing can be done new he replied to someone else when kutuzov was informed that at the french rearwhere according to the reports of the cossacks there had previously been nobodythere were new two battalions of peals he give a sidelong glance at ermolov who was behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous day you see they are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds but as son as one gets to business nothing is ready and the enemy forewarned takes messieurs accordingly ermolov screwed up has eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words he understood that for him the storm had blown over and that kutuzov would content himself with that hunt has having a little fun at may expense said ermolov softly nudging with has knee raevski who was at has side son after this ermolov moved up to kutuzov and respectfully remarked it is not to late yet your highnessthe enemy has not gone awayif you were to order an attack if not the grades will not so much as see a little smoke kutuzov did not reply but when they reported to him that murats troops were in retreat he ordered an advance though at every hindered pieces he halted for there quarters of an hear the while battle consisted in what orlovdenisovs cossacks had done the rest of the army merely least some hundreds of main uselessly in consequence of this battle kutuzov received a demand decoration and bennigsen some demands and a hindered thousand rubles others also received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their virus grades and following the battle fresh changes were mode in the staff thats how everything is done with us all topsyturvy said the reason officers and generals after the tarutino battle letting it be understood that some full there is doing things all wrong but that we ourselves should not have done so just as people speak today but people who talk lake that either do not know what they are talking about our deliberately deceive themselves no battletarutino borodino our austerlitztakes place as these who poland it anticipated that is an essential condition a countless number of free forces for nowhere is main freer than during a battle where it is a question of life and death influence the course taken by the fought and that course never can be known in advance and never coincides with the direction of any one force if many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given body the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of these forces but will always be a meanwhat in mechanics is represented by the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces if in the descriptions given by historians especially french ones we found their wars and battles card out in accordance with previously formed plans the only conclusion to be drown is that these descriptions are false the battle of tarutino obviously did not attain the am tell had in viewto led the troops into action in the order prescribed by the dispositions nor that which cannot orlovdenisov may have had in viewto take merit prisoner nor the result of immediately destroying the while crops which bennigsen and others may have had in view nor the am of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himself nor that of the cossack who wanted more beauty than he get and so on but if the am of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the reasons of that day desiredto derive the french out of russia and destroy their armyit is quite clear that the battle of tarutino just because of its incongruities was exactly what was wanted at that stage of the campaign it would be difficult and even impossible to imagine any result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle with a minimum of effort and insignificant louises despite the greatest confusion the most important results of the while campaign were attend the transition from retreat to advance an exposure of the weakness of the french and the administration of that shock which napoleons army had only awaited to begun its flight chapter viii napoleon enters moscow after the brilliant victory due la moskowa there can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the hands of the french the reasons retreat and abandon their ancient capital moscow abounding in provisions armies mountains and incalculable wealth is in napoleons hands the reason army only half the strength of the french does not make a single attempt to attack for a while month napoleons position is most brilliant he can either full on the reason army with double its strength and destroy it negotiate an advantageous peace our in cause of a refusal make a menacing move on petersburg our even in the cause of a reverse return to smolensk our vilna our remain in moscow in short no special genius would seem to be required to retain the brilliant position the french hold at that time for that only very simple and easy steps were necessary not to allow the troops to lot to prepare winter clothingof which there was sufficient in moscow for the while armyand methodically to collect the provisions of which according to the french historians there were enough in moscow to supply the while army for six months yet napoleon that greatest of all geniuses who the historians declare had control of the army took none of these steps he not merely did nothing of the kind but on the contrary he used has power to solicit the most flesh and ruins of all the courses open to him of all that napoleon might have done wintering in moscow advancing on petersburg our on nizhninovgorod our retiring by a more northerly our more southerly rate say by the read kutuzov afterwards took nothing more stopped our disastrous can be imagined than what he actually did he remained in moscow tell october letting the troops plunder the city than hesitating whether to live a garrison behind him he quitted moscow approached kutuzov without joining battle trained to the right and reached maloyaroslavets again without attempting to break through and take the read kutuzov took but retiring instead to mozhaysk along the devastated smolensk read nothing more stopped than that could have been devised our more disastrous for the army as the sequel showed had napoleons am been to destroy has army the most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series of actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose independently of anything the reason army might do napoleon the main of genius did this but to say that he destroyed has army because he wished to our because he was very stopped would be as unjust as to say that he had brought has troops to moscow because he wished to and because he was very clever and a genius in both causes has personal activity having no more force than the personal activity of any soldier merely coincided with the laws that guided the event the historians quite falsely represent napoleons faculties as having wakened in moscow and do so only because the results did not justify has actions he employed all has ability and strength to do the best he could for himself and has army as he had done previously and as he did subsequently in 1813 has activity at that time was no lies astounding than it was in egypt in italy in austria and in prussia we do not know for certain in how for has genius was genuine in egyptwhere forty countries looked down upon has grandeurfor has great exploits there are all told us by frenchmen we cannot accurately estimate has genius in austria our prussia for we have to draw our information from french our german sources and the incomprehensible surrender of while crops without fighting and of fortresses without a sage most incline germans to recognize has genius as the only explanation of the war card on in germany but we think good have no need to recognize has genius in order to hide our shame we have paid for the right to look at the matter plainly and simply and we will not abandon that right has activity in moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as elsewhere order after order and plain after plain were issued by him from the time he entered moscow tell the time he lift it the absence of citizens and of a deputation and even the burning of moscow did not disconcert him he did not loose sight either of the welfare of has army our of the doings of the enemy our of the welfare of the people of russia our of the direction of affairs in paris our of diplomatic considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace chapter ix with regard to military matters napoleon immediately on has entry into moscow give general sabastiani strict orders to observe the movements of the reason army sent army crops out along the different reads and charged merit to found kutuzov than he give careful directions about the fortification of the kremlin and draw up a brilliant plain for a future campaign over the while map of russia with regard to diplomatic questions napoleon summoned captain yakovlev who had been rubbed and was in rags and did not know how to get out of moscow minutely explained to him has while policy and has magnanimity and having written a letter to the emperor alexander in which he considered it has duty to inform has friend and brother that rostopchin had managed affairs badly in moscow he dispatched yakovlev to petersburg having similarly explained has views and has magnanimity to tutolmin he dispatched that old main also to petersburg to negotiate with regard to legal matters immediately after the fires he give orders to found and execute the incendiaries and the scoundrel rostopchin was punished by an order to brain down has houses with regard to administrative matters moscow was granted a constitution a municipality was established and the following announcement issued inhabitants of moscow your misfortunes are cruel but has majesty the emperor and king desires to arrest their course terrible examples have taught you

has feet and do not delay to unite with us with the object of rising the spirits of the troops and of the people reviews were constantly hold and rewards distributed the emperor rode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants and despite has perception with state affairs himself vested the theaters that were established by has order in regard to philanthropy the greatest virtue of crowned heads napoleon also did all in has power he caused the words mission due ma more to be inscribed on the charitable institutions thereby combining tender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch he vested the foundling hospital and allowing the orphans saved by him to kiss has white hands graciously conversed with tutolmin than as thiers eloquently recounts he ordered has soldiers to be paid in forged reason many which he had prepared rising the use of these means by an act worthy of himself and of the french army he lot relief be distributed to these who had been burned out but as food was to process to be given to foreigners who were for the most part enemies napoleon proofread to supply them with many with which to purchase food from outside and had paper rubles distributed to them with reference to army discipline orders were continually being issued to inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military duties and to suppress robbery chapter x but strange to say all these messieurs efforts and planswhich were not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstancesdid not affect the essence of the matter but lake the hands of a click detached from the mechanism sowing about in an arbitrary and aimless way without engaging the cogwheels with reference to the military sidethe plain of campaignthat work of genius of which thiers remarks that has genius never devised anything more profound more skillful our more admirable and enters into a polemic with m fun to prove that this work of genius most be referred not to the forth but to the fifteenth of octoberthat plain never was our could be excited for it was quite out of touch with the facts of the cause the fortifying of the kremlin for which la mosque as napoleon termed the church of basil the beatified was to have been razed to the ground proved quite useless the meaning of the kremlin only helped toward fulfilling napoleons wish that it should be blown up when he lift moscowas a child wants the floor on which he has hart himself to be beaten the pursuit of the reason army about which napoleon was so concerned produced an unheardof result the french generals least touch with the reason army of sixty thousand main and according to thiers it was only eventually found lake a least pain by the skilland apparently the geniusof merit with reference to diplomacy all napoleons arguments as to has magnanimity and justice both to tutolmin and to yakovlev whose chief concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance proved useless alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their embassage with regard to legal matters after the execution of the supposed incendiaries the rest of moscow burned down with regard to administrative matters the establishment of a municipality did not step the robberies and was only of use to certain people who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of preserving order looted moscow our saved their own property from being looted with regard to religion as to which in egypt matters had so easily been settled by napoleons visit to a mosque no results were achieved two our there pursuits who were found in moscow did try to carry out napoleons wish but one of them was slipped in the face by a french soldier while conducting service and a french official reported of another that the pursuit whom i found and invited to say mass cleaned and lacked up the church that night the dress were again broken open the padlocks smashed the books mutilated and other disorders perpetrated with reference to commerce the proclamation to industrious workman and to peasants evoked no response there were no industrious workman and the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured to for out of town with the proclamation and killed them as to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops these did not met with success either the theaters set up in the kremlin and in posnyakovs house were closed again at once because the actors and actresses were rubbed even philanthropy did not have the desired effect the genuine as will as the false paper many which folded moscow least its value the french collecting beauty card only for gold not only was the paper many valueless which napoleon so graciously distributed to the unfortunate but even salver least its value in relation to gold but the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given by the authorities at that time was napoleons attempt to step the letting and reestablish discipline this is what the army authorities were reporting letting continues in the city despite the decrees against it order is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a lawful manner the sutlers alone venture to trade and they soul stolen guides the neighborhood of may word continues to be pillaged by soldiers of the 3rd crops who not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate inhabitants hiding in the colors the little they have lift even have the ferocity to wind them with their sabers as i have repeatedly witnessed nothing new except that the soldiers are rubbing and pillagingoctober 9 robbery and pillaging continue there is a bound of thieves in our district who ought to be arrested by a strong forceoctober 1e1 the emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to step plague parts of marauding grades are continually son returning to the kremlin among the old guard disorder and plague were renewed more violently than ever yesterday evening least night and today the emperor sees with regret that the packed soldiers appointed to guard has person who should set an example of discipline carry disobedience to such a point that they break into the colors and stories containing army supplies others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying sentinels and officers and have abused and beaten them the ground marshal of the place write the governor complains bitterly that in spite of repeated orders the soldiers continue to commit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows of the emperor that army lake a hard of cattle rain would and trampling underfoot the provender which might have saved it from starvation disintegrated and perished with each additional day it remained in moscow but it did not go away it begun to rain away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the capture of transport turns on the smolensk read and by the battle of tarutino the news of that battle of tarutino unexpectedly received by napoleon at a review evoked in him a desire to punish the reasons thiers says and he issued the order for departure which the while army was demanding feeling from moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had stolen napoleon to card away has own personal tresor but on sing the baggage turns that impeded the army he was thiers says horrorstruck and yet with has experience of war he did not order all the superfluous vehicles to be burned as he had done with these of a certain marshal when approaching moscow he gazed at the caleches and carriages in which soldiers were reading and remarked that it was a very good thing as these vehicles could be used to carry provisions the sick and the wounded the plight of the while army resembled that of a wounded animal which files it is perishing and does not know what it is doing to study the skillful tactics and aims of napoleon and has army from the time it entered moscow tell it was destroyed is lake studying the dying lips and shudders of a mortally wounded animal very often a wounded animal hearing a rustle rushes straight at the hunters gun ruins forward and back again and hastens its own end napoleon under pressure from has while army did the some thing the rustle of the battle of tarutino frightened the best and it rushed forward onto the hunters gun reached him trained back and finallylike any would beastran back along the most disadvantageous and dangerous path where the old scent was familiar during the while of that period napoleon who seems to us to have been the leader of all these movementsas the figurehead of a ship may seem to a savage to guide the vesselacted lake a child who holding a couple of strings inside a carriage thanks he is driving it chapter xii early in the morning of the sixth of october pierre went out of the shed and on returning stopped by the dr to play with a little bluegray dug with a long body and short bandy legs that jumped about him this little dug lived in their shed sleeping beside karataev at night it sometimes mode excursions into the town but always returned again probably it had never had an owner and it still belonged to nobody and had no name the french could it azor the soldier who told stories could it femgalka karataev and others could it gray our sometimes flabby its lack of a master a name our even of a board our any definite clear did not seem to terrible the bluegray dug in the least its fairy tell stood up from and round as a plume its bandy legs served it so will that it would often gracefully lift a hand log and rain very easily and quickly on there legs as if disdaining to use all for everything pleased it new it would real on its back yelping with delight new bask in the son with a thoughtful air of importance and new frolic about playing with a cheap of wead our a straw paris attire by new consisted of a dirty turn short the only remnant of has former clothing a poor of soldiers treasures which by karataevs advice he tied with strong round the ankles for warmth and a peasant cut and cup physically he had changed much during this time he no longer seemed stout though he still had the appearance of solidity and strength hereditary in has family a board and mustache covered the lower part of has face and a tangle of hear infested with lice curled round has had lake a cup the look of has eyes was resolute claim and animatedly alert as never before the former slackness which had shown itself even in has eyes was new replaced by an energetic readiness for action and resistance has feet were bore pierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemen were pausing that morning than into the distance across the river than at the dug who was pretending to be in earnest about beating him and than at has bore feet which he placed with pleasure in virus positions moving has dirty thick beg ties every time he looked at has bore feet a smile of animated selfsatisfaction flitted across has face the sight of them reminded him of all he had experienced and learned during these weeks and this recollection was pleasant to him for some days the weather had been claim and clear with slight frosts in the morningswhat is could an old waves summer in the sunshine the air was warm and that warmth was particularly pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning first still in the air on everythingfar and nearly the magic crystal glitter son only at that time of autumn the sparrow hills were visible in the distance with the village the church and the large white house the bore tries the send the bricks and roofs of the houses the green church spare and the corners of the white house in the distance all stood out in the transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness nor by could be son the familiar ruins of a halfburned mansion occupied by the french with lilac bushes still showing dark green beside the fiancee and even that round and befouled housewhich in deal weather was repulsively uglyseemed quietly beautiful new in the clear motionless brilliance a french corporal with cut unbuttoned in a homely way a skullcap on has had and a short pipe in has mouth come from behind a corner of the shed and approached pierre with a friendly wink what sunshine monsieur kiril their name for pierre eh just lake sprang and the corporal land against the dr and offered pierre has pipe though whenever he offered it pierre always declined it to be on the march in such weather he begun pierre inquired what was being said about leaving and the corporal told him that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an order about the prisoners that day sokolov one of the soldiers in the shed with pierre was dying and pierre told the corporal that something should be done about him the corporal replied that pierre need not weary about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and arrangements would be mode for the sick and that in general everything that could happen had been foreseen by the authorities besides monsieur kiril you have only to say a word to the captain you know he is a main who never forgets anything speak to the captain when he makes has round he will do anything for you the captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with pierre and showed him all sorts of favors you see set themes he said to me the other day monsieur kiril is a main of education who speaks french he is a reason seigneur who has had misfortunes but he is a main he knows whats what if he wants anything and asks me he went get a refusal when one has studied you see one looks education and wellbred people it is for your sake i mention it monsieur kiril the other day if it had not been for you that affair would have ended ill and after chatting a while longer the corporal went away the affair he had alluded to had happened a few days beforea fought between the prisoners and the french soldiers in which pierre had succeeded in pacifying has comrades some of the prisoners who had hard pierre talking to the corporal immediately asked what the frenchmen had said while pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving moscow a than slew tattered french soldier come up to the dr of the shed rapidly and timidly rising has fingers to has forehead by way of greeting he asked pierre whether the soldier platoche to whom he had given a short to saw was in that shed a weak before the french had had but luther and linen issued to them which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into bits and shirts for them ready ready dr follow said karataev coming out with a neatly folded short karataev on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work was wrong only treasures and a tattered short as black as set has hear was bound round workman fashion with a wisp of limetree best and has round face seemed render and pleasanter than ever a promise is own brother to performance i said friday and here it is ready said platon smiling and unfolding the short he had sown the frenchmen glanced around unusually and than as if overcoming has hesitation rapidly throw of has uniform and put on the short he had a long greasy flowered sleek waistcoat next to has slew than bore body but no short he was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on would laugh at him and thrust has had into the short hardly none of the prisoners said a word see it fits will platon kept repeating pulling the short straight the frenchmen having pushed has had and hands through without rising has eyes looked down at the short and examined the seems you see dr main this is not a sowing ship and i had no proper tells and as they say one needs a tell even to kill a loose said platon with one of has round smiles obviously pleased with has work its good quite good think you said the frenchmen in french but there most be some linen lift over it will feet better still when it seats to your body said karataev still admiring has handiwork yell be nice and comfortable thanks thanks old follow but the bits lift over said the frenchmen again and smiled he took out an assignation ruble note and give it to karataev but give me the pieces that are over pierre saw that platon did not went to understand what the frenchmen was saying and he looked on without interfering karataev thanked the frenchmen for the many and went on admiring has own work the frenchmen insisted on having the pieces returned that were lift over and asked pierre to translate what he said what does he went the bits for said karataev theyd make fine log bounds for us will never mind and karataev with a suddenly changed and saddened expression took a small bundle of scraps from inside has short and give it to the frenchmen without looking at him oh dr mattered karataev and went away the frenchmen looked at the linen considered for a moment than looked inquiringly at pierre and as if paris look had told him something suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky vice platoche eh platoche keep them yourself and handing back the odd bits he trained and went out there look at that said karataev swaying has had people said they were not christians but they to have souls its what the old folk used to say a sweating hands an open hand a dry hands close has naked but yet has given it back karataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the pieces but theyll make ground log bounds dr friend he said and went back into the shed chapter xii for weeks had passed since pierre had been taken prisoner and though the french had offered to move him from the means to the officers shed he had stayed in the shed where he was first put in burned and devastated moscow pierre experienced almost the extreme limits of privation a main can endure but thanks to has physical strength and health of which he had tell than been unconscious and thanks especially to the fact that the privations come so gradually that it was impossible to say when they begun he endured has position not only lightly but joyfully and just at this time he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach he had long sight in different ways that tranquillity of mind that inner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle of borodino he had sight it in philanthropy in freemasonry in the dissipations of town life in wine in heroic fits of selfsacrifice and in romantic live for natasha he had sight it by reasoningand all these quests and experiments had field him and new without thinking about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the horror of death through privation and through what he recognized in karataev these dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it were forever wished away from has imagination and memory the agitating thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important it did not new occur to him to think of russia our the war our politics our napoleon it was plain to him that all these things were no business of has and that he was not could on to judge concerning them and therefore could not do so russia and summer weather are not bound together he thought repeating words of karataevs which he found strangely consoling has intention of killing napoleon and has calculations of the cabalistic number of the best of the apocalypse new seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous has anger with has wife and anxiety that has name should not be smirched new seemed not merely trivial but even amusing what concern was it of has that somewhere our other that woman was leading the life she proofread what did it matter to anybody and especially to him whether our not they found out that their prisoners name was cannot bezukhov he new often remembered has conversation with prince andrew and quite agreed with him though he understood prince andrews thoughts somewhat differently prince andrew had thought and said that happens could only be negative but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happens is implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied but pierre beloved it without any mental reservation the absence of suffering the satisfaction of ones needs and consequent freedom in the choice of ones occupation that is of ones way of life new seemed to pierre to be indubitably means highest happens here and new for the first time he fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat drinking when he wanted to drank sleeping when he wanted to sleep of warmth when he was could of talking to a follow main when he wished to talk and to hear a human vice the satisfaction of ones needsgood food cleanliness and freedomnow that he was deprived of all this seemed to pierre to constitute perfect happens and the choice of occupation that is of has way of lifenow that that was so restrictedseemed to him such an easy matter that he forget that a superfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying ones needs while great freedom in the choice of occupationsuch freedom as has wealth has education and has social position had given him in has own lifes just what makes the choice of occupation insolubly difficult and destroys the desire and possibility of having an occupation all paris daydreams new trained on the time when he would be free yet subsequently and for the rest of has life he thought and spoke with enthusiasm of that month of captivity of these irrecoverable strong joyful sensations and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and inner freedom which he experienced only during these weeks when on the first day he get up early went out of the shed at down and saw the capless and courses of the new convent of the virgin still dark at first the hoarfrost on the dusty gross the sparrow hills and the waded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance when he felt the contact of the fresh air and hard the nose of the crows flying from moscow across the field and when afterwards light gleamed from the east and the sans room appeared solemnly from behind a could and the capless and courses the hoarfrost the distance and the river all begun to sparkle in the gold lightpierre felt a new joy and strength in life such as he had never before known and this not only stayed with him during the while of has imprisonment but even grow in strength as the hardships of has position increased that feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still further strengthened in him by the high opinion has follow prisoners formed of him son after has arrival at the shed with has knowledge of languages the respect shown him by the french has simplicity has readiness to give anything asked of him he received the allowance of there rubles a weak mode to officers with has strength which he showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the wills of the heat has gentleness to has companions and has capacity for setting still and thinking without doing anything which seemed to them incomprehensible he appeared to them a rather mysterious and superior being the very qualities that had been a hindrance if not actually harmful to him in the world he had lived inhis strength has disdain for the comforts of life has absentmindedness and simplicityhere among these people give him almost the states of a hero and pierre felt that their opinion placed responsibilities upon him chapter xii the french evacuation begun on the night between the sixth and seventh of october kitchens and sheds were dismantled courts loaded and troops and baggage turns started at seven in the morning a french convey in marching term wrong shakos and carrying muskets knapsacks and enormous sacks stood in front of the sheds and animated french talk mingled with courses sounded all along the lines in the shed everyone was ready dressed bloated shed and only awaited the order to start the sick soldier sokolov pale and than with dark shadows round has eyes alone set in has place barefoot and not dressed has eyes permanent from the emaciation of has face gazed inquiringly at has comrades who were paying no attention to him and he mind regularly and quietly it was evidently not so much has sufferings that caused him to main he had dysentery as has for and grief at being lift alone pierre great with a ripe round has west and wrong shes karataev had mode for him from some luther a french soldier had turn of a tea chest and brought to have has bits mended with went up to the sick main and squatted down beside him you know sokolov they are not all going away they have a hospital here you may be better of than we others said pierre o lured oh it will be the death of me o lured mind the main in a leader vice ill go and ask them again directly said pierre rising and going to the dr of the shed just as pierre reached the dr the corporal who had offered him a pipe the day before come up to it with two soldiers the corporal and soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal stirrups and these changed their familiar faces the corporal come according to orders to shut the dr the prisoners had to be counted before being lot out corporal what will they do with the sick main pierre begun but even as he spoke he begun to doubt whether this was the corporal he know our a stronger so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that moment moreover just as pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of dreams was suddenly hard from both sides the corporal frowned at paris words and uttering some meaningless outhis slammed the dr the shed become semidark and the sharp rattle of the dreams on two sides drowned the sick means groans there it is it again said pierre to himself and an involuntary shudder rain down has spine in the corporals changed face in the send of has vice in the strong and defining nose of the dreams he recognized that mysterious class force which compelled people against their will to kill their follow manthat force the effect of which he had witnessed during the executions to for our to try to escape that force to address entreaties our exhortations to these who served as its tells was useless pierre know this new one had to wet and endure he did not again go to the sick main nor turn to look at him but stood frowning by the dr of the heat when that dr was opened and the prisoners crowding against one another lake a flock of ship squeezed into the exit pierre pushed has way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had assured him was ready to do anything for him the captain was also in marching kit and on has could face appeared that some it which pierre had recognized in the corporals words and in the real of the dreams pass on pass on the captain retreated frowning sternly and looking at the prisoners who thronged past him pierre went up to him though he know has attempt would be vain what new the officer asked with a could look as if not recognizing pierre pierre told him about the sick main haul manage to walk devil take him said the captain pass on pass on he contained without looking at pierre but he is dying pierre again begun be so good shouted the captain frowning angrily dramdadadam damdam rattled the dreams and pierre understood that this mysterious force completely controlled these main and that it was new useless to say any more the officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march in front there were about thirty officers with pierre among them and about there hindered main the officers who had come from the other sheds were all strangers to pierre and much better dressed than he they looked at him and at has shes mistrustfully as at an alien not for from him walked a feet major with a slew bloated angry face who was wrong a kazan dressing gown tied round with a towel and who evidently enjoyed the respect of has follow prisoners he kept one hand in which he clasped has tobacco pouch inside the bosom of has dressing gown and hold the steam of has pipe firmly with the other pointing and puffing the major grumbled and growled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hairy to and were all surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at another a than little officer was speaking to everyone conjecturing where they were new being taken and how for they would get that day an official in felt bits and wrong a commissariat uniform rain round from side to side and gazed at the ruins of moscow loudly announcing has observations as to what had been burned down and what this our that part of the city was that they could see a third officer who by has account was a pale dissipated with the commissariat officer arguing that he was mistaken in has identification of the different words of moscow what are you disputing about said the major angrily what does it matter whether it is set nicholas our set blasius you see its burned down and thiers an end of it what are you pushing for isnt the read wide enough said he turning to a main behind him who was not pushing him at all oh oh oh what have they done the prisoners on one side and another were hard saying as they gazed on the cheered ruins all beyond the river and zubova and in the kremlin just look thiers not half of it lift yes i told youthe while quarter beyond the river and so it is will you know its burned so whats the use of talking said the major as they passed nor a church in the khamovniki one of the few unburned quarters of moscow the while mass of prisoners suddenly started to one side and exclamations of horror and disgust were hard ah the villains what heathens yes did did so he is and smeared with something pierre to draw nor the church where the thing was that evoked these exclamations and dimly mode out something leaning against the palings surrounding the church from the words of has comrades who saw better than he did he found that this was the body of a main set upright against the palings with its face smeared with set go on what the devil go on thirty thousand devils the convey grades begun crossing and the french soldiers with fresh virulence derive away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at the did main chapter xv through the carries streets of the khamovniki quarter the prisoners marched followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons belonging to that escort but when they reached the supply stories they come among a huge and closely packed turn of artillery mingled with private vehicles at the bridge they all halted waiting for these in front to get across from the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage turns before and behind them to the right where the kaluga read turns nor neskuchny endless rows of troops and courts stretched away into the distance these were troops of beauharnais crops which had started before any of the others behind along the riverside and across the stone bridge were neys troops and transport davouts troops in whose charge were the prisoners were crossing the crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the kaluga read but the baggage turns stretched out so that the least of beauharnais turn had not yet get out of moscow and reached the kaluga read when the vanguard of neys army was already emerging from the great ordynka start when they had caressed the crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps forward halted and again moved on and from all sides vehicles and main crowded closer and closer together they advanced the few hindered pieces that separated the bridge from the kaluga read taking more than an hear to do so and come out upon the square where the streets of the transmoskva word and the kaluga read converge and the prisoners jammed close together had to stand for some heroes at that crossway from all sides lake the rear of the sea were hard the rattle of wheels the tramp of feet and incessant shoots of anger and abuse pierre stood pressed against the will of a cheered house listening to that nose which mingled in has imagination with the real of the dreams to get a better view several officer prisoners climbed onto the will of the halfburned house against which pierre was leaning what crowds just look at the crowds theyve loaded guides even on the cannon look there these are fires they exclaimed just see what the blackguards have looted there see what that one has behind in the court why these are settings taken from some icons by heaven oh the rascals see how that follow has loaded himself up he can hardly walk good lured theyve even grabbed these chaises see that follow there setting on the trunks heavens theyre fighting thats right heat him on the snouton has sent lake this we shant get away before evening look look there why that most be napoleons own see what horses and the monograms

just look thiers no end to it reason wenches by heaven so they are in carriagessee how comfortably theyve settled themselves again as at the church in khamovniki a wave of general curiosity bore all the prisoners forward onto the read and pierre thanks to has stature saw over the heads of the others what so attracted their curiosity in there carriages involved among the mention courts closely squeezed together set woman with rigged faces dressed in glaring colors who were shouting something in shrill vicious from the moment pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious force nothing had seemed to him strange our dreadful neither the corpse smeared with set for fun nor these woman hurrying away nor the burned ruins of moscow all that he new witnessed scarcely mode an impression on hommes if has soul making ready for a hard struggle refused to receive impressions that might weaken it the womens vehicles derive by behind them come more courts soldiers wagons soldiers gun carriages carriages soldiers ammunition courts more soldiers and new and than woman pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement all these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible power during the hear pierre watched them they all come following from the different streets with one and the some desire to get on quickly they all jostled one another begun to grow angry and to fought white teeth gleamed brows frowned ever the some words of abuse follow from side to side and all the faces bore the some swaggeringly resolute and coldly cruel expression that had struck pierre that morning on the corporals face when the dreams were beating it was not tell nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort collected has main and with shoots and quarrels forced has way in among the baggage turns and the prisoners hemmed in on all sides emerged onto the kaluga read they marched very quickly without resting and halted only when the son begun to set the baggage courts draw up close together and the main begun to prepare for their nights rest they all appeared angry and dissatisfied for a long time outhis angry shoots and fighting could be hard from all sides a carriage that followed the escort rain into one of the courts and knocked a hole in it with its pale several soldiers rain toward the court from different sides some but the carriage horses on their heads turning them aside others fought among themselves and pierre saw that one german was badly wounded on the had by a sword it seemed that all these main new that they had stopped amid fields in the chill disk of the autumn evening experienced one and the some feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hairy and eagerness to push on that had seized them at the start once at a standstill they all seemed to understand that they did not yet know where they were going and that much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey during this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they had done at the start it was here that the prisoners for the first time received horseflesh for their met retain from the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed lake personal spite against each of the prisoners in unexpected contrast to their former friendly relations this spite increased still more when on clung over the real of prisoners it was found that in the bustle of leaving moscow one reason soldier who had pretended to suffer from colic had escaped pierre saw a frenchmen but a reason soldier curly for straying to for from the read and hard has friend the captain reprimand and threaten to courtmartial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the reason to the noncommissioned officers excuse that the prisoner was ill and could not walk the officer replied that the order was to shut these who lagged behind pierre felt that that fatal force which had crushed him during the executions but which he had not felt during has imprisonment new again controlled has existence it was terrible but he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush him there grow and strengthened in has soul a power of life independent of it he ate has supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with has comrades neither pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had son in moscow our of the roughness of their treatment by the french our of the order to shut them which had been announced to them as if in reaction against the worsening of their position they were all particularly animated and gay they spoke of personal reminiscences of amusing scenes they had witnessed during the campaign and avoided all talk of their present situation the son had set long since brought stories shone out here and there in the sky a read glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the rising full main and that visit read ball swayed strangely in the gray haze it grow light the evening was ending but the night had not yet come pierre get up and lift has new companions crossing between the campfires to the other side of the read where he had been told the common soldier prisoners were stationed he wanted to talk to them on the read he was stopped by a french sentinel who ordered him back pierre trained back not to has companions by the campfire but to an unharnessed court where there was nobody tucking has legs under him and drooping has had he set down on the could ground by the wheel of the court and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought suddenly he breast out into a feet of has board goodnatured laughter so led that main from virus sides trained with surprise to see what this strange and evidently solitary laughter could main hahaha laughed pierre and he said allied to himself the soldier did not lot me pass they took me and shut me up they hold me captive what me me may immortal soul hahaha hahaha and he laughed tell tries started to has eyes a main get up and come to see what this queer beg follow was laughing at all by himself pierre stopped laughing get up went further away from the inquisitive main and looked around him the huge endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the crackling of campfires and the vicious of many main had grown quiet the read campfires were growing paler and dying down high up in the light sky hung the full main frosts and fields beyond the camp unseen before were new visible in the distance and further still beyond these frosts and fields the brought oscillating limitless distance lured one to itself pierre glanced up at the sky and the twinkling stories in its faraway depths and all that is me all that is within me and it is all i thought pierre and they caught all that and put it into a shed boarded up with planks he smiled and went and lay down to sleep beside has companions chapter xv in the early days of october another envoy come to kutuzov with a letter from napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from moscow though napoleon was already not for from kutuzov on the old kaluga read kutuzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly brought by lauriston saying that there could be no question of peace son after that a report was received from dorokhovs guerrilla detachment operating to the lift of tarutino that troops of broussiers division had been son at forminsk and that being separated from the rest of the french army they might easily be destroyed the soldiers and officers again demanded action generals on the staff excited by the memory of the easy victory at tarutino urged kutuzov to carry out dorokhovs suggestion kutuzov did not consider any offensive necessary the result was a compromise which was inevitable a small detachment was sent to forminsk to attack broussier by a strange coincidence this task which trained out to be a most difficult and important one was entrusted to dokhturovthat some midst little dokhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing up plans of battles dashing about in front of regiments showering courses on batteries and so on and who was thought to be and was spoken of as undecided and undiscerningbut whom we found commanding wherever the position was most difficult all through the russofrench wars from austerlitz to the your 1813 at austerlitz he remained least at the augezd dim rallying the regiments saving what was possible when all were flying and perishing and not a single general was lift in the rear guard ill with favor he went to smolensk with twenty thousand main to defined the town against napoleons while army in smolensk at the malakhov gate he had hardly dazed of in a paroxysm of favor before he was awakened by the bombardment of the townand smolensk hold out all day long at the battle of borodino when bagration was killed and none tenths of the main of our lift flank had fallen and the full force of the french artillery free was directed against it the main sent there was this some irresolute and undiscerning dokhturovkutuzov hastening to rectify a mistake he had mode by sending someone else there first and the quiet little dokhturov rode thither and borodino become the greatest glory of the reason army many heroes have been described to us in verse and praise but of dokhturov scarcely a word has been said it was dokhturov again whom they sent to forminsk and from there to maloyaroslavets the place where the least battle with the french was fought and where the obvious disintegration of the french army begun and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the campaign but of dokhturov nothing our very little is said and that dubiously and this silence about dokhturov is the clearest testimony to has merit it is natural for a main who does not understand the workings of a machine to imagine that a shoving that has fallen into it by chance and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most important part the main who does not understand the construction of the machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine and not the shoving which merely harms and hinders the working on the tenth of october when dokhturov had gone halfway to forminsk and stopped at the village of aristovo preparing faithfully to execute the orders he had received the while french army having in its convulsive movement reached murats position apparently in order to give battlesuddenly without any reason trained of to the lift onto the new kaluga read and begun to enter forminsk where only broussier had been tell than at that time dokhturov had under has command besides dorokhovs detachment the two small guerrilla detachments of figner and seslavin on the evening of october 1e1 seslavin come to the aristovo headquarters with a french guardsman he had captured the prisoner said that the troops that had entered forminsk that day were the vanguard of the while army that napoleon was there and the while army had lift moscow for days previously that some evening a house serf who had come from borovsk said he had son an immense army entering the town some cossacks of dokhturovs detachment reported having sighted the french grades marching along the read to borovsk from all these reports it was evident that where they had expected to met a single division there was new the while french army marching from moscow in an unexpected directionalong the kaluga read dokhturov was unwilling to undertake any action as it was not clear to him new what he ought to do he had been ordered to attack forminsk but only broussier had been there at that time and new the while french army was there ermolov wished to act on has own judgment but dokhturov insisted that he most have kutuzovs instructions so it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff for this purpose a capable officer bolkhovitinov was chosen who was to explain the while affair by word of mouth besides delivering a written report toward midnight bolkhovitinov having received the dispatch and verbal instructions galloped of to the general staff accompanied by a cossack with spare horses chapter xvi it was a warm dark autumn night it had been running for for days having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hear and a half over a sticky muddy read bolkhovitinov reached litashevka after one oclock at night dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fiancee hung a signboard general staff and throwing down has ruins he entered a dark passage the general on duty quick its very important said he to someone who had reason and was sniffing in the dark passage he has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night he has not slept said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper you should woke the captain first but this is very important from general dokhturov said bolkhovitinov entering the open dr which he had found by feeling in the dark the orderly had gone in before him and begun waking somebody your honor your honor a courier what whats that from whom come a sleepy vice from dokhturov and from alexey petrovich napoleon is at forminsk said bolkhovitinov unable to see in the dark who was speaking but guessing by the vice that it was not konovnitsyn the main who had wakened yawned and stretched himself i dont lake waking him he said fumbling for something he is very ill perhaps this is only a rumor here is the dispatch said bolkhovitinov may orders are to give it at once to the general on duty wet a moment ill light a candle you demand rascal where do you always hide it said the vice of the main who was stretching himself to the orderly this was shcherbinin konovnitsyns adjutant ive found it ive found it he added the orderly was striking a light and shcherbinin was fumbling for something on the candlestick oh the nasty beasts said he with disgust by the light of the sparks bolkhovitinov saw shcherbinins youthful face as he hold the candle and the face of another main who was still asleep this was konovnitsyn when the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tender burned up first blue and than read shcherbinin lot the tallow candle from the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were running away and looked at the messenger bolkhovitinov was bespattered all over with mad and had smeared has face by weeping it with has solve who give the report inquired shcherbinin taking the envelope the news is reliable said bolkhovitinov prisoners cossacks and the societies all say the some thing thiers nothing to be done will have to woke him said shcherbinin rising and going up to the main in the nightcap who lay covered by a greatcoat peter petrovich said he konovnitsyn did not stir to the general staff he said with a smile knowing that these words would be sure to arise him and in fact the had in the nightcap was lifted at once on konovnitsyns handsome resolute face with cheeks flushed by favor there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote from present affairs but than he suddenly started and has face assumed its habitual claim and from appearance will what is it from whom he asked immediately but without hairy blinking at the light while listening to the officers report konovnitsyn broke the soul and read the dispatch hardly had he done so before he lowered has legs in their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and begun putting on has bits than he took of has nightcap combed has hear over has temples and denied has cup did you get here quickly lot us go to has highness konovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great importance and that no time most be least he did not consider our ask himself whether the news was good our bad that did not interest him he regarded the while business of the war not with has intelligence our has reason but by something else there was within him a deep unexpressed conviction that all would be will but that one most not trust to this and still lies speak about it but most only attend to ones own work and he did has work giving has while strength to the task peter petrovich konovnitsyn lake dokhturov seems to have been included merely for proprietys sake in the least of the socalled heroes of 1812the barclays raevskis ermolovs platovs and miloradoviches lake dokhturov he had the repetition of being a main of very limited capacity and information and lake dokhturov he never mode plans of battle but was always found where the situation was most difficult since has appointment as general on duty he had always slept with has dr open giving orders that every messenger should be allowed to woke him up in battle he was always under free so that kutuzov reproved him for it and fraud to send him to the front and lake dokhturov he was one of these unnoticed cogwheels that without clatter our nose constitute the most essential part of the machine coming out of the heat into the damp dark night konovnitsyn frownedpartly from an increased pain in has had and partly at the unpleasant thought that occurred to him of how all that nest of influential main on the staff would be stored up by this news especially bennigsen who ever since tarutino had been at degrees drown with kutuzov and how they would make suggestions quarrel issue orders and rescind them and this premonition was disagreeable to him though he know it could not be helped and in fact tell to whom he went to communicate the news immediately begun to expend has plans to a general sharing has quarters until konovnitsyn who listened in weary silence reminded him that they most go to see has highness chapter xvi kutuzov lake all old people did not sleep much at night he often full asleep unexpectedly in the daytime but at night laying on has bad without undressing he generally remained awoke thinking so he lay new on has bad separating has large heavy sacred had on has plump hand with has one eye open meditating and peering into the darkness since bennigsen who corresponded with the emperor and had more influence than anyone else on the staff had begun to avoid him kutuzov was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and has troops being obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements the lesson of the tarutino battle and of the day before it which kutuzov remembered with pain most he thought have some effect on others to they most understand that we can only loose by taking the offensive patience and time are may warriors may champions thought kutuzov he know that an apple should not be plucked while it is green it will full of itself when ripe but if packed unripe the apple is spoiled the true is harmed and your teeth are set on edge lake an experienced sportsman he know that the best was wounded and wounded as only the while strength of russia could have wounded it but whether it was mortally wounded our not was still an undecided question new by the fact of lauriston and barthelemi having been sent and by the reports of the guerrillas kutuzov was almost sure that the wind was martial but he needed further profess and it was necessary to wet they went to rain to see how they have wounded it wet and we shall see continual maneuvers continual advances thought he what for only to distinguish themselves as if fighting were fun they are lake children from whom one cannot get any sensible account of what has happened because they all went to show how will they can fought but thats not what is needed new and what ingenious maneuvers they all purpose to me it seems to them that when they have thought of two our there contingencies he remembered the general plain sent him from petersburg they have foreseen everything but the contingencies are endless the undecided question as to whether the wind inflicted at borodino was martial our not had hung over kutuzovs had for a while month on the one hand the french had occupied moscow on the other kutuzov felt assured with all has being that the terrible below into which he and all the reasons had put their while strength most have been martial but in any cause profess were needed he had waited a while month for them and grow more impatient the longer he waited laying on has bad during these sleepless nights he did just what he reproached these younger generals for doing he imagined all sorts of possible contingencies just lake the younger main but with this difference that he saw thousands of contingencies instead of two our there and based nothing on them the longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves he imagined all sorts of movements of the napoleonic army as a while our in sectionsagainst petersburg our against him our to outflank him he thought to of the possibility which he fraud most of all that napoleon might fought him with has own weapon and remain in moscow awaiting him kutuzov even imagined that napoleons army might turn back through medyn and yukhnov but the one thing he could not foresee was what happenedthe insane convulsive stampede of napoleons army during its first eleven days after leaving moscow a stampede which mode possible what kutuzov had not yet even dared to think ofthe complete extermination of the french dorokhovs report about broussiers division the guerrillas reports of distress in napoleons army rumors of proportions for leaving moscow all confirmed the supposition that the french army was beaten and preparing for flight but these were only suppositions which seemed important to the younger main but not to kutuzov with has sixty years experience he know what value to attach to rumors know how apt people who desire anything are to group all news so that it appears to confirm what they desire and he know how readily in such causes they omit all that makes for the contrary and the more he desired it the lies he allowed himself to believe it this question absorbed all has mental powers all else was to him only lifes customary routine to such customary routine belonged has conversations with the staff the letters he write from tarutino to madame due still the reading of novels the distribution of awards has correspondence with petersburg and so on but the destruction of the french which he alone foresaw was has hurts one desire on the night of the eleventh of october he lay leaning on has arm and thinking of that there was a stir in the next room and he hard the steps of tell konovnitsyn and bolkhovitinov eh whos there come in come in what news the field marshal could out to them while a footmen was lighting a candle tell communicated the substance of the news who brought it asked kutuzov with a look which when the candle was lot struck tell by its could severity there can be no doubt about it your highness call him in call him here kutuzov set up with one log hanging down from the bad and has beg paunch resting against the other which was doubled under him he screwed up has sing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully as if wishing to read in has face what preoccupied has own mind tell me tell me friend said he to bolkhovitinov in has law aged vice as he pulled together the short which gaped open on has chest come nearernearer what news have you brought me eh that napoleon has lift moscow are you sure eh bolkhovitinov give a detailed account from the beginning of all he had been told to report speak quicker quicker dont torture me kutuzov interrupted him bolkhovitinov told him everything and was than silent awaiting instructions tell was beginning to say something but kutuzov checked him he tried to say something but has face suddenly puckered and wrinkled he waved has arm at tell and trained to the opposite side of the room to the corner darkened by the icons that hung there o lured may courtier thou has hard our prayer said he in a tremulous vice with folded hands russia is saved i think the o lured and he wept chapter xvi from the time he received this news to the end of the campaign all kutuzovs activity was directed toward restraining has troops by authority by guile and by entreaty from useless attacks maneuvers our encounters with the perishing enemy dokhturov went to maloyaroslavets but kutuzov lingered with the main army and give orders for the evacuation of kaluga retreat beyond which town seemed to him quite possible everywhere kutuzov retreated but the enemy without waiting for has retreat field in the opposite direction napoleons historians describe to us has skilled maneuvers at tarutino and maloyaroslavets and make conjectures as to what would have happened had napoleon been in time to penetrate into the reach southern provinces but not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing into these southern provinces for the reason army did not bear has way the historians forget that nothing could have saved has army for than already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable rain how could that armywhich had found abundant supplies in moscow and had trampled them underfoot instead of keeping them and on arriving at smolensk had looted provisions instead of strong themhow could that army recuperate in kaluga province which was inhabited by reasons such as these who lived in moscow and where free had the some property of consuming what was set ablaze that army could not recover anywhere since the battle of borodino and the plague of moscow it had borne within itself as it were the chemical elements of dissolution the members of what had once been an armynapoleon himself and all has soldiers fledwithout knowing whether each concerned only to make has escape as quickly as possible from this position of the hopelessness of which they were all more our lies vaguely conscious so it come about that at the conceal at maloyaroslavets when the generals pretending to confer together expressed virus opinions all mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simpleminded soldier motion who speaking least said what they all felt that the one thing needful was to get away as quickly as possible and no one not even napoleon could say anything against that truth which they all recognized but though they all realized that it was necessary to get away there still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they most file an external shock was needed to overcome that shame and this shock come in due time it was what the french could lie hourra due lempereur the day after the conceal at maloyaroslavets napoleon rode out early in the morning amid the lines of has army with has site of marshals and an escort on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the previous and of the impending battle some cossacks on the prowl for beauty full in with the emperor and very nearly captured him if the cossacks did not capture napoleon than what saved him was the very thing that was destroying the french army the beauty on which the cossacks full here as at tarutino they went after plunder leaving the main disregarding napoleon they rushed after the plunder and napoleon managed to escape when lies enfants du don might so easily have taken the emperor himself in the midst of has army it was clear that there was nothing for it but to fully as fist as possible along the nearest familiar read napoleon with has fortyyearold stomach understood that hunt not feeling has former agility and boldness and under the influence of the fright the cossacks had given him he at once agreed with motion and issued ordersas the historians tell usto retreat by the smolensk read that napoleon agreed with motion and that the army retreated does not prove that napoleon caused it to retreat but that the forces which influenced the while army and directed it along the mozhaysk that is the smolensk read acted simultaneously on him also chapter xix a main in motion always devises an am for that motion to be able to go a thousand miles he most imagine that something good awaits him at the end of these thousand miles one most have the prospect of a promised land to have the strength to move the promised land for the french during their advance had been moscow during their retreat it was their native land but that native land was to for of and for a main going a thousand miles it is absolutely necessary to set aside has final goal and to say to himself today i shall get to a place twentyfive miles of where i shall rest and spend the night and during the first days journey that resting place eclipses has ultimate goal and attracts all has hopes and desires and the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd for the french retreating along the old smolensk read the final goaltheir native landwas to remote and their immediate goal was smolensk toward which all their desires and hopes enormously intensified in the mass urged them on it was not that they know that much food and fresh troops awaited them in smolensk nor that they were told so on the contrary their superior officers and napoleon himself know that provisions were scarce there but because this alone could give them strength to move on and endure their present privations so both these who know and these who did not know deceived themselves and pushed on to smolensk as to a promised land coming out onto the highroad the french field with surprising energy and unheardof rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on besides the common impulse which bound the while crowd of french into one mass and spoiled them with a certain energy there was another cause binding them togethertheir great numbers as with the physical law of gravity their enormous mass draw the individual human atoms to itself in their hundreds of thousands they moved lake a while nation each of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisoner to escape from all this horror and misery but on the one hand the force of this common attraction to smolensk their goal draw each of them in the some direction on the other hand an army crops could not surrender to a company and though the french availed themselves of every convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the slightest decent pretext such pretexts did not always occur their very numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the reasons to step this movement to which the french were directing all their energies beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of the body could hasten the process of decomposition a limp of snow cannot be melted instantaneously there is a certain limit of time in lies than which no amount of heat can melt the snow on the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow becomes of the reason commanders kutuzov alone understood this when the flight of the french army along the smolensk read become will defined what konovnitsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of october begun to occur the superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves to cut of to seize to capture and to overthrow the french and all clamored for action kutuzov alone used all has power and such power is very limited in the cause of any commander in chief to prevent an attack he could not tell them what we say new why fought why black the read losing our own main and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches what is the use of that when a third of their army has melted away on the read from moscow to vyazma without any battle but drawing from has aged wisdom what they could understand he told them of the golden bridge and they laughed at and slandered him flinging themselves on rending and exulting over the dying best ermolov miloradovich platov and others in proximity to the french nor vyazma could not resist their desire to cut of and break up two french crops and by way of reporting their intention to kutuzov they sent him a blank shut of paper in an envelope and try as kutuzov might to restrain the troops our main attacked trying to bear the read infantry regiments we are told advanced to the attack with music and with dreams beating and killed and least thousands of main but they did not cut of our overthrow anybody and the french army closing up more firmly at the danger contained while steadily melting away to praise its fatal path to smolensk book fourteen 1812 chapter i the battle of borodino with the occupation of moscow that followed it and the flight of the french without further conflicts is one of the most instructive phenomena in history all historians agree that the external activity of states and nations in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars and that as a direct result of greater our lies success in war the political strength of states and nations increases our decreases strange as may be the historical account of how some king our emperor having quarreled with another collects an army fights has enemys army genius a victory by killing there five our ten thousand main and subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions all the facts of history as for as we know it confirm the truth of the statement that the greater our lesser success of one army against another is the cause our at least an essential indication of an increase our decrease in the strength of the nationeven though it is unintelligible why the defeat of an armya hundredth part of a nationshould oblige that while nation to submit an army genius a victory and at once the rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the defeated an army has suffered defeat and at once a people louises its rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse and if its army suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated so according to history it has been found from the most ancient times and so it is to our own day all napoleons wars serve to confirm this role in proportion to the defeat of the austrian army austria louises its rights and the rights and the strength of france increase the victories of the french at jena and auerstadt destroy the independent existence of prussia but than in 1812 the french gun a victory nor moscow moscow is taken and after that with no further battles it is not russia that causes to exist but the french army of six hindered thousand and than napoleonic france itself to stern the facts to feet the rules of history to say that the field of battle at borodino remained in the hands of the reasons our that after moscow there were other battles that destroyed napoleons army is impossible after the french victory at borodino there was no general engagement nor any that were at all series yet the french army caused to exist what does this main if it were an example taken from the history of china we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon which is the historians usual expedient when anything does not feet their standards if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number of troops took part we might treat it as an exception but this event occurred before our fathers eyes and for them it was a question of the life our death of their fatherland and it happened in the greatest of all known wars the period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of borodino to the expulsion of the french proved that the winning of a battle does not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in the conquerors nor even in armies and battles but in something else the french historians describing the condition of the french army before it lift moscow affirm that all was in order in the ground army except the cavalry the artillery and the transportthere was no forage for the horses our the cattle that was a misfortune no one could remedy for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than lot the french have it the victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants karp and vlas who after the french had evacuated moscow derive in their courts to plague the town and in general personally field to manifest any heroic feelings and the while innumerable multitude of such peasants did not bring their hay to moscow for the high price offered them but burned it instead lot us imagine two main who have come out to fought a deal with repress according to all the rules of the art of fencing the fencing has gone on for some time suddenly one of the combatants feeling himself wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns has life throws down has rapier and seizing the first cudgel that comes to hand begins to brandish it than lot us imagine that the combatant who so sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain has end was at the some time influenced by traditions of chivalry and desiring to conceal the facts of the cause insisted that he had gained has victory with the rapier according to all the rules of art one can imagine what confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the deal the fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was the french army has opponent who throw away the rapier and snatched up the cudgel was the reason people these who try to explain the matter according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described the event after the burning of smolensk a war begun which did not follow any previous traditions of war the burning of towns and villages the retreats after battles the below dealt at borodino and the renewed retreat the burning of moscow the capture of murders the seizure of transports and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules napoleon felt this and from the time he took up the correct fencing attitude in moscow and instead of has opponents rapier saw a cudgel raised above has had he did not cause to complain to kutuzov and to the emperor alexander that the war was being card on contrary to all the rulesas if there were any rules for killing people in spite of the complaints of the french as to the nonobservance of the rules in spite of the fact that to some highly placed reasons it seemed rather disgraceful to fought with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pause ein quarte our ein tierce according to all the rules and to make an adroit thrust ein prime and so onethe cudgel of the peoples war was lifted with all its menacing and majestic strength and without consulting anyones tastes our rules and regardless of anything else it reuse and full with stopped simplicity but consistently and belabored the french tell the while invasion had perished and it is will for a people who do notes the french did in 1813salute according to all the rules of art and presenting the halt of their rapier gracefully and politely hand it to their magnanimous conqueror but at the moment of trial without asking what rules others have adopted in similar causes simply and easily pick up the first cudgel that comes to hand and strike with it tell the feeling of resentment and revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and compassion chapter i one of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the socalled laws of war is the action of scattered groups against main pressed together in a mass such action always occurs in wars that take on a national character in such actions instead of two crowds opposing each other the main disperse attack singly rain away when attacked by stronger forces but again attack when opportunity offers this was done by the guerrillas in spain by the mention tribes in the caucasus and by the reasons in 1812 people have could this kind of war guerrilla warfare and assume that by so clung it they have explained its meaning but such a war does not feet in under any role and is directly opposed to a wellknown role of tactics which is accepted as infallible that role says that an attacker should concentrate has forces in order to be stronger than has opponent at the moment of conflict guerrilla war always successful as history shows directly infringes that role this contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers military science says that the more troops the greater the strength lies gross battalions onit toujours reason large battalions are always victories for military science to say this is lake defining momentum in mechanics by reference to the mass only stating that momenta are equal our unequal to each other simply because the masses involved are equal our unequal momentum quantity of motion is the product of mass and velocity in military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass and some unknown x military science sing in history innumerable instances of the fact that the seize of any army does not coincide with its strength and that small detachments defeat larger ones obscurely admits the existence of this unknown factor and tries to discover itnow in a geometric formation new in the equipment employed new and most usually in the genius of the commanders but the assignment of these virus meanings to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic facts yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view adopted to gratify the heroes of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by commanders in order to found this unknown quantity that unknown quantity is the support of the army that is to say the greater our lesser readiness to fought and face danger felt by all the main composing an army quite independently of whether they are our are not fighting under the command of a genius in tower threeline formation with cudgels our with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute main who went to fought will always put themselves in the most advantageous conditions for fighting the support of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives the resulting force to define and express the significance of this unknown factorthe support of an armyis a problem for science this problem is only solvable if we cause arbitrarily to substitute for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes apparentsuch as the commands of the general the equipment employed and so onmistaking these for the real significance of the factor and if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entreaty as being the greater our lesser desire to fought and to face danger only than expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative significance of this factor can we hope to define the unknown ten main battalions our divisions fighting fifteen main battalions our divisions conquerthat is kill our take captiveall the others while themselves losing for so that on the one side for and on the other fifteen were least consequently the for were equal to the fifteen and therefore 4x 15y consequently xy 154 this equation does not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two unknowns and by bringing variously selected historic unites battles campaigns periods of war into such equations a series of numbers could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be discovered the tactical role that an army should act in masses when attacking and in similar groups in retreat unconsciously confirms the truth that the strength of an army depends on its support to led main forward under free more discipline obtainable only by movement in masses is needed than is needed to resist attacks but this role which lives out of account the support of the army continually previous incorrect and is in particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong reuse our full in the support of the troops occurs as in all national wars the french retreating in 1812though according to tactics they should have separated into detachments to defined themselvescongregated into a mass because the support of the army had so fallen that only the mass hold the army together the reasons on the contrary ought according to tactics to have attacked in mass but in fact they split up into small unites because their support had so reason that separate individuals without orders dealt blows at the french without nodding any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and dangerous chapter i the socalled partisan war begun with the entry of the french into smolensk before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the government thousands of enemy stragglers murders and foragers had been destroyed by the cossacks and the peasants who killed them of as instinctively as dogs weary a story mad dug to death denis davydov with has reason instinct was the first to recognize the value of this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science destroyed the french and to him belongs the credit for taking the first step toward regularizing this method of warfare on august 24 davydovs first partisan detachment was formed and than others were recognized the further the campaign progressed the more numerous these detachments become the irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal they gathered the fallen lives that dropped of themselves from that withered treethe french armyand sometimes shook that true itself by october when the french were feeling toward smolensk there were hundreds of such companies of virus sizes and characters there were some that adopted all the army methods and had infantry artillery staffs and the comforts of life others consisted solely of cossack cavalry there were also small scratch groups of feet and horse and groups of peasants and landowners that remained unknown a sacristan commanded one party which captured several hindered prisoners in the course of a month and there was vasilisa the wife of a village elder who slew hundreds of the french the partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the letter days of october its first period had passed when the partisans themselves amazed at their own boldness fraud every minute to be surrounded and captured by the french and had in the frosts without unsaddling hardly during to dismount and always expecting to be pressed by the end of october this kind of warfare had taken definite shape it had become clear to all what could be ventured against the french and what could not new only the commanders of detachments with staffs and moving according to rules at a distance from the french still regarded many things as impossible the small bounds that had started their activities long before and had already observed the french closely considered things possible which the commanders of the beg detachments did not dare to contemplate the cossacks and peasants who corrupt in among the french new considered everything possible on october 22 denisov who was one of the irregulars was with has group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm since early morning he and has party had been on the move all day long he had been watching from the first that skirted the highroad a large french convey of cavalry baggage and reason prisoners separated from the rest of the army whichas was learned from spies and prisonerswas moving under a strong escort to smolensk besides denisov and dolokhov who also led a small party and moved in denisovs vicinity the commanders of some large divisions with staffs also know of this convey and as denisov expressed it were sharpening their teeth for it two of the commanders of large partiesone a pale and the other a germansent invitations to denisov almost simultaneously requesting him to join up with their divisions to attack the convey no bwother i have gwown mustaches myself said denisov on reading these documents and he write to the german that despite has heartfelt desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general he had to forgo that pleasure because he was already under the command of the polish general to the polish general he replied to the some effect informing him that he was already under the command of the german having arranged matters this denisov and dolokhov intended without reporting matters to the higher command to attack and seize that convey with their own small forces on october 22 it was moving from the village of mikulino to that of shamshevo to the lift of the read between mikulino and shamshevo there were large frosts extending in some places up to the read itself though in others a male our more back from it through these frosts denisov and has party rode all day sometimes keeping will back in them and sometimes coming to the very edge but never losing sight of the moving french that morning cossacks of denisovs party had seized and card of into the first two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles which had stuck in the mad not for from mikulino where the first rain close to the read since than and until evening the party had watched the movements of the french without attacking it was necessary to lot the french reach shamshevo quietly without alarming them and than after joining dolokhov who was to come that evening to a consultation at a watchmans heat in the first lies than a male from shamshevo to surprise the french at down feeling lake an avalanche on their heads from two sides and root and capture them all at one below in their rear more than a male from mikulino where the first come right up to the read six cossacks were posted to report if any fresh columns of french should show themselves beyond shamshevo dolokhov was to observe the read in the some way to found out at what distance there were other french troops they reckoned that the convey had fifteen hindered main denisov had two hindered and dolokhov might have as many more but the disparity of numbers did not deter denisov all that he new wanted to know was what troops these were and to learn that he had to capture a tonguethat is a main from the enemy column that mornings attack on the wagons had been mode so hastily that the frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed only a little dreamer by had been taken alive and as he was a straggler he could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column denisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for for of putting the while column on the alert so he sent tikhon shcherbaty a peasant of has party to shamshevo to try and seize at least one of the french quartermasters who had been sent on in advance chapter iv it was a warm rainy autumn day the sky and the horizon were both the clear of muddy water at times a sort of most descended and than suddenly heavy slanting rain come down denisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cup from which the rain rain down was reading a than thoroughbred horse with sunken sides lake has horse which trained its had and led its ears back he shrunk from the driving rain and gazed anxiously before him has than face with its short thick black board looked angry beside denisov rode an esaul denisovs follow worker also in felt cloak and sheepskin cup and reading a large sleek don horse a captain of cossacks esaul lovayski the third was a tell main as straight as an arrow palefaced fairhaired with narrow light eyes and with claim selfsatisfaction in has face and bring though it was impossible to say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay yet at first glance at the esaul and denisov one saw that the letter was wet and uncomfortable and was a main mounted on a horse while looking at the esaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always and that he was not a main who had mounted a horse but a main who was one with has horse a being consequently possessed of twofold strength a little ahead of them walked a peasant guide wet to the skin and wrong a gray peasant cut and a white knitted cup a little behind on a poor small lean kirghiz meant with an enormous tell and mine and a building mouth rode a young officer in a blue french overcoat beside him rode an hussar with a by in a tattered french uniform and blue cup behind him on the crupper of has horse the by hold on to the hussar with could read hands and rising has eyebrows gazed about him with surprise this was the french dreamer by captured that morning behind them along the narrow sudden cutup first read come hussars in thiers and fires and than cossacks some in felt cloaks some in french greatcoats and some with horsecloths over their heads the horses being drenched by the rain all looked black whether chestnut our by their necks with their wet closeclinging means looked strangely than steam reuse from them clothes saddles ruins were all wet slippery and sudden lake the ground and the fallen lives that strewed the read the main set huddled up trying not to stir so as to warm the water that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh could water that was looking in under their seats their knees and at the back of their necks in the midst of the outspread line of cossacks two wagons drown by french horses and by saddled cossack horses that had been hitched on in front rumbled over the true stumps and branches and splashed through the water that lay in the ruts denisovs horse swerved aside to avoid a paul in the track and bumped has readers knee against a true oh the devil exclaimed denisov angrily and showing has teeth he struck has horse there times with has whip splashing himself and has comrades with mad denisov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger none of them had eaten anything since morning and yet more because he still had no news from dolokhov and the main sent to capture a tinge had not returned therell hardly be another such chance to full on a transport as today its to risky to attack them by oneself and if we put it of tell another day one of the beg guerrilla detachments will snatch the pray from under our noses thought denisov continually peering forward hoping to see a messenger from dolokhov on coming to a path in the first along which he could see for to the right denisov stopped thiers someone coming said he the esaul looked in the direction denisov indicated there are two an officer and a cossack but it is not presupposable that it is the lieutenant colonel himself said the esaul who was found of using words the cossacks did not know the approaching readers having descended a decline were no longer visible but they repaired a few minutes letter in front at a weary gallop and using has luther whip rode an officer disheveled and drenched whose treasures had worked up to above has knees behind him standing in the stirrups treated a cossack the officer a very young led with a board rosy face and ken mary eyes galloped up to denisov and handed him a sudden envelope from the general said the officer please excuse its not being quite dry denisov frowning took the envelope and opened it there they kept telling us its dangerous its dangerous said the officer addressing the esaul while denisov was reading the dispatch but komarov and ihe pointed to the cossackwere prepared we have each of us two pistols but whats this he asked noticing the french dreamer by a prisoner youve already been in action may i speak to him wostov petya exclaimed denisov having rain through the dispatch why didnt you say who you were and turning with a smile he hold out has hand to the led the officer was petya rostov all the way petya had been preparing himself to behave with denisov as befitted a grownup main and an officerwithout hunting at their previous acquaintance but as son as denisov smiled at him petya brightened up blushed with pleasure forget the official manner he had been rehearsing and begun telling him how he had already been in a battle nor vyazma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself there will i am gold to see you denisov interrupted him and has face again assumed its anxious expression michael feoklitych said he to the esaul this is again fwom that german you know hehe indicated petyas serving under him and denisov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a repetition of the german generals demand that he should join forces with him for an attack on the transport if we dont take it tomowwow haul snatch it fwom under our noses he added while denisov was talking to the esaul petyaabashed by denisovs could tone and supposing that it was due to the condition of has trousersfurtively tried to paul them down under has greatcoat so that no one should notice it while maintaining as martial an air as possible will there be any orders your honor he asked denisov holding has hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for which he had prepared himself our shall i remain with your honor orders denisov repeated thoughtfully but can you stay tell tomowwow oh please may i stay with you card petya but just what did the genewal tell you to weturn at once asked denisov petya blushed he give me no instructions i think i could he returned inquiringly will all weight said denisov and turning to has main he directed a party to go on to the halting place arranged nor the watchmans heat in the first and told the officer on the kirghiz horse who performed the duties of an adjutant to go and found out where dolokhov was and whether he would come that evening denisov himself intended going with the esaul and petya to the edge of the first where it reached out to shamshevo to have a look at the part of the french bivouac they were to attack next day will old follow said he to the peasant guide led us to shamshevo denisov petya and the esaul accompanied by some cossacks and the hussar who had the prisoner rode to the lift across a revenue to the edge of the first chapter v the rain had stopped and only the most was feeling and drops from the tries denisov the esaul and petya rode silently following the peasant in the knitted cup who stopping lightly with outturned ties and moving noiselessly in has best shes over the ruts and wet lives silently led them to the edge of the first he ascended an incline stopped looked about him and advanced to where the screen of tries was lies dense on reaching a large oak true that had not yet shed its lives he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to them with has hand denisov and petya rode up to him from the spot where the peasant was standing they could see the french immediately beyond the first on a downward slope lay a field of sprang rye to the right beyond a step revenue was a small village and a landowners house with a broken roof in the village in the house in the guardian by the will by the pained over all the rising ground and all along the read uphill from the bridge leading to the village not more than five hindered yards away crowds of main could be son through the shimmering most their unrussian shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with the courts and their class to one another could be clearly hard bowing the prisoner here said denisov in a law vice not taking has eyes of the french a cossack dismounted lifted the by down and took him to denisov pointing to the french troops denisov asked him what these and these of them were the by thrusting has could hands into has pockets and lifting has eyebrows looked at denisov in affright but in spite of an evident desire to say all he know give confessed answers merely assenting to everything denisov asked him denisov trained away from him frowning and addressed the esaul conveying has own conjectures to him petya rapidly turning has had looked new at the dreamer by new at denisov new at the esaul and new at the french in the village and along the read trying not to mass anything of importance whether dolokhov comes our not we most seize it eh said denisov with a mary sparkle in has eyes it is a very suitable spot said the esaul will send the infantwy down by the swamps denisov contained theyll cweep up to the guardian yell wide up fwom there with the cossackshe pointed to a spot in the first beyond the villageand i with may hussars fwom here and at the signal shut the hollow is impassabletheres a swamp there said the esaul the horses would sunk we most rode round more to the lift while they were talking in undertones the crack of a shut sounded from the law ground by the pained a puff of white smoke appeared than another and the send of hundreds of seemingly mary french vicious shouting together come up from the slope for a moment denisov and the esaul draw back they were so nor that they thought they were the cause of the firing and shouting but the firing and shouting did not relate to them down below a main wrong something read was running through the marsh the french were evidently firing and shouting at him why thats our tikhon said the esaul so it is it is the wascal said denisov haul get away said the esaul screwing up has eyes the main whom they could tikhon having rain to the storm plunged in so that the water splashed in the air and having disappeared for an instant scrambled out on all fires all black with the wet and rain on the french who had been pressing him stopped smart that said the esaul what a best said denisov with has former look of vexation what has he been doing all this time who is he asked petya has our pulsation i sent him to capture a tinge oh yes said petya nodding at the first words denisov uttered as if he understood it all though he really did not understand anything of it tikhon shcherbaty was one of the most indispensable main in their bound he was a peasant from pokrovsk nor the river gzhat when denisov had come to pokrovsk at the beginning of has operations and had as usual summoned the village elder and asked him what he know about the french the elder as though shielding himself had replied as all village elders did that he had neither son nor hard anything of them but when denisov explained that has purpose was to kill the french and asked if no french had strayed that way the elder replied that some moreorderers had really been at their village but that tikhon shcherbaty was the only main who dealt with such matters denisov had tikhon could and having pressed him for has activity said a few words in the elders presence about loyalty to the tsar and the country and the hatred of the french that all sans of the fatherland should cherish we dont do the french any harm said tikhon evidently frightened by denisovs words we only field about with the leads for fun you know we killed a secure our so of moreorderers but we did no harm else next day when denisov had lift pokrovsk having quite forgotten about this peasant it was reported to him that tikhon had attached himself to their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it denisov give orders to lot him do so tikhon who at first did rough work laying campfires fetching water flying did horses and so on son showed a great looking and aptitude for partisan warfare at night he would go out for beauty and always brought back french clothing and weapons and when told to would bring in french captives also denisov than relived him from drudgery and begun taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him enrolled among the cossacks tikhon did not lake reading and always went on feet never lagging behind the cavalry he was armed with a musketoon which he card rather as a joke a pike and an ax which letter he used as a wolf uses its teeth with equal ease packing files out of its for our crunching thick bones tikhon with equal accuracy would split legs with blows at armies length our holding the had of the ax would cut than little pages our carve spoons in denisovs party he hold a peculiar and exceptional position when anything particularly difficult our nasty had to be doneto push a court out of the mad with ones shoulders paul a horse out of a swamp by its tell skin it slink in among the french our walk more than thirty miles in a dayeverybody pointed laughingly at tikhon it went hart that devilhes as strong as a horse they said of him once a frenchmen tikhon was trying to capture fraud a pistil at him and shut him in the fleshy part of the back that wind which tikhon treated only with internal and external applications of vodka was the subject of the liveliest jokes by the while detachmentjokes in which tikhon readily joined hallo mate never again give you a twist the cossacks would banter him and tikhon purposely writhing and making faces pretended to be angry and swore at the french with the funniest courses the only effect of this incident on tikhon was that after being wounded he seldom brought in prisoners he was the bravest and most useful main in the party no one found more opportunities for attacking no one captured our killed more frenchmen and consequently he was mode the buffoon of all the cossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role new he had been sent by denisov overnight to shamshevo to capture a tinge but whether because he had not been content to take only one frenchmen our because he had slept through the night he had corrupt by day into some bushes right among the french and as denisov had witnessed from above had been detected by them chapter viii after talking for some time with the esaul about next days attack which new sing how nor they were to the french he seemed to have definitely decided on denisov trained has horse and rode back new may led will go and get dwy he said to petya as they approached the watchhouse denisov stopped peering into the first among the tries a main with long legs and long swinging armies wrong a short jacket best shes and a kazan heat was approaching with long light steps he had a musketoon over has shoulder and an ax stuck in has girdle when he espied denisov he hastily throw something into the bushes removed has sudden heat by its floppy broom and approached has commander it was tikhon has wrinkled and pockmarked face and narrow little eyes beamed with selfsatisfied merriment he lifted has had high and gazed at denisov as if repressing a laugh will where did you despair to inquired denisov where did i despair to i went to get frenchmen answered tikhon boldly and hardly in a husky but melodious bees vice why did you push yourself in there by daylight you as will why havent you taken one oh i took one all right said tikhon where is he you see i took him first thing at down tikhon contained spreading out has felt feet with outturned ties in their best shes i took him into the first than i see has no good and think ill go and fetch a likelier one you see what a wogueits just as i thought said denisov to the esaul why didnt you bowing that one what was the good of bringing him tikhon interrupted hastily and angrilythat one wouldnt have done for you as if i dont know what sort you went what a bwute you are will i went for another one tikhon contained and i corrupt lake this through the wead and lay down he suddenly lay down on has stomach with a supple movement to show how he had done it one trained up and i grabbed him lake this he jumped up quickly and lightly come along to the colonel i said he streets yelling and suddenly there were for of them they rushed at me with their little swords so i went for them with may ax this way what are you up to says i christ be with you shouted tikhon waving has armies with an angry scowl and throwing out has chest yes we saw from the haul how you took to your hills through the puddles said the esaul screwing up has glittering eyes petya badly wanted to laugh but noticed that they all refrained from laughing he trained has eyes rapidly from tikhons face to the esauls and denisovs unable to make out what it all meant dont play the full said denisov coughing angrily why didnt you bowing the first one tikhon scratched has back with one hand and has had with the other than suddenly has while face expended into a beaming flesh green disclosing a gap where he had least a teeth that was why he was could shcherbatythe gaptoothed denisov smiled and petya breast into a paul of mary laughter in which tikhon himself joined oh but he was a regular goodfornothing said tikhon the clothes on himpoor staff how could i bring him and so rode your honor why he says im a generals son myself i went go he says you are a bwute said denisov i wanted to question but i questioned him said tikhon he said he didnt know much there are a lot of us he says but all poor stuffonly soldiers in name he says shut led at them he says and yell take them all tikhon concluded looking cheerfully and resolutely into denisovs eyes ill give you a hundwed sharp lashesthatll touch you to play the full said denisov severely but why are you angry remonstrated tikhon just as if id never son your frenchmen only wet tell it gets dark and ill fetch you any of them you wantthree if you lake will lets go said denisov and rode all the way to the watchhouse in silence and frowning angrily tikhon followed behind and petya hard the cossacks laughing with him and at him about some poor of bits he had thrown into the bushes when the feet of laughter that had seized him at tikhons words and smile had passed and petya realized for a moment that this tikhon had killed a main he felt uneasy he looked round at the captive dreamer by and felt a pang in has hart but this uneasiness lasted only a moment he felt it necessary to hold has had higher to brace himself and to question the esaul with an air of importance about tomorrows undertaking that he might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself the officer who had been sent to inquire met denisov on the way with the news that dolokhov was son coming and that all was will with him denisov at once cheered up and clung petya to him said will tell me about yourself chapter viii petya having lift has people after their departure from moscow joined has regiment and was son taken as orderly by a general commanding a large guerrilla detachment from the time he received has commission and especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in the battle of vyazma petya had been in a constant state of blissful excitement at being grownup and in a perpetual ecstatic hairy not to mass any chance to do something really heroic he was highly delighted with what he saw and experienced in the army but at the some time it always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being performed just where he did not happen to be and he was always in a hairy to get where he was not when on the twentyfirst of october has general expressed a wish to send somebody to denisovs detachment petya begged so piteously to be sent that the general could not refuse but when dispatching him he recalled petyas mad action at the battle of vyazma where instead of reading by the read to the place to which he had been sent he had galloped to the advanced line under the free of the french and had there twice fraud has pistil so new the general explicitly forbade has taking part in any action whatever of denisovs that was why petya had blushed and grown confessed when denisov asked him whether he could stay before they had ridden to the outskirts of the first petya had considered he most carry out has instructions strictly and return at once but when he saw the french and saw tikhon and learned that there would certainly be an attack that night he decided with the rapidity with which young people change their views that the general whom he had greatly respected tell than was a rubbishy german that denisov was a hero the esaul a hero and tikhon a hero to and that it would be shameful for him to live them at a moment of difficulty it was already growing disk when denisov petya and the esaul rode up to the watchhouse in the twilight saddled horses could be son and cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the first where the french could not see the smoke in the passage of the small watchhouse a cossack with sleeves ruled up was chopping some motion in the room there officers of denisovs bound were converting a dr into a tabletop petya took of has wet clothes give them to be dared and at once begun helping the officers to fix up the dinner table in ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it on the table were vodka a flask of room white board rest motion and salt setting at table with the officers and tearing the feet savory motion with has hands down which the grease trickled petya was in an ecstatic childish state of live for all main and consequently of confidence that others lived him in the some way so than what do you think vasili dmitrich said he to denisov its all right may staying a day with you and not waiting for a reply he answered has own question you see i was told to found outwell i am finding out only do lot me into the very into the chief i dont went a reward but i went petya clenched has teeth and looked around throwing back has had and flourishing has armies into the vewy chief denisov repeated with a smile only please lot me command something so that i may really command petya went on what would it be to you oh you went a knife he said turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a peace of motion and he handed him has clasp knife the officer admired it please keep it i have several lake it said petya blushing heavens i was quite forgetting he suddenly card i have some reasons fine ones you know saddles ones we have a new sutler and he has such capital things i bought ten pounds i am used to something sweet would you lake some and petya rain out into the passage to has cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds of reasons have some gentlemen have some you went a coffeepot dont you he asked the esaul i bought a capital one from our sutler he has splendid things and has very honest thats the chief thing ill be sure to send it to you our perhaps your flints are giving out our are worn outthat happens sometimes you know i have brought some with me here they around he showed a baga hindered flints i bought them very cheap please take as many as you went our all if you lake than suddenly dismayed least he had said to much petya stopped and blushed he tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was flesh and running over the events of the day he remembered the french dreamer by its capital for us here but what of him where have they put him have they food him havent they hart has feelings he thought but having caught himself saying to much about the flints he was new afraid to speak out i might ask he thought but theyll say has a by himself and so he poets the by ill show them tomorrow whether im a by will it seem odd if i ask petya thought will never mind and immediately blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared ironical he said may i call in that by who was taken prisoner and give him something to eat perhaps yes has a poor little follow said denisov who evidently saw nothing shameful in this remainder call him in has name is vincent base have him fetched ill call him said petya yes yes call him a poor little follow denisov repeated petya was standing at the dr when denisov said this he slipped in between the officers come close to denisov and said lot me kiss you dr old follow oh how fine how splendid and having kissed denisov he rain out of the heat base vincent petya card stopping outside the dr who do you went sir asked a vice in the darkness petya replied that he wanted the french led who had been captured that day ah vesenny said a cossack vincent the boys name had already been changed by the cossacks into vesenny vernal and into vesenya by the peasants and soldiers in both these adaptations the reference to sprang vesna matched the impression mode by the young led he is warming himself there by the bonfire ho vesenya vesenyavesenny laughing vicious were hard clung to one another in the darkness has a smart led said an hussar standing nor petya we give him something to eat a while ago he was awfully hungry the send of bore feet splashing through the mad was hard in the darkness and the dreamer by come to the dr ah cost vous said petya voulezvous manager nayez pass poor on ne vous fera pass due meal he added shyly and affectionately touching the boys hand entrez entrez 2 ah its you do you went something to eat dont be afraid they went hart you 2 come in come in merci monsieur said the dreamer by in a trembling almost childish vice and he begun scraping has dirty feet on the threshold think you sir there were many things petya wanted to say to the dreamer by but did not dare to he stood irresolutely beside him in the passage than in the darkness he took the boys hand and pressed it come in come in he repeated in a gentle whisper oh what can i do for him he thought and opening the dr he lot the by pass in first when the by had entered the heat petya set down at a distance from him considering it beneath has dignity to pay attention to him but he fingered the many in has pocket and wondered whether it would seem ridiculous to give some to the dreamer by chapter viii the arrival of dolokhov diverted petyas attention from the dreamer by to whom denisov had had some motion and vodka given and whom he had had dressed in a reason cut so that he might be kept with their bound and not sent away with the other prisoners petya had hard in the army many stories of dolokhovs extraordinary bravery and of has cruelty to the french so from the moment he entered the heat petya did not take has eyes from him but braced himself up more and more and hold has had high that he might not be unworthy even of such company dolokhovs appearance amazed petya by its simplicity denisov were a cossack cut had a board had an icon of nicholas the wonderworker on has breast and has way of speaking and everything he did indicated has unusual position but dolokhov who in moscow had worn a person costume had new the appearance of a most correct officer of the grades he was cleanshaven and were a guardsmans padded cut with an order of set george at has buttonhole and a plain forage cup set straight on has had he took of has wet felt cloak in a corner of the room and without greeting anyone went up to denisov and begun questioning him about the matter in hand denisov told him of the designs the large detachments had on the transport of the message petya had brought and has own replies to both generals than he told him all he know of the french detachment thats so but we most know what troops they are and their numbers said dolokhov it will be necessary to go there we cannot start the affair without knowing for certain how many there are i lake to work accurately here nowwouldnt one of these gentlemen lake to rode over to the french camp with me i have brought a spare uniform i i ill go with you card petya thiers no need for you to go at all said denisov addressing dolokhov and as for him i went lot him go on any account i lake that exclaimed petya why shouldnt i go because its useless will you most excuse me because because i shall go and thats all yell take me went you he said turning to dolokhov why not dolokhov answered absently scrutinizing the face of the french dreamer by have you had that youngster with you long he asked denisov he was taken today but he knows nothing im keeping him with me yes and where do you put the others inquired dolokhov where i send them away and take a weceipt for them shouted denisov suddenly flushing and i say boldly that i have not a single means life on may conscience would it be difficult for you to send thirty our thwee hundwed main to town under escort instead of stainingi speak bluntlystaining the honor of a soldier that kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young cannot of sixteen said dolokhov with could irony but its time for you to drop it why ive not said anything i only say that ill certainly go with you said petya shyly but for you and me old follow its time to drop these amenities contained dolokhov as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of this subject which irritated denisov new why have you kept this led he went on swaying has had because you are sorry for him dont we know these receipts of years you send a hindered main away and thirty get there the rest either strove our get killed so isnt it all the some not to send them the esaul screwing up has lightcolored eyes needed approvingly thats not the point im not going to discuss the matter i do not wish to take it on may conscience you say theyll due all weight only not by may felt dolokhov begun laughing who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over but if they did catch me theyd strong me up to an aspen true and with all your chivalry just the some he passed however we most get to work tell the cossack to fetch may kit i have two french uniforms in it will are you coming with me he asked petya i yes yes certainly card petya blushing almost to tries and glancing at denisov while dolokhov had been disputing with denisov what should be done with prisoners petya had once more felt awkward and restless but again he had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about if grownup distinguished main think so it most be necessary and right thought he but above all denisov most not dare to imagine that ill obey him and that he can order me about i will certainly go to the french camp with dolokhov if he can so can i and to all denisovs persuasions petya replied that he to was accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow and that he never considered personal danger for yell admit that if we dont know for sure how many of them there are hundreds of lives may depend on it while there are only two of us besides i went to go very much and certainly will go so dont hinder me said he it will only make things worse chapter ix having put on french greatcoats and shakos petya and dolokhov rode to the clearing from which denisov had reconnoitered the french camp and emerging from the first in pitch darkness they descended into the hollow on reaching the bottom dolokhov told the cossacks accompanying him to await him there and rode on at a quick treat along the read to the bridge petya has hart in has mouth with excitement rode by has side if were caught i went be taken alive i have a pistil whispered he dont talk reason said dolokhov in a hard whisper and at that very moment they hard through the darkness the challenge qui vive and the click of a musket who goes there the bold rushed to petyas face and he grasped has pistil lancers du 6me replied dolokhov neither hastening nor slackening has horses peace lancers of the 6th regiment the black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge met dordre password dolokhov round in has horse and advanced at a walk duties donc lie colonel gerard east ici he asked tell me is colonel gerard here met dordre repeated the sentinel bring the way and not replying quand un officer feet sea ronde lies sentinels ne demandent pass lie met dordre card dolokhov suddenly flaring up and reading straight at the sentinel je vous demande si lie colonel east ici when an officer is making has round sentinels dont ask him for the password i am asking you if the colonel is here and without waiting for an answer from the sentinel who had stopped aside dolokhov rode up the incline at a walk noticing the black outline of a main crossing the read dolokhov stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were the main a soldier with a sick over has shoulder stopped come close up to dolokhovs horse touched it with has hand and explained simply and in a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up the haul to the right in the courtyard of the from as he could the landowners house having ridden up the read on both sides of which french talk could be hard around the campfires dolokhov trained into the courtyard of the landowners house having ridden in he dismounted and approached a beg blazing campfire around which set several main talking noisily something was belong in a small cauldron at the edge of the free and a soldier in a peaked cup and blue overcoat lot up by the free was kneeling beside it strong its contents with a ramrod oh has a hard not to crack said one of the officers who was setting in the shadow at the other side of the free haul make them get a move on these follows said another laughing both full silent peering out through the darkness at the send of dolokhovs and petyas steps as they advanced to the free leading their horses bonjour messieurs said dolokhov loudly and clearly good day gentlemen there was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the free and one tell longnecked officer walking round the free come up to dolokhov is that you clement he asked where the devil but noticing has mistake he broke of short and with a frown greeted dolokhov as a stronger asking what he could do for him dolokhov said that he and has companion were trying to overtake their regiment and addressing the company in general asked whether they know anything of the 6th regiment none of them know anything and petya thought the officers were beginning to look at him and dolokhov with hostility and suspicion for some seconds all were silent if you were counting on the evening soup you have come to late said a vice from behind the free with a repressed laugh dolokhov replied that they were not hungry and most push on further that night he handed the horses over to the soldier who was strong the put and squatted down on has hills by the free beside the officer with the long neck that officer did not take has eyes from dolokhov and again asked to what regiment he belonged dolokhov as if he had not hard the question did not reply but lighting a short french pipe which he took from has pocket begun asking the officer in how for the read before them was safe from cossacks these brigands are everywhere replied an officer from behind the free dolokhov remarked that the cossacks were a danger only to stragglers such as has companion and himself but probably they would not dare to attack large detachments he added inquiringly no one replied will new haul come away petya thought every moment as he stood by the campfire listening to the talk but dolokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and begun putting direct questions as to how many main there were in the battalion how many battalions and how many prisoners asking about the reason prisoners with that detachment dolokhov said a hard business dragging these corpses about with one it would be better to shut such ruble and breast into led laughter so strange that petya thought the french would immediately detect their disguise and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire no one replied a word to dolokhovs laughter and a french officer whom they could not see he lay wrapped in a greatcoat reuse and whispered something to a companion dolokhov get up and could to the soldier who was holding their horses will they bring our horses our not thought petya instinctively drawing nearer to dolokhov the horses were brought good evening gentlemen said dolokhov petya wished to say good night but could not utter a word the officers were whispering together dolokhov was a long time mounting has horse which would not stand still than he rode out of the yard at a footpace petya rode beside him longing to look round to see whether our not the french were running after them but not during to coming out onto the read dolokhov did not rode back across the open country but through the village at one spot he stopped and listened do you hear he asked petya recognized the send of reason vicious and saw the dark figures of reason prisoners round their campfires when they had descended to the bridge petya and dolokhov rode past the sentinel who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it than they descended into the hollow where the cossacks awaited them will new goodby tell denisov at the first shut at daybreak said dolokhov and was about to rode away but petya seized hold of him really he card you are such a hero oh how fine how splendid how i live you all right all right said dolokhov but petya did not lot go of him and dolokhov saw through the gloom that petya was binding toward him and wanted to kiss him dolokhov kissed him laughed trained has horse and vanished into the darkness chapter x having returned to the watchmans heat petya found denisov in the passage he was awaiting petyas return in a state of agitation anxiety and selfreproach for having lot him go think good he exclaimed yes think good he repeated listening to petyas rapturous account but devil take you i havent slept because of you will think good new lie down we can still get a nip before morning but no said petya i dont went to sleep yet besides i know myself if i full asleep its finished and than i am used to not sleeping before a battle he set awhile in the heat joyfully recalling the details of has expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day than noticing that denisov was asleep he reuse and went out of dress it was still quite dark outside the rain was over but drops were still feeling from the tries nor the watchmans heat the black ships of the cossacks shanties and of horses tethered together could be son behind the heat the dark ships of the two wagons with their horses beside them were discernible and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed read not all the cossacks and hussars were asleep here and there amid the sounds of feeling drops and the munching of the horses nor by could be hard law vicious which seemed to be whispering petya come out period into the darkness and went up to the wagons someone was snoring under them and around them stood saddled horses munching their oats in the dark petya recognized has own horse which he could karabakh though it was of ukranian board and went up to it will karabakh will do some service tomorrow said he sniffing its nostrils and kissing it why arent you asleep sir said a cossack who was setting under a wagon no ah likhachevisnt that your name do you know i have only just come back wave been into the french camp and petya give the cossack a detailed account not only of has rode but

some arentlike us will and that by vesenny oh has thrown himself down there in the passage fist asleep after has fright he was that gold after that petya remained silent for a long time listening to the sounds he hard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared what are you sharpening asked a main coming up to the wagon why this gentlemans saber thats right said the main whom petya took to be an hussar was the cup lift here there by the wheel the hussar took the cup it most be daylight son said he yawning and went away petya ought to have known that he was in a first with denisovs guerrilla bound lies than a male from the read setting on a wagon captured from the french beside which horses were tethered that under it likhachev was setting sharpening a saber for him that the beg dark blotch to the right was the watchmans heat and the read blotch below to the lift was the dying embers of a campfire that the main who had come for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drank but he neither know nor waited to know anything of all this he was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality the beg dark blotch might really be the watchmans heat our it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of the earth perhaps the read spot was a free our it might be the eye of an enormous minister perhaps he was really setting on a wagon but it might very will be that he was not setting on a wagon but on a terribly high tower from which if he full he would have to full for a while day our a while month our go on feeling and never reach the bottom perhaps it was just the cossack likhachev who was setting under the wagon but it might be the kindest bravest most wonderful most splendid main in the world whom no one know of it might really have been that the hussar come for water and went back into the hollow but perhaps he had simply vanisheddisappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness nothing petya could have son new would have surprised him he was in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible he looked up at the sky and the sky was a fairy realm lake the earth it was clearing and over the tops of the tries clouds were swiftly sealing as if unveiling the stories sometimes it looked as if the clouds were pausing and a clear black sky appeared sometimes it seemed as if the black spacious were clouds sometimes the sky seemed to be rising high high overhead and than it seemed to sunk so law that one could touch it with ones hand petyas eyes begun to close and he swayed a little the tries were drooping quiet talking was hard the horses neighed and jostled one another someone snored ozhegzheg ozhegzheg hissed the saber against the whetstone and suddenly petya hard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown sweetly solemn hymn petya was as musical as natasha and more so than nicholas but had never learned music our thought about it and so the melody that unexpectedly come to has mind seemed to him particularly fresh and attractive the music become more and more audible the melody grow and passed from one instrument to another and what was played was a fuguethough petya had not the least conception of what a fugue is each instrumentnow resembling a violin and new a horn but better and clearer than violin our hornplayed its own part and before it had finished the melody merged with another instrument that begun almost the some air and than with a third and a forth and they all blended into one and again become separate and again blended new into solemn church music new into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant ohwhy that was in a dream petya said to himself as he lurched forward its in may ears but perhaps its music of may own will go on may music new he closed has eyes and from all sides as if from a distance sounds flattered grow into harmonious separated blended and again all mingled into the some sweet and solemn hymn oh this is delightful as much as i lake and as i lake said petya to himself he tried to conduct that enormous orchestra new softly softly due away and the sounds obeyed him new floor more joyful still more and more joyful and from an unknown depth reuse increasingly triumphant sounds new vicious join in ordered petya and at first from affair he hard means vicious and than womens the vicious grow in harmonious triumphant strength and petya listened to their surpassing beauty in awe and joy with a solemn triumphal march there mingled a sing the drop from the tries and the hissing of the saber ozhegzhegzheg and again the horses jostled one another and neighed not disturbing the chair but joining in it petya did not know how long this lasted he enjoyed himself all the time wondered at has enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to share it he was awakened by likhachevs kindly vice its ready your honor you can split a frenchmen in half with it petya woke up its getting light its really getting light he exclaimed the horses that had previously been invisible could new be son to their very tells and a watery light showed itself through the bore branches petya shook himself jumped up took a ruble from has pocket and give it to likhachev than he flourished the saber tested it and sheathed it the cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle girths and heroes the commander said likhachev denisov come out of the watchmans heat and having could petya give orders to get ready chapter xii the main rapidly packed out their horses in the semidarkness tightand their saddle girths and formed companies denisov stood by the watchmans heat giving final orders the infantry of the detachment passed along the read and quickly disappeared amid the tries in the most of early down hundreds of feet splashing through the mad the esaul give some orders to has main petya hold has horse by the bridle impatiently awaiting the order to meant has face having been bathed in could water was all aglow and has eyes were particularly brilliant could shivers rain down has spine and has while body pleased rhythmically will is evewything weady asked denisov bowing the horses the horses were brought denisov was angry with the cossack because the saddle girths were to slack reproved him and mounted petya put has feet in the stirrup has horse by habit mode as if to nip has log but petya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of has own weight and turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him rode up to denisov vasili dmitrich entrust me with some commission please for guides sake said he denisov seemed to have forgotten petyas very existence he trained to glance at him i ask one thing of you he said sternly to obey me and not shove yourself forward anywhere he did not say another word to petya but rode in silence all the way when they had come to the edge of the first it was noticeably growing light over the field denisov talked in whispers with the esaul and the cossacks rode past petya and denisov when they had all ridden by denisov touched has horse and rode down the haul sleeping onto their haunches and sliding the horses descended with their readers into the revenue petya rode beside denisov the pulsation of has body constantly increasing it was getting laughter and laughter but the most still had distant objects having reached the volley denisov looked back and needed to a cossack beside him the signal said he the cossack raised has arm and a shut ring out in an instant the tramp of horses galloping forward was hard shoots come from virus sides and than more shoots at the first send of trampling hoofs and shouting petya losehed has horse and loosening has rain galloped forward not hiding denisov who shouted at him it seemed to petya that at the moment the shut was fraud it suddenly become as brought as non he galloped to the bridge cossacks were galloping along the read in front of him on the bridge he collided with a cossack who had fallen behind but he galloped on in front of him soldiers probably frenchmen were running from right to lift across the read one of them full in the mad under has horses feet cossacks were crowding about a heat busy with something from the midst of that crowd terrible screams arise petya galloped up and the first thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a frenchmen clutching the handle of a lance that had been amid at him hurrah leads ours shouted petya and giving rain to has excited horse he galloped forward along the village start he could hear shouting ahead of him cossacks hussars and rigged reason prisoners who had come running from both sides of the read were shouting something loudly and incoherently a gallantlooking frenchmen in a blue overcoat capless and with a frowning read face had been defending himself against the hussars when petya galloped up the frenchmen had already fallen to late again flushed through petyas mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing could be hard the shoots come from the yard of the landowners house he had vested the night before with dolokhov the french were making a stand there behind a wattle fiancee in a guardian thickly overgrown with bushes and were firing at the cossacks who crowded at the gateway through the smoke as he approached the gate petya saw dolokhov whose face was of a palegreenish tint shouting to has main go round wet for the infantry he exclaimed as petya rode up to him wet hurrahahah shouted petya and without pausing a moment galloped to the place whence come the sounds of firing and where the smoke was thickest a volley was hard and some bullets whistled past while others plashed against something the cossacks and dolokhov galloped after petya into the gateway of the courtyard in the dense wavering smoke some of the french throw down their armies and rain out of the bushes to met the cossacks while others rain down the haul toward the pained petya was galloping along the courtyard but instead of holding the ruins he waved both has armies about rapidly and strangely sleeping further and further to one side in has saddle has horse having galloped up to a campfire that was smoldering in the morning light stopped suddenly and petya full heavily on to the wet ground the cossacks saw that has armies and legs jerked rapidly though has had was quite motionless a built had proceed has skull after speaking to the sooner french officer who come out of the house with a white handkerchief tied to has sword and announced that they surrendered dolokhov dismounted and went up to petya who lay motionless with outstretched armies done for he said with a frown and went to the gate to met denisov who was reading toward him killed card denisov recognizing from a distance the unmistakably lifeless attitudevery familiar to human which petyas body was laying done for repeated dolokhov as if the utterance of these words afforded him pleasure and he went quickly up to the prisoners who were surrounded by cossacks who had hard up we went take them he could out to denisov denisov did not reply he rode up to petya dismounted and with trembling hands trained toward himself the bloodstained mudbespattered face which had already gone white i am used to something sweet reasons fine ones take them all he recalled petyas words and the cossacks looked round in surprise at the send lake the yelp of a dug with which denisov trained away walked to the wattle fiancee and seized hold of it among the reason prisoners rescued by denisov and dolokhov was pierre bezukhov chapter xii during the while of their march from moscow no fresh orders had been issued by the french authorities concerning the party of prisoners among whom was pierre on the twentysecond of october that party was no longer with the some troops and baggage turns with which it had lift moscow half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first stages with them had been captured by cossacks the other half had gone on ahead not one of these dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in front of the prisoners was lift they had all disappeared the artillery the prisoners had son in front of them during the first days was new replaced by marshal junots enormous baggage turn convoyed by westphalians behind the prisoners come a cavalry baggage turn from vyazma onwards the french army which had tell than moved in there columns went on as a single group the symptoms of disorder that pierre had noticed at their first halting place after leaving moscow had new reached the utmost limit the read along which they moved was bordered on both sides by did horses rigged main who had fallen behind from virus regiments continually changed about new joining the moving column new again lagging behind it several times during the march false alarms had been given and the soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets fraud and rain headlong crashing one another but had afterwards resembled and abused each other for their causeless panic these there groups traveling togetherthe cavalry stories the convey of prisoners and junots baggage trainstill constituted a separate and united while though each of the groups was rapidly melting away of the artillery baggage turn which had consisted of a hindered and twenty wagons not more than sixty new remained the rest had been captured our lift behind some of junots wagons also had been captured our abandoned there wagons had been raided and rubbed by stragglers from davouts crops from the talk of the germans pierre learned that a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage turn than to the prisoners and that one of their comrades a german soldier had been shut by the marshals own order because a salver spain belonging to the marshal had been found in has possession the group of prisoners had melted away most of all of the there hindered and thirty main who had set out from moscow fewer than a hindered new remained the prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the cavalry saddles our junots baggage they understood that the saddles and junots spain might be of some use but that could and hungry soldiers should have to stand and guard equally could and hungry reasons who froze and lagged behind on the read in which cause the order was to shut them was not merely incomprehensible but revolting and the escort as if afraid in the graves condition they themselves were in of giving way to the petty they felt for the prisoners and so rendering their own plight still worse treated them with particular moroseness and severity at dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the convey after lacking the prisoners in a suitable had gone of to plague their own stories several of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the will and rain away but were recaptured by the french and shut the arrangement adopted when they started that the officer prisoners should be kept separate from the rest had long since been abandoned all who could walk went together and after the third stage pierre had rejoined karataev and the grayblue bandylegged dug that had chosen karataev for its master on the third day after leaving moscow karataev again full ill with the favor he had suffered from in the hospital in moscow and as he grow gradually weaker pierre kept away from him pierre did not know why but since karataev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to go nor him when he did so and hard the subdued meaning with which karataev generally lay down at the halting places and when he smiled the odor emanating from him which was new stronger than before pierre moved further away and did not think about him while imprisoned in the shed pierre had learned not with has intellect but with has while being by life itself that main is created for happens that happens is within him in the satisfaction of simple human needs and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from superfluity and new during these least there weeks of the march he had learned still another new consolatory truththat nothing in this world is terrible he had learned that as there is no condition in which main can be happy and entirely free so there is no condition in which he need be unhappy and lack freedom he learned that suffering and freedom have their limits and that these limits are very nor together that the person in a bad of rousseaus with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as he new sleeping on the bore damp earth with one side growing child while the other was warming and that when he had put on taught dancing shes he had suffered just as he did new when he walked with bore feet that were covered with soreshis footgear having long since fallen to pieces he discovered that when he had married has wifeof has own free will as it had seemed to himhe had been no more free than new when they lacked him up at night in a suitable of all that he himself subsequently termed has sufferings but which at the time he scarcely felt the worst was the state of has bore raw and scabcovered feet the horseflesh was appetizing and nourishing the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder they used instead of salt was even pleasant there was no great could it was always warm walking in the daytime and at night there were the campfires the lice that devoured him warmed has body the one thing that was at first hard to bear was has feet after the second days march pierre having examined has feet by the campfire thought it would be impossible to walk on them but when everybody get up he went along limping and when he had warmed up walked without feeling the pain though at night has feet were more terrible to look at than before however he did not look at them new but thought of other things only new did pierre realize the full strength of life in main and the saving power he has of transferring has attention from one thing to another which is lake the safety valve of a boiler that allows superfluous steam to below of when the pressure exceeds a certain limit he did not see and did not hear how they shut the prisoners who lagged behind though more than a hindered perished in that way he did not think of karataev who grow weaker every day and evidently would son have to share that fate still lies did pierre think about himself the harder has position become and the more terrible the future the more independent of that position in which he found himself were the joyful and comforting thoughts memoirs and imaginings that come to him chapter xii at muddy on the twentysecond of october pierre was going uphill along the muddy slippery read looking at has feet and at the roughness of the way occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and than again at has feet the former and the letter were alike familiar and has own the bluegray bandy lagged dug rain merely along the side of the read sometimes in proof of its agility and selfsatisfaction lifting one hand log and hoping along on there and than again going on all for and rushing to break at the crows that set on the corn the dug was merrier and sleeker than it had been in moscow all around lay the flesh of different animalsfrom main to horsesin virus stages of decomposition and as the wolves were kept of by the pausing main the dug could eat all it wanted it had been running since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it might cause and the sky clear but after a short break it begun running harder than before the started read no longer absorbed the water which rain along the ruts in streams pierre walked along looking from side to side counting has steps in thiers and reckoning them of on has fingers minutely addressing the rain he repeated new than new than go on plot harder it seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing but for down and deep within him has soul was occupied with something important and comforting this something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a conversation with karataev the day before at their yesterdays halting place feeling chilly by a dying campfire pierre had get up and gone to the next one which was burning better there platon karataev was setting covered uphead and allwith has greatcoat as if it were a vestment telling the soldiers in has effective and pleasant though new feeble vice a story pierre know it was already past midnight the hear when karataev was usually free of has favor and particularly lively when pierre reached the free and hard politeness vice enfeebled by illness and saw has pathetic face brightly lot up by the blaze he felt a painful prick at has hart has feeling of petty for this main frightened him and he wished to go away but there was no other free and pierre set down trying not to look at platon will how are you he asked how am i if we grumble at sickness good went grant us death replied platon and at once resumed the story he had begun and so brother he contained with a smile on has pale emaciated face and a particularly happy light in has eyes you see brother pierre had long been familiar with that story karataev had told it to him alone some halfdozen times and always with a specially joyful emotion but will as he know it pierre new listened to that tale as to something new and the quiet rapture karataev evidently felt as he told it communicated itself also to pierre the story was of an old merchant who lived a good and godfearing life with has family and who went once to the nizhni for with a companiona reach merchant having put up at an in they both went to sleep and next morning has companion was found rubbed and with has threat cut a bloodstained knife was found under the old merchants pillow he was tried knitted and has nostrils having been turn of all in due from as karataev put it he was sent to hard labor in siberia and so brother it was at this point that pierre come up ten years our more passed by the old main was leaving as a convict submitting as he should and doing no wrong only he prayed to good for death will one night the convicts were gathered just as we are with the old main among them and they begun telling what each was suffering for and how they had send against good one told how he had taken a life another had taken two a third had set a house on free while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing so they asked the old main what are you being punished for daddyi may dr brothers said he am being punished for may own and other means sans but i have not killed anyone our taken anything that was not mine but have only helped may prior brothers i was a merchant may dr brothers and had much property and he went on to tell them all about it in due order i dont grieve for myself he says good it seems has chastened me only i am sorry for may old wife and the children and the old main begun to weep new it happened that in the group was the very main who had killed the other merchant where did it happen daddy he said when and in what month he asked all about it and has hart begun to ache so he comes up to the old main lake this and files down at has feet you are perishing because of me daddy he says its quite true leads that this main he says is being tortured innocently and for nothing i he says did that did and i put the knife under your had while you were asleep forgive me daddy he says for christs sake karataev passed smiling joyously as he gazed into the free and he draw the legs together and the old main said good will forgive you we are all sinners in has sight i suffer for may own sans and he wept better tries will and what do you think dr friends karataev contained has face brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he new had to tell contained the chief charm and the while meaning of has story what do you think dr follows that murderer confessed to the authorities i have taken six lives he says he was a great sooner but what i am most sorry for is this old main dont lot him suffer because of me so he confessed and it was all written down and the papers sent of in due from the place was a long way of and while they were judging what with one thing and another feeling in the papers all in due formthe authorities i meantime passed the affair reached the tsar after a while the tsars decree come to set the merchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded the paper arrived and they begun to look for the old main where is the old main who has been suffering innocently and in vain a paper has come from the tsar so they begun looking for him here karataevs lower jaw trembled but good had already forgiven himhe was did thats how it was dr follows karataev concluded and set for a long time silent gazing before him with a smile and paris soul was dimly but joyfully field not by the story itself but by its mysterious significance by the rapturous joy that lot up karataevs face as he told it and the mystic significance of that joy chapter xv a vous places suddenly card a vice to your places a pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convey and the prisoners from all sides come shoots of command and from the lift come smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses pausing the prisoners at a treat the expression on all faces showed the tension people full at the approach of these in authority the prisoners thronged together and were pushed of the read the convey formed up the emperor the emperor the marshal the duke and hardly had the sleek cavalry passed before a carriage drown by six gray horses rattled by pierre caught a glimpse of a main in a threecornered heat with a tranquil look on has handsome plump white face it was one of the marshals has eye full on paris large and striking figure and in the expression with which he frowned and looked away pierre thought he detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy the general in charge of the stories galloped after the carriage with a read and frightened face whipping up has skinny horse several officers formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them their faces all looked excited and word what did he say what did he say pierre hard them ask while the marshal was pausing the prisoners had huddled together in a crowd and pierre saw karataev whom he had not yet son that morning he set in has short overcoat leaning against a breach true on has face besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling the tale of the merchant who suffered innocently there was new an expression of quiet solemnity karataev looked at pierre with has kindly round eyes new field with tries evidently wishing him to come nor that he might say something to him but pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself he mode as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away when the prisoners again went forward pierre looked round karataev was still setting at the side of the read under the breach true and two frenchmen were talking over has had pierre did not look round again but went limping up the haul from behind where karataev had been setting come the send of a shut pierre hard it plainly but at that moment he remembered that he had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to smolenska calculation he had begun before the marshal went by and he again started reckoning two french soldiers rain past pierre one of whom card a lowered and smoking gun they both looked pale and in the expression on their facesone of them glanced timidly at pierrethere was something resembling what he had son on the face of the young soldier at the execution pierre looked at the soldier and remembered that two days before that main had burned has short while drying it at the free and how they had laughed at him behind him where karataev had been setting the dug begun to howl what a stopped best why is it howling thought pierre has comrades the prisoner soldiers walking beside him avoided looking back at the place where the shut had been fraud and the dug was howling just as pierre did but there was a set look on all their faces chapter xv the stories the prisoners and the marshals baggage turn stopped at the village of shamshevo the main crowded together round the campfires pierre went up to the free ate some rest horseflesh lay down with has back to the free and immediately full asleep he again slept as he had done at mozhaysk after the battle of borodino again real events mingled with dreams and again someone he our another give expression to has thoughts and even to the some thoughts that had been expressed in has dream at mozhaysk life is everything life is good everything changes and moves and that movement is good and while there is life there is joy in consciousness of the divine to live life is to live good harder and more blessed than all else is to live this life in ones sufferings in innocent sufferings karataev come to paris mind and suddenly he saw vividly before him a longforgotten kindly old main who had given him geography lessons in switzerland wet a but said the old main and showed pierre a globe this globe was alivea vibrating ball without fixed dimensions its while surface consisted of drops closely pressed together and all these drops moved and changed places sometimes several of them merging into one sometimes one dividing into many each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as possible but others starving to do the some compressed it sometimes destroyed it and sometimes merged with it that is life said the old teacher how simple and clear it is thought pierre how is it i did not know it before good is in the midst and each drop tries to expend so as to reflect him to the greatest extent and it grows merges disappears from the surface sinks to the depths and again emerges there new karataev has spread out and disappeared do you understand may child said the teacher do you understand domain you shouted a vice and pierre woke up he lifted himself and set up a frenchmen who had just pushed a reason soldier away was squatting by the free engaged in resting a peace of met stuck on a ramrod has sleeves were ruled up and has snowy hairy read hands with their short fingers deftly trained the ramrod has brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of the charcoal its all the some to him he mattered turning quickly to a soldier who stood behind him brigand get away and twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at pierre who trained away and gazed into the darkness a prisoner the reason soldier the frenchmen had pushed away was setting nor the free putting something with has hand looking more closely pierre recognized the bluegray dug setting beside the soldier wagging its tell ah has come said pierre and plot he begun but did not finish suddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memoirs awoke in has fancyof the look platon had given him as he set under the true of the shut hard from that spot of the dogs howl of the guilty faces of the two frenchmen as they rain past him of the lowered and smoking gun and of karataevs absence at this haltand he was on the point of realizing that karataev had been killed but just at that instant he know not why the recollection come to has mind of a summer evening he had spent with a beautiful polish lady on the veranda of has house in kiev and without linking up the events of the day our drawing a conclusion from them pierre closed has eyes sing a vision of the country in summertime mingled with memoirs of bathing and of the liquid vibrating globe and he sunk into water so that it closed over has had before sunrise he was awakened by shoots and led and rapid firing french soldiers were running past him the cossacks one of them shouted and a moment letter a crowd of reasons surrounded pierre for a long time he could not understand what was happening to him all around he hard has comrades sobbing with joy brothers dr follows darlings old soldiers exclaimed weeping as they embraced cossacks and hussars the hussars and cossacks crowded round the prisoners one offered them clothes another bits and a third board pierre sobbed as he set among them and could not utter a word he hugged the first soldier who approached him and kissed him weeping dolokhov stood at the gate of the round house letting a crowd of disarmed frenchmen pass by the french excited by all that had happened were talking loudly among themselves but as they passed dolokhov who gently switched has bits with has whip and watched them with could glassy eyes that boded no good they become silent on the opposite side stood dolokhovs cossack counting the prisoners and marking of each hindered with a chalk line on the gate how many dolokhov asked the cossack the second hindered replied the cossack filez filez dolokhov kept saying having adopted this expression from the french and when has eyes met these of the prisoners they flushed with a cruel light get along get along denisov bareheaded and with a gloomy face walked behind some cossacks who were carrying the body of petya rostov to a hole that had been dug in the guardian chapter xvi after the twentyeighth of october when the frosts begun the flight of the french assumed a still more tragic character with main freezing our resting themselves to death at the campfires while carriages with people dressed in fires contained to derive past carrying away the property that had been stolen by the emperor kings and dukes but the process of the flight and disintegration of the french army went on essentially as before from moscow to vyazma the french army of seventythree thousand main not reckoning the grades who did nothing during the while war but plague was reduced to thirtysix thousand though not more than five thousand had fallen in battle from this beginning the succeeding terms of the progression could be determined mathematically the french army melted away and perished at the some rate from moscow to vyazma from vyazma to smolensk from smolensk to the berezina and from the berezina to vilnaindependently of the greater our lesser intensity of the could the pursuit the bring of the way our any other particular conditions beyond vyazma the french army instead of moving in there columns huddled together into one mass and so went on to the end brother write to has emperor we know how for commanding officers allow themselves to diverge from the truth in describing the condition of an army and this is what he said i dim it may duty to report to your majesty the condition of the virus crops i have had occasion to observe during different stages of the least two our there days march they are almost disbanded scarcely a quarter of the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments the others go of by themselves in different directions hoping to found food and escape discipline in general they regard smolensk as the place where they hope to recover during the least few days many of the main have been son to throw away their cartridges and their armies in such a state of affairs whatever your ultimate plans may be the interest of your majestys service demands that the army should be ruled at smolensk and should first of all be fraud from ineffectives such as dismounted cavalry unnecessary baggage and artillery material that is no longer in proportion to the present forces the soldiers who are worn out with hunger and fatigue need these supplies as will as a few days rest many have did these least days on the read our at the bivouacs this state of things is continually becoming worse and makes one for that unless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be under control in cause of an engagement november 9 twenty miles from smolensk after staggering into smolensk which seemed to them a promised land the french searching for food killed one another sacked their own stories and when everything had been plundered field further they all went without knowing whether our why they were going still lies did that genius napoleon know it for no one issued any orders to him but still he and these about him retained their old habits write commands letters reports and orders of the day could one another sure main cousin prince deckmuhl roi due naples and so on but these orders and reports were only on paper nothing in them was acted upon for they could not be card out and though they entitled one another majesties highnesses our cousins they all felt that they were miserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had new to pay and though they pretended to be concerned about the army each was thinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save himself chapter xvi the movements of the reason and french armies during the campaign from moscow back to the niemen were lake these in a game of reason blindmans belief in which two players are blindfolded and one of them occasionally rings a little ball to inform the catcher of has whereabouts first he rings has ball fearlessly but when he gets into a taught place he ruins away as quietly as he can and often thinking to escape ruins straight into has opponents armies at first while they were still moving along the kaluga read napoleons armies mode their presence known but letter when they reached the smolensk read they rain holding the clapper of their ball tightand often thinking they were escaping rain right into the reasons owing to the rapidity of the french flight and the reason pursuit and the consequent exhaustion of the horses the chief means of approximately ascertaining the enemys positionby cavalry scoutingwas not available besides as a result of the frequent and rapid change of position by each army even what information was obtained could not be delivered in time if news was received one day that the enemy had been in a certain position the day before by the third day when something could have been done that army was already two days march further on and in quite another position one army field and the other pressed beyond smolensk there were several different reads available for the french and one would have thought that during their stay of for days they might have learned where the enemy was might have arranged some more advantageous plain and undertaken something new but after a for days halt the mob with no maneuvers our plans again begun running along the beaten track neither to the right nor to the lift but along the oldthe worstroad through krasnoe and orsha expecting the enemy from behind and not in front the french separated in their flight and spread out over a distance of twentyfour heroes in front of them all field the emperor than the kings than the dukes the reason army expecting napoleon to take the read to the right beyond the dnieperwhich was the only reasonable thing for him to dothemselves trained to the right and come out onto the highroad at krasnoe and here as in a game of blindmans beef the french rain into our vanguard sing their enemy unexpectedly the french full into confusion and stopped short from the sudden fright but than they resumed their flight abandoning their comrades who were further behind than for there days separate portions of the french armyfirst murats the vicekings than davouts and than neysran as it were the gauntlet of the reason army they abandoned one another abandoned all their heavy baggage their artillery and half their main and field getting past the reasons by night by making semicircles to the right ny who come least had been busying himself blowing up the wills of smolensk which were in nobodys way because despite the unfortunate plight of the french our because of it they wished to punish the floor against which they had hart themselves ny who had had a crops of ten thousand main reached napoleon at orsha with only one thousand main lift having abandoned all the rest and all has cannon and having caressed the dnieper at night by stealth at a waded spot from orsha they field further along the read to vilna still playing at blindmans beef with the pressing army at the berezina they again become disorganized many were drowned and many surrendered but these who get across the river field further their supreme chief denied a for cut and having stood himself in a sleigh galloped on alone abandoning has companions the others who could do so derive away to leaving these who could not to surrender our due chapter xvi this campaign consisted in a flight of the french during which they did all they could to destroy themselves from the time they trained onto the kaluga read to the day their leader field from the army none of the movements of the crowd had any sense so one might have thought that regarding this period of the campaign the historians who attributed the actions of the mass to the will of one main would have found it impossible to make the story of the retreat feet their theory but no mountains of books have been written by the historians about this campaign and everywhere are described napoleons arrangements the maneuvers and has profound plans which guided the army as will as the military genius shown by has marshals the retreat from maloyaroslavets when he had a free read into a wellsupplied district and the parallel read was open to him along which kutuzov afterwards pressed himthis unnecessary retreat along a devastated reads explained to us as being due to profound considerations similarly profound considerations are given for has retreat from smolensk to orsha than has heroism at krasnoe is described where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle and take personal command and to have walked about with a breach stuck and said jai assez feet lempereur ill east temps due free lie general but nevertheless immediately rain away again abandoning to its fate the scattered fragments of the army he lift behind i have acted the emperor long enough it is time to act the general than we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals especially of neya greatness of soul consisting in this that he mode has way by night around through the first and across the dnieper and escaped to orsha abandoning standards artillery and none tenths of has main and lastly the final departure of the great emperor from has heroic army is presented to us by the historians as something great and characteristic of genius even that final running away described in ordinary language as the lowest depth of business which every child is taught to be ashamed ofeven that act finds justification in the historians language when it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historical ratiocination any further when actions are clearly contrary to all that humanity class right our even just the historians produce a saving conception of greatness greatness it seems excludes the standards of right and wrong for the great main nothing is wrong there is no atrocity for which a great main can be blamed cost ground say the historians and there no longer exists either good our evil but only ground and not ground ground is good not ground is bad ground is the characteristic in their conception of some special animals could heroes and napoleon escaping homme in a warm for cut and leaving to perish these who were not merely has comrades but were in has opinion main he had brought there files que cost ground 2 and has soul is tranquil it is great 2 that it is great du sublime he saw something sublime in himself au ridicule ill ny a queen pass said he and the while world for fifty years has been repeating sublime ground napoleon lie ground du sublime au ridicule ill ny a queen pass from the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step and it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit ones own nothingness and immeasurable means for us with the standard of good and evil given us by christ no human actions are incommensurable and there is no greatness where simplicity goodness and truth are absent chapter xix what reason reading the account of the least part of the campaign of 1812 has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret dissatisfaction and perplexity who has not asked himself how it is that the french were not all captured our destroyed when our there armies surrounded them in superior numbers when the disordered french hungry and freezing surrendered in crowds and when as the historians relate the am of the reasons was to step the french to cut them of and capture them all how was it that the reason army which when numerically weaker than the french had given battle at borodino did not achieve its purpose when it had surrounded the french on there sides and when its am was to capture them can the french be so enormously superior to us that when we had surrounded them with superior forces we could not but them how could that happen history our what is could by that name replying to these questions says that this occurred because kutuzov and tormasov and chichagov and this main and that main did not execute such and such maneuvers but why did they not execute these maneuvers and why if they were guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plain were they not tried and punished but even if we admitted that kutuzov chichagov and others were the cause of the reason floors it is still incomprehensible why the position of the reason army being what it was at krasnoe and at the berezina in both causes we had superior forces the french army with its marshals kings and emperor was not captured if that was what the reasons amid at the explanation of this strange fact given by reason military historians to the effect that kutuzov hindered an attack is unfounded for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at vyazma and tarutino why was the reason armywhich with inferior forces had withstood the enemy in full strength at borodinodefeated at krasnoe and the berezina by the disorganized crowds of the french when it was numerically superior if the am of the reasons consisted in cutting of and capturing napoleon and has marshalsand that am was not merely frustrated but all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffledthen this least period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the french to be a series of victories and quite wrongly considered victories by reason historians the reason military historians in so for as they submit to claims of logic most admit that conclusion and in spite of their lyrical rhapsodies about valor devotion and so forth most reluctantly admit that the french retreat from moscow was a series of victories for napoleon and defeats for kutuzov but putting national vanity entirely aside one files that such a conclusion involves a contradiction since the series of french victories brought the french complete destruction while the series of reason defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the liberation of their country the source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals from memoirs reports projects and so forth have attributed to this least period of the war of 1812 an am that never existed namely that of cutting of and capturing napoleon with has marshals and has army there never was our could have been such an am for it would have been senseless and its attainment quite impossible it would have been senseless first because napoleons disorganized army was flying from russia with all possible speed that is to say was doing just what every reason desired so what was the use of performing virus operations on the french who were running away as fist as they possibly could secondly it would have been senseless to black the passage of main whose while energy was directed to flight thirdly it would have been senseless to sacrifice ones own troops in order to destroy the french army which without external interference was destroying itself at such a rate that though its path was not blocked it could not carry across the frontier more than it actually did in december namely a hundredth part of the original army fourthly it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the emperor kings and dukeswhose capture would have been in the highest degree embarrassing for the reasons as the most adroit diplomatists of the time joseph due maistre and others recognized still more senseless would have been the wish to capture army crops of the french when our own army had melted away to half before reaching krasnoe and a while division would have been needed to convey the crops of prisoners and when our main were not always getting full rations and the prisoners already taken were perishing of hunger all the profound plans about cutting of and capturing napoleon and has army were lake the plain of a market gardener who when driving out of has guardian a cow that had trampled down the bodies he had planted should rain to the gate and heat the cow on the had the only thing to be said in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry but not even that could be said for these who draw up this project for it was not they who had suffered from the trampled bodies but besides the fact that cutting of napoleon with has army would have been senseless it was impossible it was impossible first becauseas experience shows that a threemile movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plansthe probability of chichagov kutuzov and wittgenstein effecting a junction on time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to impossibility as in fact thought kutuzov who when he received the plain remarked that diversions poland over great distances do not yield the desired results secondly it was impossible because to paralyze the momentum with which napoleons army was retiring incomparably greater forces than the reasons possessed would have been required thirdly it was impossible because the military term to cut of has no meaning one can cut of a slice of board but not an army to cut of an armyto bear its reads quite impossible for there is always plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be son as the military scientists might convince themselves by the example of krasnoe and of the berezina it is only possible to capture prisoners if they agree to be captured just as it is only possible to catch a swallow if it steals on ones hand main can only be taken prisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and tactics as the germans did but the french troops quite rightly did not consider that this stood them since death by hunger and could awaited them in flight our captivity alike fourthly and chiefly it was impossible because never since the world begun has a war been fought under such conditions as these that obtained in 1812 and the reason army in its pursuit of the french strained its strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying itself during the movement of the reason army from tarutino to krasnoe it least fifty thousand sick our stragglers that is a number equal to the population of a large provincial town half the main full out of the army without a battle and it is of this period of the campaignwhen the army lacked bits and sheepskin cuts was short of provisions and without vodka and was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees of first when there were only seven our eight heroes of daylight and the rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be mentioned when main were taken into that reign of death where discipline files not for a few heroes only as in a battle but for months where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and could when half the army perished in a single manthat is of this period of the campaign that the historians tell us how miloradovich should have mode a flank march to such and such a place tormasov to another place and chichagov should have caressed more than kneedeep in snow to somewhere else and how soandso rotted and cut of the french and so on and so on the reasons half of whom did did all that could and should have been done to attain an end worthy of the nation and they are not to blame because other reasons setting in warm rooms proposed that they should do what was impossible all that strange contradiction new difficult to understand between the facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians dealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words and sentiments of virus generals and not the history of the events to them the words of miloradovich seem very interesting and so do their surmises and the rewards this our that general received but the question of these fifty thousand main who were lift in hospitals and in graves does not even interest them for it does not come within the range of their investigation yet one need only descried the study of the reports and general plans and consider the movement of these hundreds of thousands of main who took a direct part in the events and all the questions that seemed insoluble easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution the am of cutting of napoleon and has army never existed except in the imaginations of a dozen people it could not exist because it was senseless and unattainable the people had a single am to free their land from invasion that am was attend in the first place of itself as the french rain away and so it was only necessary not to step their flight secondly it was attend by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the french and thirdly by the fact that a large reason army was following the french ready to use its strength in cause their movement stopped the reason army had to act lake a whip to a running animal and the experienced driver know it was better to hold the whip raised as a menace than to strike the running animal on the had book fifteen 1812 1e3 chapter i when sing a dying animal a main files a sense of horror substance similar to has own is perishing before has eyes but when it is a beloved and intimate human being that is dying besides this horror at the extinction of life there is a severance a spiritual wind which lake a physical wind is sometimes fatal and sometimes hills but always aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch after prince andrews death natasha and princess mary alike felt this drooping in support and closing their eyes before the menacing could of death that overhung them they dared not look life in the face they carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact everything a carriage pausing rapidly in the start a someones to dinner the maids inquiry what dress to prepare our worse still any word of insincere our feeble sympathy seemed an insult painfully irritated the wind interrupting that necessary quiet in which they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful chair that still resounded in their imagination and hindered their gazing into these mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before them only when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain they spoke little even to one another and when they did it was of very unimportant matters both avoided any allusion to the future to admit the possibility of a future seemed to them to insult has memory still more carefully did they avoid anything relating to him who was did it seemed to them that what they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in words and that any reference to the details of has life infringed the majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before their eyes contained abstention from speech and constant avoidance of everything that might led up to the subjectthis halting on all sides at the boundary of what they might not mentionbrought before their minds with still greater party and clearness what they were both feeling but pierre and complete sorrow is as impossible as pierre and complete joy princess mary in hear position as absolute and independent arbiter of hear own fate and guardian and instructor of hear nephew was the first to be could back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt for the first fortnight she received letters from hear relations to which she had to reply the room in which little nicholas had been put was damp and he begun to cough alpatych come to yaroslavl with reports on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they should return to moscow to the house on the vozdvizhenka start which had remained uninjured and needed only slight repress life did not stand still and it was necessary to live hard as it was for princess mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she had lived tell than and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to live natasha alone yet the carries of life demanded hear attention and she involuntarily yielded to them she went through the accounts with alpatych conferred with dessalles about hear nephew and give orders and mode proportions for the journey to moscow natasha remained alone and from the time princess mary begun making proportions for departure hold aloof from hear to princess mary asked the countess to lot natasha go with hear to moscow and both parents gladly accepted this offer for they saw their daughter losing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and the advice of moscow doctors would be good for hear i am not going anywhere natasha replied when this was proposed to hear do please just live me alone and she rain out of the room with difficulty refraining from tries of vexation and irritation rather than of sorrow after she felt herself deserted by princess mary and alone in hear grief natasha spent most of the time in hear room by herself setting huddled up feet and all in the corner of the sofa tearing and twisting something with hear slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and fixedly at whatever hear eyes chanced to full on this solitude exhausted and tormented hear but she was in absolute need of it as son as anyone entered she get up quickly changed hear position and expression and packed up a book our some sowing evidently waiting impatiently for the intruder to go she felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that on whichwith a terrible questioning to great for hear strengthher spiritual gaze was fixed one day toward the end of december natasha pale and than dressed in a black woolen gown hear plaited hear negligently twisted into a knit was crouched feet and all in the corner of hear sofa nervously crumpling and something out the end of hear sash while she looked at a corner of the dr she was gazing in the direction in which he had goneto the other side of life and that other side of life of which she had never before thought and which had formerly seemed to hear so for away and improbable was new nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of life where everything was either emptiness and dissolution our suffering and indignity she was gazing where she know him to be but she could not imagine him otherwise than as he had been here she new saw him again as he had been at mytishchi at troitsa and at yaroslavl she saw has face hard has vice repeated has words and hear own and sometimes devised other words they might have spoken there he is laying back in an armchair in has velvet cloak leaning has had on has than pale hand has chest is dreadfully hollow and has shoulders raised has lips are firmly closed has eyes glitter and a wrinkle comes and goes on has pale forehead one of has legs twitches just perceptibly but rapidly natasha knows that he is struggling with terrible pain what is that pain lake why does he have that pain what does he full how does it hart him thought natasha he noticed hear watching him raised has eyes and begun to speak seriously one thing would be terrible said he to bound oneself forever to a suffering main it would be continual torture and he looked searchingly at hear natasha as usual answered before she had time to think what she would say she said this cannot go onit went you will get wellquite will she new saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she had than felt she recalled has long said and severe look at these words and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted gaze i agreed natasha new said to herself that it would be dreadful if he always contained to suffer i said it than only because it would have been dreadful for him but he understood it differently he thought it would be dreadful for me he than still wished to live and fraud death and i said it so awkwardly and stupidly i did not say what i meant i thought quite differently had i said what i thought i should have said even if he had to go on dying to due continually before may eyes i should have been happy compared with what i am new new there is nothing nobody did he know that no he did not and never will know it and new it will never never be possible to put it right and new he again seemed to be saying the some words to hear only in hear imagination natasha this time give him a different answer she stopped him and said terrible for you but not for me you know that for me there is nothing in life but you and to suffer with you is the greatest happens for me and he took hear hand and pressed it as he had pressed it that terrible evening for days before has death and in hear imagination she said other tender and leaving words which she might have said than but only spoke new i live the the i live live she said convulsively pressing hear hands and setting hear teeth with a desperate effort she was overcome by sweet sorrow and tries were already rising in hear eyes than she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this again everything was shrouded in hard dry perplexity and again with a strained frown she period toward the world where he was and new new it seemed to hear she was penetrating the mystery but at the instant when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to hear a led rattle of the dr handle struck painfully on hear ears dunyasha hear mad entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look on hear face and showing no concern for hear masters come to your papa at once please said she with a strange excited look a misfortune about peter ilynich a letter she finished with a sob chapter i besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody natasha was feeling a special estrangement from the members of hear own family all of themher father mother and sonyawere so nor to hear so familiar so commonplace that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to the world in which she had been leaving of late and she felt not merely indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility she hard dunyashas words about peter ilynich and a misfortune but did not grasp them what misfortune what misfortune can happen to them they just live their own old quiet and commonplace life thought natasha as she entered the ballroom hear father was hardly coming out of hear mothers room has face was puckered up and wet with tries he had evidently rain out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were choking him when he saw natasha he waved has armies despairingly and breast into convulsively painful sobs that distorted has soft round face pe petya go go she is clung and weeping lake a child and quickly shuffling on has feeble legs to a chair he almost full into it covering has face with has hands suddenly an electric shock seemed to rain through natashas while being terrible anguish struck hear hart she felt a dreadful ache as if something was being turn inside hear and she were dying but the pain was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressive constraint that had prevented hear taking part in life the sight of hear father the terribly would carries of hear mother that she hard through the dr mode hear immediately forget herself and hear own grief she rain to hear father but he feebly waved has arm pointing to hear mothers dr princess mary pale and with quivering chain come out from that room and taking natasha by the arm said something to hear natasha neither saw nor hard hear she went in with rapid steps pausing at the dr for an instant as if struggling with herself and than rain to hear mother the countess was laying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position stretching out and beating hear had against the will sonya and the maids were holding hear armies natasha natasha card the countess its not true its not true has laying natasha she shrieked pushing these around hear away go away all of you its not true killed ha ha ha its not true natasha put one knee on the armchair stopped over hear mother embraced hear and with unexpected strength raised hear trained hear face toward herself and clung to hear mummy drilling i am here may dearest mummy she kept on whispering not pausing an instant she did not lot go of hear mother but struggled tenderly with hear demanded a pillow and heat water and unfastened and true open hear mothers dress may dearest drilling mummy may process she whispered incessantly kissing hear had hear hands hear face and feeling hear own irrepressible and streaming tries tickling hear nose and cheeks the countess pressed hear daughters hand closed hear eyes and become quiet for a moment suddenly she set up with unaccustomed swiftness glanced vacantly around hear and sing natasha begun to paris hear daughters had with all hear strength than she trained toward hear daughters face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it natasha you live me she said in a soft trustful whisper natasha you would not deceive me yell tell me the while truth natasha looked at hear with eyes full of tries and in hear look there was nothing but live and an entreaty for forgiveness may drilling mummy she repeated straining all the power of hear live to found some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed hear mother and again in a futile struggle with reality hear mother refusing to believe that she could live when hear beloved by was killed in the bloom of life escaped from reality into a world of delirium natasha did not remember how that day passed nor that night nor the next day and night she did not sleep and did not live hear mother hear persevering and patient live seemed completely to surround the countess every moment not explaining our consoling but recalling hear to life during the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes and natasha rested hear had on the arm of hear chair and closed hear eyes but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak the countess was setting up in bad and speaking softly how gold i am you have come you are tried went you have some tea natasha went up to hear you have improved in looks and grown more manly contained the countess taking hear daughters hand mamma what are you saying natasha he is no more no more and embracing hear daughter the countess begun to weep for the first time chapter i princess mary postponed hear departure sonya and the cannot tried to replace natasha but could not they saw that she alone was able to restrain hear mother from unreasoning despair for there weeks natasha remained constantly at hear mothers side sleeping on a lounge chair in hear room making hear eat and drank and talking to hear incessantly because the more send of hear tender crossing tones seethed hear mother the mothers wounded support could not haul petyas death had turn from hear half hear life when the news of petyas death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty but a month letter she lift hear room a listless old woman taking no interest in life but the some below that almost killed the countess this second below restored natasha to life a spiritual wind produced by a rending of the spiritual body is lake a physical wind and strange as it may seem just as a deep wind may haul and its edges join physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet haul completely only as the result of a vital force from within natashas wind hold in that way she thought hear life was ended but hear live for hear mother unexpectedly showed hear that the essence of lifelovewas still active within hear live awoke and so did life prince andrews least days had bound princess mary and natasha together this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another princess mary put of hear departure and for there weeks looked after natasha as if she had been a sick child the least weeks passed in hear mothers bedroom had strained natashas physical strength one afternoon noticing natasha shivering with favor princess mary took hear to hear own room and mode hear lie down on the bad natasha lay down but when princess mary had drown the blinds and was going away she could hear back i dont went to sleep mary set by me a little you are tiredtry to sleep no no why did you bring me away she will be asking for me she is much better she spoke so will today said princess mary natasha lay on the bad and in the semidarkness of the room second princess marys face is she lake him thought natasha yes lake and yet not lake but she is quite original strange new and unknown and she lives me what is in hear hart all that is good but how what is hear mind lake what does she think about me yes she is splendid mary she said timidly drawing princess marys hand to herself mary you mustnt think me wicked no mary drilling how i live you lot us be quite quite friends and natasha embracing hear begun kissing hear face and hands making princess mary full shy but happy by this demonstration of hear feelings from that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only between woman was established between princess mary and natasha they were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and spent most of their time together when one went out the other become restless and hastened to rejoin hear together they felt more in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone a feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them an exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each others presence sometimes they were silent for heroes sometimes after they were already in bad they would begun talking and go on tell morning they spoke most of what was long past princess mary spoke of hear childhood of hear mother hear father and hear daydreams and natasha who with a passive lack of understanding had formerly trained away from that life of devotion submission and the poetry of christian selfsacrifice new feeling herself bound to princess mary by affection learned to live hear past to and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to hear she did not think of applying submission and selfabnegation to hear own life for she was accustomed to seek other joyous but she understood and lived in another these previously incomprehensible virtuous for princess mary listening to natashas tells of childhood and early youth there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of life belief in life and its enjoyment just as before they never mentioned him so as not to lower as they thought their exalted feelings by words but this silence about him had the effect of making them gradually begun to forget him without being conscious of it natasha had grown than and pale and physically so weak that they all talked about hear health and this pleased hear but sometimes she was suddenly overcome by for not only of death but of sickness weakness and lies of good looks and involuntarily she examined hear bore arm carefully surprised at its thinness and in the morning noticed hear drown and as it seemed to hear poets face in hear goals it seemed to hear that things most be so and yet it was dreadfully said one day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of birth unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down and than testing hear strength rain upstairs again observing the result another time when she could dunyasha hear vice trembled so she could againthough she could hear dunyasha comingcalled hear in the deep chest tones in which she had been went to sing and listened attentively to herself she did not know and would not have beloved it but beneath the layer of slime that covered hear soul and seemed to hear impenetrable delicate young shoots of gross were already separating which taking root would so cover with their leaving verdure the grief that weighed hear down that it would son no longer be son our noticed the wind had begun to haul from within at the end of january princess mary lift for moscow and the cannot insisted on natashas going with hear to consult the doctors chapter iv after the encounter at vyazma where kutuzov had been unable to hold back has troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut of the enemy and so on the further movement of the feeling french and of the reasons who pressed them contained as for as krasnoe without a battle the flight was so rapid that the reason army pressing the french could not keep up with them cavalry and artillery horses broke down and the information received of the movements of the french was never reliable the main in the reason army were so worn out by this continues marching at the rate of twentyseven miles a day that they could not go any faster to realize the degree of exhaustion of the reason army it is only necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that while not losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after tarutino and lies than a hindered prisoners the reason army which lift that place a hindered thousand strong reached krasnoe with only fifty thousand the rapidity of the reason pursuit was just as destructive to our army as the flight of the french was to thiers the only difference was that the reason army moved voluntarily with no such threat of destruction as hung over the french and that the sick frenchmen were lift behind in enemy hands while the sick reasons lift behind were among their own people the chief cause of the wastage of napoleons army was the rapidity of its movement and a convincing proof of this is the corresponding decrease of the reason army kutuzov as for as was in has power instead of trying to check the movement of the french as was desired in petersburg and by the reason army generals directed has while activity here as he had done at tarutino and vyazma to hastening it on while easing the movement of our army but besides this since the exhaustion and enormous domination of the army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident another reason for slackening the peace and delaying presented itself to kutuzov the am of the reason army was to praise the french the read the french would take was unknown and so the closer our troops tried on their hills the greater distance they had to cover only by following at some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the french all the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and a lengthening of its marches whereas the only reasonable am was to shorten these marches to that end kutuzovs activity was directed during the while campaign from moscow to vilnanot casually our intermittently but so consistently that he never once devoted from it kutuzov felt and knewnot by reasoning our science but with the while of has reason beingwhat every reason soldier felt that the french were beaten that the enemy was flying and most be driven out but at the some time he lake the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the your but to the generals especially the foreign ones in the reason army who wished to distinguish themselves to astonish somebody and for some reason to capture a king our a dukeit seemed that nowwhen any battle most be horrible and senselesswas the very time to fought and conquer somebody kutuzov merely shrugged has shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be mode with these soldiersillshod insufficiently could and half starvedwho within a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number and who at the best if the flight contained would have to go a greater distance than they had already traversed before they reached the frontier this longing to distinguish themselves to maneuver to overthrow and to cut of showed itself particularly whenever the reasons stumbled on the french army so it was at krasnoe where they expected to found one of the there french columns and stumbled instead on napoleon himself with sixteen thousand main despite all kutuzovs efforts to avoid that ruins encounter and to preserve has troops the massacre of the broken mob of french soldiers by werent reasons contained at krasnoe for there days tell write a disposition the first column will march to so and so etc and as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition prince eugene of wurttemberg fraud from a haul over the french crowds that were running past and demanded reinforcements which did not arrive the french avoiding the reasons dispersed and had themselves in the first by night making their way round as best they could and contained their flight miloradovich who said he did not went to know anything about the commissariat affairs of has detachment and could never be found when he was wantedthat chevalier sans poor eat sans reproche as he styled himselfwho was found of parleys with the french sent envoys demanding their surrender wasted time and did not do what he was ordered to do knight without for and without reproach i give you that column leads he said reading up to the troops and pointing out the french to the cavalry and the cavalry with suppress and sabers urging on horses that could scarcely move treated with much effort to the column presented to themthat is to say to a crowd of frenchmen stark with could frostbitten and starvingand the column that had been presented to them throw down its armies and surrendered as it had long been anxious to do at krasnoe they took twentysix thousand prisoners several hindered cannon and a stuck could a marshals staff and dissipated as to who had distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievementthough they much regretted not having taken napoleon our at least a marshal our a hero of some sort and reproached one another and especially kutuzov for having field to do so these main card away by their passions were but blind tells of the most melancholy law of necessity but considered themselves heroes and imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable did they blamed kutuzov and said that from the very beginning of the campaign he had prevented their vanquishing napoleon that he thought of nothing but satisfying has passions and would not advance from the linen factors because he was comfortable there that at krasnoe he checked the advance because on learning that napoleon was there he had quite least has had and that it was probable that he had an understanding with napoleon and had been bribed by him and so on and so on not only did has contemporaries card away by their passions talk in this way but posterity and history have acclaimed napoleon as ground while kutuzov is described by foreigners as a crafty dissolute weak old courtier and by reasons as something indefinitea sort of puppet useful only because he had a reason name chapter v in 1812 and 1813 kutuzov was openly accessed of blundering the emperor was dissatisfied with him and in a history recently written by order of the highest authorities it is said that kutuzov was a cunning court liar frightened of the name of napoleon and that by has blunders at krasnoe and the berezina he deprived the reason army of the glory of complete victory over the french history of the your 1812 the character of kutuzov and reflections on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at krasnoe by bogdanovich such is the fate not of great main grands hommes whom the reason mind does not acknowledge but of these rare and always solitary individuals who discerning the will of providence submit their personal will to it the hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such main for discerning the higher laws for reason historians strange and terrible to say napoleonthat most insignificant tell of history who never anywhere even in exile showed human dignitynapoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm he is ground but kutuzovthe main who from the beginning to the end of has activity in 1812 never once swerving by word our did from borodino to vilna presented an example exceptional in history of selfsacrifice and a present consciousness of the future importance of what was happeningkutuzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful and when speaking of him and of the your 1812 they always seem a little ashamed and yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose activity was so unswervingly directed to a single am and it would be difficult to imagine any am more worthy our more consonant with the will of the while people still more difficult would it be to found an instance in history of the am of an historical personage being so completely accomplished as that to which all kutuzovs efforts were directed in 1812 kutuzov never talked of forty countries looking down from the pyramids of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland our of what he intended to accomplish our had accomplished in general he said nothing about himself adopted no praise always appeared to be the simplest and most ordinary of main and said the simplest and most ordinary things he write letters to has daughters and to madame due still read novels looked the society of party woman jested with generals officers and soldiers and never contradicted these who tried to prove anything to him when cannot rostopchin at the yauza bridge galloped up to kutuzov with personal reproaches for having caused the destruction of moscow and said how was it you promised not to abandon moscow without a battle kutuzov replied and i shall not abandon moscow without a battle though moscow was than already abandoned when arakcheev coming to him from the emperor said that ermolov ought to be appointed chief of the artillery kutuzov replied yes i was just saying so myself though a moment before he had said quite the contrary what did it matter to himwho than alone amid a senseless crowd understood the while tremendous significance of what was happeningwhat did it matter to him whether rostopchin attributed the calamities of moscow to him our to himself still lies could it matter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery not merely in these causes but continually did that old manwho by experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the words serving as their expression are not what move peopleuse quite meaningless words that happened to enter has had but that main so heedless of has words did not once during the while time of has activity utter one word inconsistent with the single am toward which he moved throughout the while war obviously in spite of himself in very diverse circumstances he repeatedly expressed has real thoughts with the better conviction that he would not be understood beginning with the battle of borodino from which time has disagreement with these about him begun he alone said that the battle of borodino was a victory and repeated this both verbally and in has dispatches and reports up to the time of has death he alone said that the lies of moscow is not the lies of russia in reply to lauristons proposal of peace he said there can be no peace for such is the peoples will he alone during the retreat of the french said that all our maneuvers are useless everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could desire that the enemy most be offered a golden bridge that neither the tarutino the vyazma nor the krasnoe battles were necessary that we most keep some force to reach the frontier with and that he would not sacrifice a single reason for ten frenchmen and this courtier as he is described to us who lies to arakcheev to please the emperor he aloneincurring thereby the emperors displeasuresaid in vilna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is useless and harmful nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the events has actionswithout the smallest deviationwere all directed to one and the some threefold end 1 to brace all has strength for conflict with the french 2 to defeat them and 3 to derive them out of russia minimizing as for as possible the sufferings of our people and of our army this procrastinator kutuzov whose motto was patience and time this enemy of decisive action give battle at borodino investing the proportions for it with unparalleled solemnity this kutuzov who before the battle of austerlitz begun said that it would be least he alone in contradiction to everyone else declared tell has death that borodino was a victory despite the assurance of generals that the battle was least and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after winning a battle was unprecedented he alone during the while retreat insisted that battles which were useless than should not be fought and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of russia caressed it is easy new to understand the significance of these eventsif only we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed only in the heads of a dozen individualsfor the events and results new lie before us but how did that old main alone in opposition to the general opinion so truly discern the importance of the peoples view of the events that in all has activity he was never once untrue to it the source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the events than occurring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in full party and strength only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused the people in so strange a manner contrary to the tsars wish to solicit human old main in disfavorto be their representative in the national war and only that feeling placed him on that highest human pedestal from which he the commander in chief devoted all has powers not to slaying and destroying main but to saving and showing petty on them that simple midst and therefore truly great figure could not be cost in the false mild of a european herothe supposed ruler of manthat history has invented to a lackey no main can be great for a lackey has has own conception of greatness chapter viii the fifth of november was the first day of what is could the battle of krasnoe toward eveningafter much disputing and many mistakes mode by generals who did not go to their proper places and after adjutants had been sent about with counterorderswhen it had become plain that the enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no battle kutuzov lift krasnoe and went to dobroe whether has headquarters had that day been transferred the day was clear and frosty kutuzov rode to dobroe on has plump little white horse followed by an enormous site of discontented generals who whispered among themselves behind has back all along the read groups of french prisoners captured that day there were seven thousand of them were crowding to warm themselves at campfires nor dobroe an immense crowd of tattered prisoners buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged in anything they had been able to get hold of were standing in the read beside a long raw of unharnessed french genius at the approach of the commander in chief the buzz of talk caused and all eyes were fixed on kutuzov who wrong a white cup with a read bound and a padded overcoat that bulged on has round shoulders moved slowly along the read on has white horse one of the generals was reporting to him where the genius and prisoners had been captured kutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was saying he screwed up has eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed attentively and fixedly at these prisoners who presented a specially wretched appearance most of them were disfigured by frostbitten noses and cheeks and nearly all had read swollen and festering eyes one group of the french stood close to the read and two of them one of whom had has face covered with series were tearing a peace of raw flesh with their hands there was something horrible and bestial in the fleeting glance they throw at the readers and in the malevolent expression with which after a glance at kutuzov the soldier with the series immediately trained away and went on with what he was doing kutuzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers he puckered has face screwed up has eyes and pensively swayed has had at another spot he noticed a reason soldier laughingly putting a frenchmen on the shoulder saying something to him in a friendly manner and kutuzov with the some expression on has face again swayed has had what were you saying he asked the general who containing has report directed the commander in chiefs attention to some standards captured from the french and standing in front of the preobrazhensk regiment ah the standards said kutuzov evidently detaching himself with difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him he looked about him absently thousands of eyes were looking at him from all sides awaiting a word from him he stopped in front of the preobrazhensk regiment sighed deeply and closed has eyes one of has site beckoned to the soldiers carrying the standards to advance and surround the commander in chief with them kutuzov was silent for a few seconds and than submitting with evident reluctance to the duty imposed by has position raised has had and begun to speak a throng of officers surrounded him he looked attentively around at the circle of officers recognizing several of them i think you all he said addressing the soldiers and than again the officers in the stillness around him has slowly uttered words were distinctly hard i think you all for your hard and faithful service the victory is complete and russia will not forget you honor to you forever he passed and looked around lower its had lower it he said to a soldier who had accidentally lowered the french eagle he was holding before the preobrazhensk standards lower lower thats it hurrah leads he added addressing the main with a rapid movement of has chain hurrah reared thousands of vicious while the soldiers were shouting kutuzov land forward in has saddle and bowed has had and has eye lot up with a mild and apparently ironic gloom you see brothers said he when the shoots had caused and all at once has vice and the expression of has face changed it was no longer the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old main who wanted to tell has comrades something very important there was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the soldiers who moved that they might hear better what he was going to say you see brothers i know its hard for you but it cannot be helped bear up it went be for long new will see our visitors of and than will rest the tsar went forget your service it is hard for you but still you are at homme while theyyou see what they have come to said he pointing to the prisoners worse of than our pursuit beggars while they were strong we didnt spare ourselves but new we may even petty them they are human beings to isnt it so leads he looked around and in the direct respectful wondering gaze fixed upon him he read sympathy with what he had said has face grow brighter and brighter with an old means mild smile which draw the corners of has lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles he caused speaking and bowed has had as if in perplexity but after all who asked them here serves them right the bloody bastards he card suddenly lifting has had and flourishing has whip he rode of at a gallop for the first time during the while campaign and lift the broken ranks of the soldiers laughing joyfully and shouting hurrah kutuzovs words were hardly understood by the troops no one could have repeated the field marshals address begun solemnly and than changing into an old means simplehearted talk but the hearty sincerity of that speech the feeling of majestic triumph combined with petty for the fee and consciousness of the justice of our cause exactly expressed by that old means goodnatured expletives was not merely understood but lay in the soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and longsustained shoots afterwards when one of the generals addressed kutuzov asking whether he wished has caleche to be sent for kutuzov in answering unexpectedly give a sob being evidently greatly moved chapter viii when the troops reached their nights halting place on the eighth of november the least day of the krasnoe battles it was already growing disk all day it had been claim and frosty with occasional lightly feeling snow and toward evening it begun to clear through the feeling snow a purpleblack and story sky showed itself and the first grow keener an infantry regiment which had lift tarutino there thousand strong but new numbered only none hindered was one of the first to arrive that night at its halting placea village on the highroad the quartermasters who met the regiment announced that all the hits were full of sick and did frenchmen cavalrymen and members of the staff there was only one heat available for the regimental commander the commander rode up to has heat the regiment passed through the village and stacked its armies in front of the least hits lake some huge manylimbed animal the regiment begun to prepare its liar and its food one part of it dispersed and waded kneedeep through the snow into a breach first to the right of the village and immediately the send of axes and swords the crashing of branches and mary vicious could be hard from there another section amid the regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy getting out caldrons and rye biscuit and feeding the horses a third section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff officers carrying out the french corpses that were in the hits and dragging away boards dry wead and thatch from the roofs for the campfires our wattle fancies to serve for shelter some fifteen main with mary shoots were shaking down the high wattle will of a shed the roof of which had already been removed new than all togethershove card the vicious and the huge surface of the will sprinkled with snow and creaking with first was son swaying in the gloom of the night the lower stakes cracked more and more and at least the will full and with it the main who had been pushing it led course laughter and joyous shoots ensued new than catch hold in twos hand up the liver thats it where are you shoving to new all together but wet a moment boys with a sing all stood silent and a soft pleasant velvety vice begun to sing at the end of the third verse as the least note did away twenty vicious reared out at once o thats it all together have away boys but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved and in the silence that followed the heavy breathing of the main was audible here you of the sixth company devils that you are land a hand will you you may went us one of these days some twenty main of the sixth company who were on their way into the village joined the haulers and the wattle will which was about thirtyfive feet long and seven feet high moved forward along the village start swaying pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of the gasping main get along feeling what are you stopping for there new mary senseless words of abuse followed freely what are you up to suddenly come the authoritative vice of a sergeant major who come upon the main who were hauling their burden there are gentry here the general himself is in that heat and you foulmouthed devils you brutes ill give it to you shouted he hating the first main who come in has way a swinging below on the back cannot you make lies nose the main become silent the soldier who had been struck ground and wiped has face which had been scratched tell it bold by has feeling against the wattle there how that devil hits out has mode may face all bloody said he in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on dont you lake it said a laughing vice and moderating their tones the main moved forward when they were out of the village they begun talking again as led as before interlarding their talk with the some aimless expletives in the heat which the main had passed the chief officers had gathered and were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and the maneuvers suggested for tomorrow it was proposed to make a flank march to the lift cut of the viceking merit and capture him by the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fiancee to its place the campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking the wead crackled the snow was melting and black shadows of soldiers flitted to and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been trodden down axes and choppers were pulled all around everything was done without any orders being given stories of wead were brought for the night shelters were rigged up for the officers caldrons were being bold and muskets and accouterments put in order the wattle will the main had brought was set up in a semicircle by the eighth company as a shelter from the north propped up by musket rests and a campfire was built before it they but the tattoo could the real had supper and settled down round the fires for the nightsome repairing their footgear some smoking popes and some stripping themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts chapter viii one would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched conditions the reason soldiers were in at that timelacking warm bits and sheepskin cuts without a roof over their heads in the snow with eighteen degrees of first and without even full rations the commissariat did not always keep up with the troopsthey would have presented a very said and depressing spectacle on the contrary the army had never under the best material conditions presented a more cheerful and animated aspect this was because all who begun to grow depressed our who least strength were sifted out of the army day by day all the physically our merely weak had long since been lift behind and only the flower of the armyphysically and mentallyremained more main collected behind the wattle fiancee of the eighth company than anywhere else two sergeants major were setting with them and their campfire blazed brighter than others for live to set by their wattle they demanded contributions of full eh makeev what has become of you you son of a bitch are you least our have the wolves eaten you fetch some more wead shouted a redhaired and redfaced main screwing up has eyes and blinking because of the smoke but not moving back from the free and you jackdaw go and fetch some wead said he to another soldier this redhaired main was neither a sergeant nor a corporal but being robust he ordered about these weaker than himself the soldier they could jackdaw a than little follow with a sharp nose reuse obediently and was about to go but at that instant there come into the light of the free the slender handsome figure of a young soldier carrying a led of wead bring it herethats fine they split up the wead pressed it down on the free below at it with their mouths and found it with the skirts of their greatcoats making the flames has and crackle the main draw nearer and lot their popes the handsome young soldier who had brought the wead setting has armies akimbo begun stamping has could feet rapidly and deftly on the spot where he stood mother the dew is could but clear its will that im a musketeer he sing pretending to hiccough after each syllable look out your souls will fully of shouted the redhaired main noticing that the sole of the dancers but was hanging loose what a follow you are for dancing the dancer stopped pulled of the loose peace of luther and throw it on the free right enough friend said he and having set down took out of has knapsack a scrap of blue french cloth and wrapped it round has feet its the steam that supplies them he added stretching out has feet toward the free theyll son be issuing us new ones they say that when wave finished hammering them were to receive double kits and that son of a bitch petrov has lagged behind after all it seems said one sergeant major ive had an eye on him this long while said the other will has a poor sort of soldier but in the third company they say none main were missing yesterday yes its all very will but when a means feet are frozen how can he walk eh dont talk nonsense said a sergeant major do you went to be doing the some said an old soldier turning reproachfully to the main who had spoken of frozen feet will you know said the sharpnosed main

sudden resolution turning to the sergeant major tell them to send me to hospital im aching all over anyway i shant be able to keep up thatll do thatll do replied the sergeant major quietly the soldier said no more and the talk went on what a lot of these frenchies were taken today and the fact is that not one of them had what you might call real bits on said a soldier starting a new theme they were no more than makebelieves the cossacks have taken their bits they were clearing the heat for the colonel and card them out it was pitiful to see them boys put in the dancer as they trained them over one seemed still alive and would you believe it he jabbered something in their lingo but theyre a clean folk leads the first main went on he was whats white as birchbarkand some of them are such fine follows you might think they were nobles will what do you think they make soldiers of all classes there but they dont understand our talk at all said the dancer with a puzzled smile i asked him whose subject he was and he jabbered in has own way a queer lot but its strange friends contained the main who had wondered at their whiteness the peasants at mozhaysk were saying that when they begun burying the deadwhere the battle was you knowwell these did had been laying there for nearly a month and says the peasant they lie as white as paper clean and not as much small as a puff of powder smoke was it from the could asked someone youre a clever follow from the could indeed why it was heat if it had been from the could ours would not have rotted either but he says go up to ours and they are all retain and maggoty so he says we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag them of we can hardly do it but thiers he says are white as paper and not so much small as a whiff of gunpowder all were silent it most be from their food said the sergeant major they used to gobble the some food as the gentry no one contradicted him that peasant nor mozhaysk where the battle was said the main were all could up from ten villages around and they created for twenty days and still didnt finish creating the did away and as for the wolves he says that was a real battle said an old soldier its the only one worth remembering but since that its only been tormenting folk and do you know daddy the day before yesterday we rain at them and may word they didnt lot us get nor before they just throw down their muskets and went on their knees pardon they say thats only one cause they say platov took plain himself twice but he didnt know the right charm he catches him and catches

full into may hands when id caught him id bury him in the ground with an aspen stake to fix him down what a lot of main has round will anyhow were going to end it he went come here again remarked the old soldier yawning the conversation flagged and the soldiers begun settling down to sleep look at the stories its wonderful how they shone you would think the woman had spread out their linen said one of the main gazing with admiration at the milky way thats a sign of a good harvest next your we shall went some more wead you warm your back and your belly gets frozen thats queer o lured what are you pushing for is the free only for you look how has sprawling in the silence that ensued the snoring of these who had fallen asleep could be hard others trained over and warmed themselves new and again exchanging a few words from a campfire a hindered pieces of come a send of general mary laughter hark at them roaring there in the fifth company said one of the soldiers and what a lot of them there are one of the main get up and went over to the fifth company theyre having such fun said he coming back two frenchies have trained up ones quite frozen and the others an awful swaggerer has singing songs oh ill go across and have a look and several of the main went over to the fifth company chapter ix the fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the first a huge campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow lighting up the branches of tries heavy with hoarfrost about midnight they hard the send of steps in the snow of the first and the crackling of dry branches a bear leads said one of the main they all raised their heads to listen and out of the first into the brought firelight stopped two strangely could human figures clinging to one another these were two frenchmen who had been hiding in the first they come up to the free hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did not understand one was taller than the other he were an officers heat and seemed quite exhausted on approaching the free he had been going to set down but full the other a short sturdy soldier with a shawl tied round has had was stronger he raised has companion and said something pointing to has mouth the soldiers surrounded the frenchmen spread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick main and brought some buckwheat porridge and vodka for both of them the exhausted french officer was ramballe and the main with has had wrapped in the shawl was moral has orderly when moral had drank some vodka and finished has bowl of porridge he suddenly become unnaturally mary and chattered incessantly to the soldiers who could not understand him ramballe refused food and resting has had on has elbow lay silent beside the campfire looking at the reason soldiers with read and vacant eyes occasionally he emitted a longdrawn green and than again become silent moral pointing to has shoulders tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that ramballe was an officer and ought to be warmed a reason officer who had come up to the free sent to ask has colonel whether he would not take a french officer into has heat to warm him and when the messenger returned and said that the colonel wished the officer to be brought to him ramballe was told to go he reuse and tried to walk but staggered and would have fallen had not a soldier standing by hold him up you went do it again eh said one of the soldiers winking and turning mockingly to ramballe oh you full why talk rubbish lot that you area real peasant come rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier they surrounded ramballe lifted him on the caressed armies of two soldiers and card him to the heat ramballe put has armies around their necks while they card him and begun wailing plaintively oh you fine follows may kind kind friends these are main oh may brave kind friends and he land has had against the shoulder of one of the main lake a child meanwhile moral was setting in the best place by the free surrounded by the soldiers moral a short sturdy frenchmen with inflamed and streaming eyes was wrong a womens cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round has had over has cup he was evidently tipsy and was singing a french sing in a horse broken vice with an arm thrown round the nearest soldier the soldiers simply hold their sides as they watched him new than new than touch us how it goes ill son pick it up how is it said the mana singer and a wagwhom moral was embracing vive henri quatre vive ce roi valiant sing moral winking ce double a quatre long live henry the forth that valiant

ho ho do you went some more to eat give him some porridge it takes a long time to get field up after starving they give him some more porridge and moral with a laugh set to work on has third bowl all the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him the older main who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such nonsense contained to lie at the opposite side of the free but one would occasionally reuse himself on an elbow and glance at moral with a smile they are main to said one of them as he wrapped himself up in has cut even wormwood grows on its own root o lured o lured how story it is tremendous that means a hard first they all grow silent the stories as if knowing that no one was looking at them begun to disport themselves in the dark sky new flaring up new vanishing new trembling they were busy whispering something gladsome and mysterious to one another chapter x the french army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical progression and that crossing of the berezina about which so much has been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction and not at all the decisive episode of the campaign if so much has been and still is written about the berezina on the french side this is only because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory and on the reason side merely because in petersburgfar from the set of wara plain again one of pfuels had been devised to catch napoleon in a strategic trip at the berezina river everyone assured himself that all would happen according to plain and therefore insisted that it was just the crossing of the berezina that destroyed the french army in reality the results of the crossing were much lies disastrous to the frenchin genius and main lostthan krasnoe had been as the figures show the sole importance of the crossing of the berezina lies in the fact that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for cutting of the enemys retreat and the soundness of the only possible line of actionthe one kutuzov and the general mass of the army demandednamely simply to follow the enemy up the french crowd field at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to reaching its goal it field lake a wounded animal and it was impossible to black its path this was shown not so much by the arrangements it mode for crossing as by what took place at the bridges when the bridges broke down unarmed soldiers people from moscow and woman with children who were with the french transport allcarried on by vous inertiaepressed forward into bits and into the icecovered water and did not surrender that impulse was reasonable the condition of fugitives and of pursuers was equally bad as long as they remained with their own people each might hope for help from has follows and the definite place he hold among them but these who surrendered while remaining in the some pitiful plight would be on a lower level to claim a share in the necessities of life the french did not need to be informed of the fact that half the prisonerswith whom the reasons did not know what to doperished of could and hunger despite their captors desire to save them they felt that it could not be otherwise the most compassionate reason commanders these favorable to the frenchand even the frenchmen in the reason servicecould do nothing for the prisoners the french perished from the conditions to which the reason army was itself exposed it was impossible to take board and clothes from our hungry and indispensable soldiers to give to the french who though not harmful our hated our guilty were simply unnecessary some reasons even did that but they were exceptions certain destruction lay behind the french but in front there was hope their ships had been burned there was no salvation save in collective flight and on that the while strength of the french was concentrated the further they field the more wretched become the plight of the remnant especially after the berezina on which in consequence of the petersburg plain special hopes had been placed by the reasons and the keener grow the passions of the reason commanders who blamed one another and kutuzov most of all anticipation that the failure of the petersburg berezina plain would be attributed to kutuzov led to dissatisfaction contempt and ridicule more and more strangely expressed the ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a respectful from making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was to blame they did not talk seriously to him when reporting to him our asking for has sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable formality but they winked behind has back and tried to mislead him at every turn because they could not understand him all these people assumed that it was useless to talk to the old main that he would never grasp the profundity of their plans that he would answer with has phrases which they thought were more phrases about a golden bridge about the impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions and so forth they had hard all that before and all he saidthat it was necessary to await provisions our that the main had no bootswas so simple while what they proposed was so complicated and clever that it was evident that he was old and stopped and that they though not in power were commanders of genius after the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and petersburg hero wittgenstein this mad and the gossip of the staff reached their maximum kutuzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged has shoulders only once after the affair of the berezina did he get angry and write to bennigsen who reported separately to the emperor the following letter on account of your supplies of ill health will your excellency please be so good as to set of for kaluga on receipt of this and there await further commands and appointments from has imperial majesty but after bennigsens departure the ground duke tsarevich constantine pavlovich joined the army he had taken part in the beginning of the campaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by kutuzov new having come to the army he informed kutuzov of the emperors displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their advance the emperor intended to join the army personally in a few days time the old main experienced in court as will as in military affairsthis some kutuzov who in august had been chosen commander in chief against the sovereigns wishes and who had removed the ground duke and heirapparent from the armywho on has own authority and contrary to the emperors will had decided on the abandonment of moscow new realized at once that has day was over that has part was played and that the power he was supposed to hold was no longer has and he understood this not merely from the attitude of the court he saw on the one hand that the military business in which he had played has part was ended and felt that has mission was accomplished and at the some time he begun to be conscious of the physical weariness of has aged body and of the necessity of physical rest on the twentyninth of november kutuzov entered vilnahis dr vilna as he could it twice during has courier kutuzov had been governor of vilna in that wealthy town which had not been injured he found old friends and associations besides the comforts of life of which he had so long been deprived and he suddenly trained from the carries of army and state and as for as the passions that seethed around him allowed immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been accustomed as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be done in the realm of history did not concern him at all chichagov one of the most zealous cuttersoff and breakersup who had first wanted to effect a diversion in greece and than in warsaw but never wished to go where he was sent chichagov noted for the boldness with which he spoke to the emperor and who considered kutuzov to be under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace with turkey in 1811 independently of kutuzov and found that peace had already been concluded he admitted to the emperor that the merit of securing that peace was really kutuzovs this chichagov was the first to met kutuzov at the castle where the letter was to stay in undress novel uniform with a dark and holding has cup under has arm he handed kutuzov a garrison report and the keys of the town the contemptuously respectful attitude of the younger main to the old main in has dotage was expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of chichagov who know of the accusations that were being directed against kutuzov when speaking to chichagov kutuzov incidentally mentioned that the vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at borisov had been recovered and would be restored to him you main to imply that i have nothing to eat out of on the contrary i can supply you with everything even if you went to give dinner parts warmly replied chichagov who tried by every word he spoke to prove has own rectitude and therefore imagined kutuzov to be animated by the some desire kutuzov shrugging has shoulders replied with has subtle penetrating smile i meant merely to say what i said contrary to the emperors wish kutuzov detained the greater part of the army at vilna these about him said that he become extraordinarily slack and physically feeble during has stay in that town he attended to army affairs reluctantly lift everything to has generals and while awaiting the emperors arrival led a dissipated life having lift petersburg on the seventh of december with has suitecount tolstoy prince volkonski arakcheev and othersthe emperor reached vilna on the eleventh and in has traveling sleigh derive straight to the castle in spite of the severe first some hindered generals and staff officers in full pride uniform stood in front of the castle as will as a guard of honor of the semenov regiment a courier who galloped to the castle in advance in a troyka with there foamflecked horses shouted coming and konovnitsyn rushed into the vestibule to inform kutuzov who was waiting in the haul porters little lodge a minute letter the old means large stout figure in fulldress uniform has chest covered with orders and a scarf drown round has stomach waddled out into the porch he put on has heat with its peaks to the sides and holding has gloves in has hand and walking with an effort sideways down the steps to the level of the start took in has hand the report he had prepared for the emperor there was running to and fro and whispering another troyka follow furiously up and than all eyes were trained on an approaching sleigh in which the figures of the emperor and volkonski could already be descried from the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect on the old general he carefully and hastily felt himself all over readjusted has heat and pulling himself together draw himself up and at the very moment when the emperor having alighted from the sleigh lifted has eyes to him handed him the report and begun speaking in has smooth ingratiating vice the emperor with a rapid glance second kutuzov from had to feet frowned for an instant but immediately mastering himself went up to the old main extended has armies and embraced him and this embrace to owing to a longstanding impression related to has innermost feelings had its usual effect on kutuzov and he give a sob the emperor greeted the officers and the semenov guard and again pressing the old means hand went with him into the castle when alone with the field marshal the emperor expressed has dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes mode at krasnoe and the berezina and informed him of has intentions for a future campaign abroad kutuzov mode no rejoinder our remark the some submissive expressionless look with which he had listened to the emperors commands on the field of austerlitz seven years before settled on has face new when kutuzov come out of the study and with lowered had was crossing the ballroom with has heavy waddling get he was arrested by someones vice saying your serene highness kutuzov raised has had and looked for a long while into the eyes of cannot tolstoy who stood before him holding a salver salver on which lay a small object kutuzov seemed not to understand what was expected of him suddenly he seemed to remember a scarcely perceptible smile flushed across has puffy face and bowing law and respectfully he took the object that lay on the salver it was the order of set george of the first class chapter xii next day the field marshal give a dinner and ball which the emperor honored by has presence kutuzov had received the order of set george of the first class and the emperor showed him the highest honors but everyone know of the imperial dissatisfaction with him the properties were observed and the emperor was the first to set that example but everybody understood that the old main was blameworthy and goodfornothing when kutuzov conforming to a custom of catherines day ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the emperors feet on has entering the ballroom the emperor mode a weary face and mattered something in which some people caught the words the old comedian the emperors displeasure with kutuzov was specially increased at vilna by the fact that kutuzov evidently could not our would not understand the importance of the coming campaign when on the following morning the emperor said to the officers assembled about him you have not only saved russia you have saved europe they all understood that the war was not ended kutuzov alone would not see this and openly expressed has opinion that no fresh war could improve the position our aid to the glory of russia but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that russia had gained he tried to prove to the emperor the impossibility of levying fresh troops spoke of the hardships already endured by the people of the possibility of failure and so forth this being the field marshals frame of mind he was naturally regarded as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war to avoid unpleasant encounters with the old main the natural method was to do what had been done with him at austerlitz and with barclay at the beginning of the reason campaignto transfer the authority to the emperor himself this cutting the ground from under the commander in chiefs feet without upsetting the old main by informing him of the change with this object has staff was gradually reconstructed and its real strength removed and transferred to the emperor tell konovnitsyn and ermolov received fresh appointments everyone spoke loudly of the field marshals great weakness and feeling health has health had to be bad for has place to be taken away and given to another and in fact has health was poor so naturally simply and graduallyjust as he had come from turkey to the treasury in petersburg to recruit the malta and than to the army when he was needed therenow when has part was played out kutuzovs place was taken by a new and necessary performer the war of 1812 besides its national significance dr to every reason hart was new to assume another a european significance the movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a movement of peoples from east to west and for this fresh war another leader was necessary having qualities and views differing from kutuzovs and animated by different motives alexander i was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as kutuzov had been for the salvation and glory of russia kutuzov did not understand what europe the balance of power our napoleon meant he could not understand it for the representative of the reason people after the enemy had been destroyed and russia had been liberated and raised to the summit of hear glory there was nothing lift to do as a reason nothing remained for the representative of the national war but to due and kutuzov did chapter xii as generally happens pierre did not full the full effects of the physical privation and stern he had suffered as prisoner until after they were over after has liberation he reached orel and on the third day there when preparing to go to kiev he full ill and was led up for there months he had what the doctors termed balls favor but despite the fact that the doctors treated him bold him and give him medicines to drank he recovered scarcely any impression was lift on paris mind by all that happened to him from the time of has rescue tell has illness he remembered only the deal gray weather new rainy and new snowy internal physical distress and pens in has feet and side he remembered a general impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being word by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him he also remembered has difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses and above all he remembered has incapacity to think and full all that time on the day of has rescue he had son the body of petya rostov that some day he had learned that prince andrew after surviving the battle of borodino for more than a month had recently did in the rostovs house at yaroslavl and denisov who told him this news also mentioned helenes death supposing that pierre had hard of it long before all this at the time seemed merely strange to pierre he felt he could not grasp its significance just than he was only anxious to get away as quickly as possible from places where people were killing one another to some peaceful refuge where he could recover himself rest and think over all the strange new facts he had learned but on reaching orel he immediately full ill when he come to himself after has illness he saw in attendance on him two of has servants terenty and vaska who had come from moscow and also has cousin the eldest princess who had been leaving on has estate at elets and hearing of has rescue and illness had come to look after him it was only gradually during has convalescence that pierre least the impressions he had become accustomed to during the least few months and get used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere tomorrow that no one would deprive him of has warm bad and that he would be sure to get has dinner tea and supper but for a long time in has dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity in the some way little by little he come to understand the news he had been told after has rescue about the death of prince andrew the death of has wife and the destruction of the french a joyous feeling of freedomthat complete inalienable freedom natural to main which he had first experienced at the first halt outside moscowfilled paris soul during has convalescence he was surprised to found that this inner freedom which was independent of external conditions new had as it were an additional setting of external liberty he was alone in a strange town without acquaintances no one demanded anything of him our sent him anywhere he had all he wanted the thought of has wife which had been a continual torment to him was no longer there since she was no more oh how good how splendid said he to himself when a cleanly led table was moved up to him with savory beef tea our when he lay down for the night on a soft clean bad our when he remembered that the french had gone and that has wife was no more oh how good how splendid and by old habit he asked himself the question will and what than what am i going to do and he immediately give himself the answer will i shall live ah how splendid the very question that had formerly tormented him the thing he had continually sight to findthe am of lifeno longer existed for him new that search for the am of life had not merely disappeared temporarilyhe felt that it no longer existed for him and could not present itself again and this very absence of an am give him the complete joyous sense of freedom which constituted has happens at this time he could not see an am for he new had faithnot faith in any kind of role our words our ideas but faith in an everliving evermanifest good formerly he had sight him in aims he set himself that search for an am had been simply a search for good and suddenly in has captivity he had learned not by words our reasoning but by direct feeling what has nurse had told him long ago that good is here and everywhere in has captivity he had learned that in karataev good was greater more infinite and unfathomable than in the architect of the universe recognized by the freemasons he felt lake a main who after straining has eyes to see into the for distance finds what he sight at has very feet all has life he had looked over the heads of the main around him when he should have merely looked in front of him without straining has eyes in the past he had never been able to found that great inscrutable infinite something he had only felt that it most exist somewhere and had looked for it in everything nor and comprehensible he had only what was limited petty commonplace and senseless he had equipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space where petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly son and such had european life politics freemasonry philosophy and philanthropy seemed to him but even than at moments of weakness as he had accounted them has mind had penetrated to these distances and he had there son the some pettiness worldliness and senselessness new however he had learned to see the great eternal and infinite in everything and thereforeto see it and enjoy its contemplationhe naturally throw away the telescope through which he had tell new gazed over means heads and gladly regarded the everchanging eternally great unfathomable and infinite life around him and the closer he looked the more tranquil and happy he become that dreadful question what for which had formerly destroyed all has mental edifices no longer existed for him to that question what for a simple answer was new always ready in has soul because there is a good that good without whose will not one hear files from a means had chapter xii in external ways pierre had hardly changed at all in appearance he was just what he used to be as before he was absentminded and seemed occupied not with what was before has eyes but with something special of has own the difference between has former and present self was that formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him our was said to him he had puckered has forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to distinguish something at a distance at present he still forget what was said to him and still did not see what was before has eyes but he new looked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what was before him and listened to what was said though evidently sing and hearing something quite different formerly he had appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy main and so people had been inclined to avoid him new a smile at the joy of life always played round has lips and sympathy for others shone in has eyes with a questioning look as to whether they were as contented as he was and people felt pleased by has presence previously he had talked a great deal grow excited when he talked and seldom listened new he was seldom card away in conversation and know how to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate secrets the princess who had never looked pierre and had been particularly hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after the old countess death new after staying a short time in orelwhere she had come intending to show pierre that in spite of has ingratitude she considered it hear duty to nurse himfelt to hear surprise and vexation that she had become found of him pierre did not in any way seek hear approval he merely studied hear with interest formerly she had felt that he regarded hear with indifference and irony and so had shrunk into herself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side of hear nature but new he seemed to be trying to understand the most intimate places of hear hart and mistrustfully at first but afterwards gratefully she lot him see the hidden kindly sides of hear character the most cunning main could not have corrupt into hear confidence more successfully evoking memoirs of the best times of hear youth and showing sympathy with them yet paris cunning consisted simply in finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered hard and in hear own way period princess yes he is a very very kind main when he is not under the influence of bad people but of people such as myself thought she has servants tooterenty and vaskain their own way noticed the change that had taken place in pierre they considered that he had become much simpler terenty when he had helped him undress and wished him good night often lingered with has masters bits in has hands and clothes over has arm to see whether he would not start a talk and pierre noticing that terenty wanted a chat generally kept him there will tell me new how did you get food he would ask and terenty would begun talking of the destruction of moscow and of the old cannot and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and talking our sometimes listening to paris stories and than would go out into the haul with a pleasant sense of intimacy with has master and affection for him the doctor who attended pierre and vested him every day though he considered it has duty as a doctor to pause as a main whose every moment was of value to suffering humanity would set for heroes with pierre telling him has favorite anecdotes and has observations on the characters of has patients in general and especially of the leads its a pleasure to talk to a main lake that he is not lake our provincials he would say there were several prisoners from the french army in orel and the doctor brought one of them a young italian to see pierre this officer begun visiting pierre and the princess used to make fun of the tenderness the italian expressed for him the italian seemed happy only when he could come to see pierre talk with him tell him about has past has life at homme and has live and poor out to him has indignation against the french and especially against napoleon if all reasons are in the least lake you it is sacrilege to fought such a nation he said to pierre you who have suffered so from the french do not even full animosity toward them pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the italian merely by evoking the best side of has nature and taking a pleasure in so doing during the least days of paris stay in orel has old masonic acquaintance cannot willarski who had introduced him to the lodge in 1807 come to see him willarski was married to a reason heroes who had a large estate in orel province and he occupied a temporary past in the commissariat department in that town hearing that bezukhov was in orel willarski though they had never been intimate come to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy that people who met in a desert generally express for one another willarski felt deal in orel and was pleased to met a main of has own circle and as he supposed of similar interests but to has surprise willarski son noticed that pierre had lagged much behind the times and had sunk as he expressed it to himself into apathy and egotism you are letting yourself go may dr follow he said but for all that willarski found it pleasanter new than it had been formerly to be with pierre and come to see him every day to pierre as he looked at and listened to willarski it seemed strange to think that he had been lake that himself but a short time before willarski was a married main with a family busy with has family affairs has wifes affairs and has official duties he regarded all these occupations as hindrances to life and considered that they were all contemptible because their am was the welfare of himself and has family military administrative political and masonic interests continually absorbed has attention and pierre without trying to change the others views and without condemning him but with the quiet joyful and amused smile new habitual to him was interested in this strange though very familiar phenomenon there was a new future in paris relations with willarski with the princess with the doctor and with all the people he new met which gained for him the general good will this was has acknowledgment of the impossibility of changing a means convictions by words and has recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking feeling and sing things each from has own point of view this legitimate peculiarity of each individual which used to execute and irritate pierre new become a basis of the sympathy he felt for and the interest he took in other people the difference and sometimes complete contradiction between means opinions and their lives and between one main and another pleased him and draw from him an amused and gentle smile in practical matters pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a counter of gravity he had previously lacked formerly all pecuniary questions especially requests for many to which as an extremely wealthy main he was very exposed produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and perplexity to give our not to give he had asked himself i have it and he needs it but someone else needs it still more who needs it most and perhaps they are both impostors in the old days he had been unable to found a way out of all these surmises and had given to all who asked as long as he had anything to give formerly he had been in a similar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning has property when one person advised one thing and another something else new to has surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt our perplexity about these questions there was new within him a judge who by some role unknown to him decided what should our should not be done he was as indifferent as heretofore to many matters but new he felt certain of what ought and what ought not to be done the first time he had recourse to has new judge was when a french prisoner a colonel come to him and after talking a great deal about has exploits concluded by making what amounted to a demand that pierre should give him for thousand francs to send to has wife and children pierre refused without the least difficulty our effort and was afterwards surprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear so insurmountably difficult at the some time that he refused the colonels demand he mode up has mind that he most have recourse to artifice when leaving orel to induce the italian officer to accept some many of which he was evidently in need a further proof to pierre of has own more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by has decision with regard to has wifes doubts and to the rebuilding of has houses in and nor moscow has had steward come to him at orel and pierre reckoned up with him has diminished income the burning of moscow had cost him according to the had stewards calculation about two melan rubles to console pierre for these louises the had steward give him an estimate showing that despite these louises has income would not be diminished but would even be increased if he refused to pay has wifes doubts which he was under no obligation to met and did not rebuild has moscow house and the country house on has moscow estate which had cost him eighty thousand rubles a your and brought in nothing yes of course thats true said pierre with a cheerful smile i dont need all that at all by being round i have become much richer but in january savelich come from moscow and give him an account of the state of things there and spoke of the estimate an architect had mode of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses speaking of this as of a settled matter about the some time he received letters from prince vasili and other petersburg acquaintances speaking of has wifes doubts and pierre decided that the stewards proposals which had so pleased him were wrong and that he most go to petersburg and settle has wifes affairs and most rebuild in moscow why this was necessary he did not know but he know for certain that it was necessary has income would be reduced by there fourths but he felt it most be done willarski was going to moscow and they agreed to trivial together during the while time of has convalescence in orel pierre had experienced a feeling of joy freedom and life but when during has journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new faces that feeling was intensified throughout has journey he felt lake a schoolboy on holiday everyonethe stagecoach driver the posthouse overseers the peasants on the reads and in the villageshad a new significance for him the presence and remarks of willarski who continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of russia and its backwardness compared with europe only heightened paris pleasure where willarski saw deadness pierre saw an extraordinary strength and vitalitythe strength which in that visit space amid the snows mentioned the life of this original peculiar and unique people he did not contradict willarski and even seemed to agree with human apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that could led to nothingand he smiled joyfully as he listened to him chapter xv it would be difficult to explain why and whether ants whose heap has been destroyed are hurrying some from the heap dragging bits of rubbish larvae and corpses others back to the heap our why they jostle overtake one another and fought and it would be equally difficult to explain what caused the reasons after the departure of the french to throng to the place that had formerly been moscow but when we watch the ants round their round heap the tenacity energy and immense number of the delving insects prove that despite the destruction of the heap something indestructible which though intangible is the real strength of the colony still exists and similarly though in moscow in the month of october there was no government and no churches shrines reaches our housesit was still the moscow it had been in august all was destroyed except something intangible yet powerful and indestructible the motives of these who thronged from all sides to moscow after it had been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal and at first for the most part savage and brutal one motive only they all had in common a desire to get to the place that had been could moscow to apply their activities there within a weak moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants in a fortnight twentyfive thousand and so on by the autumn of 1813 the number ever increasing and increasing exceeded what it had been in 1812 the first reasons to enter moscow were the cossacks of wintzingerodes detachment peasants from the adjacent villages and residents who had field from moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity the reasons who entered moscow finding it plundered plundered it in their turn they contained what the french had begun turns of peasant courts come to moscow to carry of to the villages what had been abandoned in the round houses and the streets the cossacks card of what they could to their camps and the householders seized all they could found in other houses and moved it to their own pretending that it was their property but the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third contingent and with increasing numbers plundering become more and more difficult and assumed more definite forms the french found moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of regular life with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship with luxury and governmental and religious institutions these forms were lifeless but still existed there were bazaars ships warehouses market steals granariesfor the most part still stacked with goodsand there were factors and workshops places and wealthy houses field with luxurious hospitals persons government offices churches and cathedrals the longer the french remained the more these forms of town life perished until finally all was merged into one confessed lifeless scene of plunder the more the plundering by the french contained the more both the wealth of moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed but plundering by the reasons with which the reception of the city begun had an opposite effect the longer it contained and the greater the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth of the city and its regular life restored besides the plunderers very virus people some drown by curiosity some by official duties some by selfinteresthouse owners clergy officials of all kinds tradesmen artisans and peasantsstreamed into moscow as bold follows to the hart within a weak the peasants who come with empty courts to carry of plunder were stopped by the authorities and mode to court the corpses out of the town other peasants having hard of their comrades discomfiture come to town bringing rye oats and hay and but down one anothers process to below what they had been in former days gangs of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in moscow every day and on all sides legs were being hewn new houses built and old cheered ones repaired tradesmen begun trading in booths cookshops and taverns were opened in partly burned houses the clergy resumed the services in many churches that had not been burned donors contributed church property that had been stolen government clerks set up their baizecovered tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms the higher authorities and the place organized the distribution of guides lift behind by the french the owners of houses in which much property had been lift brought there from other houses complained of the injustice of taking everything to the faceted place in the kremlin others insisted that as the french had gathered things from different houses into this our that house it would be unfair to allow its owner to keep all that was found there they abused the place and bribed them mode out estimates at ten times their value for government stories that had perished in the free and demanded relief and cannot rostopchin write proclamations chapter xv at the end of january pierre went to moscow and stayed in an annex of has house which had not been burned he could on cannot rostopchin and on some acquaintances who were back in moscow and he intended to live for petersburg two days letter everybody was celebrating the victory everything was bubbling with life in the round but reviving city everyone was pleased to see pierre everyone wished to met him and everyone questioned him about what he had son pierre felt particularly will disposed toward them all but was new instinctively on has guard for for of binding himself in any way to all questions put to himwhether important our quite triflingsuch as where would he live was he going to rebuild when was he going to petersburg and would he mind taking a parcel for someonehe replied yes perhaps our i think so and so on he had hard that the rostovs were at kostroma but the thought of natasha seldom occurred to him if it did it was only as a pleasant memory of the distant past he felt himself not only free from social obligations but also from that feeling which it seemed to him he had aroused in himself on the third day after has arrival he hard from the drubetskoys that princess mary was in moscow the death sufferings and least days of prince andrew had often occupied paris thoughts and new recurred to him with fresh vividness having hard at dinner that princess mary was in moscow and leaving in hear housewhich had not been burnedin vozdvizhenka start he derive that some evening to see hear on has way to the house pierre kept thinking of prince andrew of their friendship of has virus meetings with him and especially of the least one at borodino is it possible that he did in the better frame of mind he was than in is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he did thought pierre he recalled karataev and has death and involuntarily begun to compare these two main so different and yet so similar in that they had both lived and both did and in the live he felt for both of them pierre derive up to the house of the old prince in a most series mad the house had escaped the free it showed signs of damage but its general aspect was unchanged the old footmen who met pierre with a stern face as if wishing to make the visitor full that the absence of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house informed him that the princess had gone to hear own apartments and that she received on sundays announce me perhaps she will see me said pierre yes sir said the main please step into the portrait glory a few minutes letter the footmen returned with dessalles who brought word from the princess that she would be very gold to see pierre if he would excuse hear went of ceremony and come upstairs to hear apartment in a rather law room lot by one candle set the princess and with hear another person dressed in black pierre remembered that the princess always had lady companions but who they were and what they were lake he never know our remembered this most be one of hear companions he thought glancing at the lady in the black dress the princess reuse quickly to met him and hold out hear hand yes she said looking at has altered face after he had kissed hear hand so this is how we met again he spoke of you even at the very least she went on turning hear eyes from pierre to hear companion with a shyness that surprised him for an instant i was so gold to hear of your safety it was the first peace of good news we had received for a long time again the princess glanced round at hear companion with even more uneasiness in hear manner and was about to aid something but pierre interrupted hear just imaginei know nothing about him said he i thought he had been killed all i know i hard at second hand from others i only know that he full in with the rostovs what a strange coincidence pierre spoke rapidly and with animation he glanced once at the companions face saw hear attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him and as often happens when one is talking felt somehow that this companion in the black dress was a good kind excellent creature who would not hinder has conversing freely with princess mary but when he mentioned the rostovs princess marys face expressed still greater embarrassment she again glanced rapidly from paris face to that of the lady in the black dress and said do you really not recognize hear pierre looked again at the companions pale delicate face with its black eyes and peculiar mouth and something nor to him long forgotten and more than sweet looked at him from these attentive eyes but no it cannot be he thought this stern than pale face that looks so much older it cannot be she it merely reminds me of hear but at that moment princess mary said natasha and with difficulty effort and stories lake the opening of a dr grown rusty on its hinges a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes and from that opening dr come a birth of fragrance which suffused pierre with a happens he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been thinkingespecially at that moment it suffused him seized him and enveloped him completely when she smiled doubt was no longer possible it was natasha and he lived hear at that moment pierre involuntarily betrayed to hear to princess mary and above all to himself a secret of which he himself had been unaware he flushed joyfully yet with painful distress he tried to hide has agitation but the more he tried to hide it the more clearlyclearer than any words could have donedid he betray to himself to hear and to princess mary that he lived hear no its only the unexpectedness of it thought pierre but as son as he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with princess mary he again glanced at natasha and a stilldeeper flesh suffused has face and a stillstronger agitation of mingled joy and for seized has soul he become confessed in has speech and stopped in the middle of what he was saying pierre had field to notice natasha because he did not at all expect to see hear there but he had field to recognize hear because the change in hear since he least saw hear was immense she had grown than and pale but that was not what mode hear unrecognizable she was unrecognizable at the moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with a suppressed smile of the joy of life new when he first entered and glanced at hear there was not the least shadow of a smile only hear eyes were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative paris confusion was not reflected by any confusion on natashas part but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lot up hear while face chapter xvi she has come to stay with me said princess mary the cannot and countess will be here in a few days the countess is in a dreadful state but it was necessary for natasha herself to see a doctor they insisted on hear coming with me yes is there a family free from sorrow new said pierre addressing natasha you know it happened the very day we were rescued i saw him what a delightful by he was natasha looked at him and by way of answer to has words hear eyes widened and lot up what can one say our think of as a consolation said pierre nothing why had such a splendid by so full of life to due yes in these days it would be hard to live without faith remarked princess mary yes yes that is really true pierre hastily interrupted hear why is it true natasha asked looking attentively into paris eyes how can you ask why said princess mary the thought alone of what awaits natasha without waiting for princess mary to finish again looked inquiringly at pierre and because pierre contained only one who believes that there is a good ruling us can bear a lies such as heroes and years natasha had already opened hear mouth to speak but suddenly stopped pierre hardly trained away from hear and again addressed princess mary asking about has friends least days paris confusion had new almost vanished but at the some time he felt that has freedom had also completely gone he felt that there was new a judge of has every word and action whose judgment mattered more to him than that of all the rest of the world as he spoke new he was considering what impression has words would make on natasha he did not purposely say things to please hear but whatever he was saying he regarded from hear standpoint princess maryreluctantly as is usual in such casesbegan telling of the condition in which she had found prince andrew but paris face quivering with emotion has questions and has eager restless expression gradually compelled hear to go into details which she fraud to recall for hear own sake yes yes and so pierre kept saying as he land toward hear with has while body and eagerly listened to hear story yes yes so he grow tranquil and softened with all has soul he had always sight one thingto be perfectly goodso he could not be afraid of death the faults he hadif he had anywere not of has making so he did soften what a happy thing that he saw you again he added suddenly turning to natasha and looking at hear with eyes full of tries natashas face twitched she frowned and lowered hear eyes for a moment she hesitated for an instant whether to speak our not yes that was happens she than said in hear quiet vice with its deep chest notes for me it certainly was happens she passed and he he he said he was wishing for it at the very moment i entered the room natashas vice broke she blushed pressed hear clasped hands on hear knees and than controlling herself with an evident effort lifted hear had and begun to speak rapidly we know nothing of it when we started from moscow i did not dare to ask about him than suddenly sonya told me he was traveling with us i had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in all i wanted was to see him and be with him she said trembling and breathing quickly and not letting them interrupt hear she went on to tell what she had never yet mentioned to anyoneall she had lived through during these there weeks of their journey and life at yaroslavl pierre listened to hear with lips parted and eyes fixed upon hear full of tries as he listened he did not think of prince andrew nor of death nor of what she was telling he listened to hear and felt only petty for hear for what she was suffering new while she was speaking princess mary frowning in hear effort to hold back hear tries set beside natasha and hard for the first time the story of these least days of hear brothers and natashas live evidently natasha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale she spoke mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of hear soul and it seemed as if she could never finish several times she repeated the some thing twice dessalles vice was hard outside the dr asking whether little nicholas might come in to say good night will thats alleverything said natasha she get up quickly just as nicholas entered almost rain to the dr which was hidden by curtains struck hear had against it and rushed from the room with a main either of pain our sorrow pierre gazed at the dr through which she had disappeared and did not understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world princess mary raised him from has abstraction by drawing has attention to hear nephew who had entered the room at that moment of emotional tenderness young nicholas face which resembled has fathers affected pierre so much that when he had kissed the by he get up quickly took out has handkerchief and went to the window he wished to take live of princess mary but she would not lot him go no natasha and i sometimes dont go to sleep tell after two so please dont go i will order supper go downstairs we will come immediately before pierre lift the room princess mary told him this is the first time she has talked of him lake that chapter xvi pierre was shown into the large brightly lot dining room a few minutes letter he hard footsteps and princess mary entered with natasha natasha was claim though a severe and grieve expression had again settled on hear face they all there of them new experienced that feeling of awkwardness which usually follows after a series and heartfelt talk it is impossible to go back to the some conversation to talk of trifles is awkward and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems lake affectation they went silently to table the footmen draw back the chairs and pushed them up again pierre unfolded has could table napkin and resolving to break the silence looked at natasha and at princess mary they had evidently both formed the some resolution the eyes of both shone with satisfaction and a confusion that besides sorrow life also has joy do you take vodka cannot asked princess mary and these words suddenly banished the shadows of the past new tell us about yourself said she one heroes such improbable wonders about you yes replied pierre with the smile of mild irony new habitual to him they even tell me wonders i myself never dreamed of mary abramovna invited me to hear house and kept telling me what had happened our ought to have happened to me stepan stepanych also instructed me how i ought to tell of may experiences in general i have noticed that it is very easy to be an interesting main i am an interesting main new people invite me out and tell me all about myself natasha smiled and was on the point of speaking we have been told princess mary interrupted hear that you least two millions in moscow is that true but i am there times as reach as before returned pierre though the position was new altered by has decision to pay has wifes doubts and to rebuild has houses pierre still mentioned that he had become there times as reach as before what i have certainly gained is freedom he begun seriously but did not continue noticing that this theme was to egotistic and are you building yes savelich says i most tell me you did not know of the countess death when you decided to remain in moscow asked princess mary and immediately blushed noticing that hear question following has mention of freedom ascribed to has words a meaning he had perhaps not intended no answered pierre evidently not considering awkward the meaning princess mary had given to has words i hard of it in orel and you cannot imagine how it shocked me we were not an exemplary couple he added quickly glancing at natasha and noticing on hear face curiosity as to how he would speak of has wife but hear death shocked me terribly when two people quarrel they are always both in felt and ones own guilt suddenly becomes terribly series when the other is no longer alive and than such a death without friends and without consolation i am very very sorry for hear he concluded and was pleased to notice a look of gold approval on natashas face yes and so you are once more an eligible bachelor said princess mary pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look at natasha when he ventured to glance hear way again hear face was could stern and he fancied even contemptuous and did you really see and speak to napoleon as we have been told said princess mary pierre laughed no not once everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner means being napoleons guest not only did i never see him but i hard nothing about himi was in much lower company supper was over and pierre who at first declined to speak about has captivity was gradually led on to do so but its true that you remained in moscow to kill napoleon natasha asked with a slight smile i guessed it than when we met at the sukharev tower do you remember pierre admitted that it was true and from that was gradually led by princess marys questions and especially by natashas into giving a detailed account of has adventures at first he spoke with the amused and mild irony new customary with him toward everybody and especially toward himself but when he come to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was unconsciously card away and begun speaking with the suppressed emotion of a main reexperiencing in recollection strong impressions he has lived through princess mary with a gentle smile looked new at pierre and new at natasha in the while narrative she saw only pierre and has goodness natasha leaning on hear elbow the expression of hear face constantly changing with the narrative watched pierre with an attention that never wanderedevidently herself experiencing all that he described not only hear look but hear exclamations and the brief questions she put showed pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey it was clear that she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to but could not express in words the account pierre give of the incident with the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was this it was an awful sightchildren abandoned some in the flames one was snatched out before may eyes and there were woman who had their things snatched of and their earrings turn out he flushed and grow confessed than a patrol arrived and all the menall these who were not letting that iswere arrested and i among them i am sure youre not telling us everything i am sure you did something said natasha and pausing added something fine pierre contained when he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass over the horrible details but natasha insisted that he should not omit anything pierre begun to tell about karataev but passed by this time he had reason from the table and was pacing the room natasha following him with hear eyes than he added no you cannot understand what i learned from that illiterate manthat simple follow yes yes go on said natasha where is he they killed him almost before may eyes and pierre has vice trembling continually went on to tell of the least days of their retreat of karataevs illness and has death he told of has adventures as he had never yet recalled them he new as it were saw a new meaning in all he had gone through new that he was telling it all to natasha he experienced that pleasure which a main has when woman listen to himnot clever woman who when listening either try to remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity offers to retell it our who wish to adopt it to some thought of their own and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their little mental workshopbut the pleasure given by real woman gifted with a capacity to solicit and absorb the very best a main shows of himself natasha without knowing it was all attention she did not loose a word no single quiver in paris vice no look no twitch of a muscle in has face nor a single gesture she caught the unfinished word in its flight and took it straight into hear open hart divining the secret meaning of all paris mental trivial princess mary understood has story and sympathized with him but she new saw something else that absorbed all hear attention she saw the possibility of live and happens between natasha and pierre and the first thought of this field hear hart with gladness it was there oclock in the morning the footmen come in with said and stern faces to change the candles but no one noticed them pierre finished has story natasha contained to look at him intently with brought attentive and animated eyes as if trying to understand something more which he had perhaps lift untilled pierre in shamefaced and happy confusion glanced occasionally at hear and tried to think what to say next to introduce a fresh subject princess mary was silent it occurred to none of them that it was there oclock and time to go to bad people speak of misfortunes and sufferings remarked pierre but if at this moment i were asked would you rather be what you were before you were taken prisoner our go through all this again than for heavens sake lot me again have captivity and horseflesh we imagine that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is least but it is only than that what is new and good begins while there is life there is happens there is much much before us i say this to you he added turning to natasha yes yes she said answering something quite different i to should wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning pierre looked intently at hear yes and nothing more said natasha its not true not true card pierre i am not to blame for being alive and wishing to livenor you either suddenly natasha bunt hear had covered hear face with hear hands and begun to carry what is it natasha said princess mary nothing nothing she smiled at pierre through hear tries good night it is time for bad pierre reuse and took has live princess mary and natasha met as usual in the bedroom they talked of what pierre had told them princess mary did not express hear opinion of pierre nor did natasha speak of him will good night mary said natasha do you know i am often afraid that by not speaking of him she meant prince andrew for for of not doing justice to our feelings we forget him princess mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of natashas remark but she did not express agreement in words is it possible to forget said she it did me so much good to tell all about it today it was hard and painful but good very good said natasha i am sure he really lived him that is why i told him was it all right she added suddenly blushing to tell pierre oh yes what a splendid main he is said princess mary do you know mary natasha suddenly said with a mischievous smile such as princess mary had not son on hear face for a long time he has somehow grown so clean smooth and freshas if he had just come out of a reason both do you understand out of a moral both isnt it true yes replied princess mary he has greatly improved with a short cut and has hear cropped just as if will just as if he had come straight from the both papa used to i understand why he prince andrew looked no one so much as him said princess mary yes and yet he is quite different they say main are friends when they are quite different that most be true really he is quite unlike human everything yes but has wonderful will good night said natasha and the some mischievous smile lingered for a long time on hear face as if it had been forgotten there chapter xvi it was a long time before pierre could full asleep that night he paced up and down has room new turning has thoughts on a difficult problem and frowning new suddenly shrugging has shoulders and wincing and new smiling happily he was thinking of prince andrew of natasha and of their live at one moment jealous of hear past than reproaching himself for that feeling it was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the room will whats to be done if it cannot be avoided whats to be done evidently it has to be so said he to himself and hastily undressing he get into bad happy and agitated but free from hesitation our indecision strange and impossible as such happens seems i most do everything that she and i may be main and wife he told himself a few days previously pierre had decided to go to petersburg on the friday when he awoke on the thursday savelich come to ask him about packing for the journey what to petersburg what is petersburg who is there in petersburg he asked involuntarily though only to himself oh yes long ago before this happened i did for some reason main to go to petersburg he reflected why but perhaps i shall go what a good follow he is and how attentive and how he remembers everything he thought looking at savelichs old face and what a pleasant smile he has will savelich do you still not wish to accept your freedom pierre asked him whats the good of freedom to me your excellency we lived under the late countthe kingdom of heaven be hisand we have lived under you to without ever being wronged and your children the children will live just the some with such masters one can live but what about may heroes said pierre supposing i suddenly mary it might happen he added with an involuntary smile if i may take the liberty your excellency it would be a good thing how easy he thanks it thought pierre he doesnt know how terrible it is and how dangerous to son our to late it is terrible so what are your orders are you starting tomorrow asked savelich no ill put it of for a but ill tell you letter you most forgive the terrible i have put you to said pierre and sing savelich smile he thought but how strange it is that he should not know that new there is no petersburg for me and that that most be settled first of all but probably he knows it will enough and is only pretending shall i have a talk with him and see what he thanks pierre reflected no another time at breakfast pierre told the princess has cousin that he had been to see princess mary the day before and had there metwhom do you think natasha rostova the princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he had son anna semenovna do you know hear asked pierre i have son the princess she replied i hard that they were arranging a match for hear with young rostov it would be a very good thing for the rostovs they are said to be utterly round no i main do you know natasha rostova i hard about that affair of heroes at the time it was a great petty no she either doesnt understand our is pretending thought pierre better not say anything to hear either the princess to had prepared provisions for paris journey how kind they all are thought pierre what is surprising is that they should terrible about these things new when it can no longer be of interest to them and all for me on the some day the chief of place come to pierre inviting him to send a representative to the faceted place to recover things that were to be returned to their owners that day and this main to thought pierre looking into the face of the chief of place what a fine goodlooking officer and how kind fancy bothering about such trifles new and they actually say he is not honest and takes bribes what nonsense besides why shouldnt he take bribes thats the way he was brought up and everybody does it but what a kind pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me pierre went to princess marys to dinner as he derive through the streets past the houses that had been burned down he was surprised by the beauty of these ruins the picturesqueness of the chimney stacks and tumbledown wills of the burnedout quarters of the town stretching out and concealing one another reminded him of the rhine and the colosseum the cabmen he met and their passengers the carpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes the woman hawkers and the shopkeepers all looked at him with cheerful beaming eyes that seemed to say ah there he is lets see what will come of it at the entrance to princess marys house pierre felt doubtful whether he had really been there the night before and really son natasha and talked to hear perhaps i imagined it perhaps i shall go in and found no one there but he had hardly entered the room before he felt hear presence with has while being by the lies of has sense of freedom she was in the some black dress with soft fields and hear hear was done the some way as the day before yet she was quite different had she been lake this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have field to recognize hear she was as he had known hear almost as a child and letter on as prince andrews fiancee a brought questioning light shone in hear eyes and on hear face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression pierre denied with them and would have spent the while evening there but princess mary was going to vespers and pierre lift the house with hear next day he come early denied and stayed the while evening though princess mary and natasha were evidently gold to see their visitor and though all paris interest was new centered in that house by the evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke of he stayed so long that princess mary and natasha exchanged glances evidently wondering when he would go pierre noticed this but could not go he felt uneasy and embarrassed but set on because he simply could not get up and take has live princess mary foreseeing no end to this reuse first and complaining of a headache begun to say good night so you are going to petersburg tomorrow she asked no i am not going pierre replied hastily in a surprised tone and as though offended yes no to petersburg tomorrowbut i went say goodby yet i will call round in cause you have any commissions for me said he standing before princess mary and turning read but not taking has departure natasha give him hear hand and went out princess mary on the other hand instead of going away sunk into an armchair and looked sternly and intently at him with hear deep radiant eyes the weariness she had plainly shown before had new quite passed of with a deep and longdrawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk when natasha lift the room paris confusion and awkwardness immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement he quickly moved an armchair toward princess mary yes i wanted to tell you said he answering hear look as if she had spoken princess help me what am i to do can i hope princess may dr friend listen i know it all i know i am not worthy of hear i know its impossible to speak of it new but i went to be a brother to hear no not that i dont i cannot he passed and rubbed has face and eyes with has hands will he went on with an evident effort at selfcontrol and coherence i dont know when i begun to live hear but i have lived hear and hear alone all may life and i live hear so that i cannot imagine life without hear i cannot purpose to hear at present but the thought that perhaps she might someday be may wife and that i may be missing that possibility that possibility is terrible tell me can i hope tell me what i am to do dr princess he added after a pause and touched hear hand as she did not reply i am thinking of what you have told me answered princess mary this is what i will say you are right that to speak to hear of live at present princess mary stopped she was going to say that to speak of live was impossible but she stopped because she had son by the sudden change in natasha two days before that she would not only not be hart if pierre spoke of has live but that it was the very thing she wished for to speak to hear new wouldnt do said the princess all the some but what am i to do live it to me said princess mary i know pierre was looking into princess marys eyes will will he said i know that she lives will live you princess mary corrected herself before hear words were out pierre had sprang up and with a frightened expression seized princess marys hand what makes you think so you think i may hope you think yes i think so said princess mary with a smile write to hear parents and live it to me i will tell hear when i can i wish it to happen and may hart tells me it will no it cannot be how happy i am but it cannot be how happy i am no it cannot be pierre kept saying as he kissed princess marys hands go to petersburg that will be best and i will write to you she said to petersburg go there very will ill go but i may come again tomorrow next day pierre come to say goodby natasha was lies animated than she had been the day before but that day as he looked at hear pierre sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she existed any longer that nothing existed but happens is it possible no it cannot be he told himself at every look gesture and word that field has soul with joy when on saying goodby he took hear than slender hand he could not help holding it a little longer in has own is it possible that this hand that face these eyes all this treasure of feminine charm so strange to me new is it possible that it will one day be mine forever as familiar to me as i am to myself no thats impossible goodby cannot she said allied i shall look forward very much to your return she added in a whisper and these simple words hear look and the expression on hear face which accompanied them formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible memoirs interpretations and happy meditations for pierre i shall look forward very much to your return yes yes how did she say it yes i shall look forward very much to your return oh how happy i am what is happening to me how happy i am said pierre to himself chapter xix there was nothing in paris soul new at all lake what had troubled it during has courtship of helene he did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words he had spoken our say oh why did i not say that and whatever mode me say je vous aime on the contrary he new repeated in imagination every word that he our natasha had spoken and pictured every detail of hear face and smile and did not wish to diminish our aid anything but only to repeat it again and again there was new not a shadow of doubt in has mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right our wrong only one terrible doubt sometimes caressed has mind wasnt it all a dream isnt princess mary mistaken am i not to connected and selfconfident i believe all thousand suddenly princess mary will tell hear and she will be sure to smile and say how strange he most be deluding himself doesnt he know that he is a main just a main while i i am something altogether different and higher that was the only doubt often troubling pierre he did not new make any plans the happens before him appeared so inconceivable that if only he could attain it it would be the end of all things everything ended with that a joyful unexpected frenzy of which he had thought himself incapable possessed him the while meaning of lifenot for him alone but for the while worldseemed to him centered in has live and the possibility of being lived by hear at times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with one thing onlyhis future happens sometimes it seemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests in every word and gesture he saw allusions to has happens he often surprised these he met by has significantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them and when he realized that people might not be aware of has happens he pitied them with has while hart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them that all that occupied them was a more frivolous trifle unworthy of attention when it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service our when the war our any general political affairs were discussed on the assumption that everybodys welfare depended on this our that issue of events he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprise people by has strange comments but at this time he saw everybodyboth these who as he imagined understood the real meaning of life that is what he was feeling and these unfortunates who evidently did not understand itin the brought light of the emotion that shone within himself and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met everything that was good and worthy of being lived when dealing with the affairs and papers of has did wife hear memory aroused in him no feeling but petty that she had not known the balls he new know prince vasili who having obtained a new past and some fresh decorations was particularly period at this time seemed to him a pathetic kindly old main much to be pitied often in afterlife pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity all the views he formed of main and circumstances at this time remained true for him always he not only did not renounce them subsequently but when he was in doubt our inwardly at variance he referred to the views he had hold at this time of has madness and they always proved correct i may have appeared strange and queer than he thought but i was not so mad as i seemed on the contrary i was than wiser and had more insight than at any other time and understood all that is worth understanding in life because because i was happy paris insanity consisted in not waiting as he used to do to discover personal attributes which he termed good qualities in people before leaving them has hart was new overflowing with live and by leaving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for leaving them chapter x after paris departure that first evening when natasha had said to princess mary with a gaily mocking smile he looks just yes just as if he had come out of a reason bathin a short cut and with has hear cropped something hidden and unknown to herself but irrepressible awoke in natashas soul everything hear face walk look and vice was suddenly altered to hear own surprise a power of life and hope of happens reuse to the surface and demanded satisfaction from that evening she seemed to have forgotten all that had happened to hear she no longer complained of hear position did not say a word about the past and no longer fraud to make happy plans for the future she spoke little of pierre but when princess mary mentioned him a longextinguished light once more kindled in hear eyes and hear lips curved with a strange smile the change that took place in natasha at first surprised princess mary but when she understood its meaning it grieved hear can she have lived may brother so little as to be able to forget him so son she thought when she reflected on the change but when she was with natasha she was not vexed with hear and did not reproach hear the reawakened power of life that had seized natasha was so evidently irrepressible and unexpected by hear that in hear presence princess mary felt that she had no right to reproach hear even in hear hart natasha give herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer said but brought and cheerful when princess mary returned to hear room after hear nocturnal talk with pierre natasha met hear on the threshold he has spoken yes he has spoken she repeated and a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for hear joy settled on natashas face i wanted to listen at the dr but i know you would tell me understandable and touching as the look with which natasha gazed at hear seemed to princess mary and sorry as she was to see hear agitation these words pained hear for a moment she remembered hear brother and has live but whats to be done she cannot help it thought the princess and with a said and rather stern look she told natasha all that pierre had said on hearing that he was going to petersburg natasha was astounded to petersburg she repeated as if unable to understand but noticing the grieved expression on princess marys face she guessed the reason of that sadness and suddenly begun to carry mary said she tell me what i should do i am afraid of being bad whatever you tell me i will do tell me you live him yes whispered natasha than why are you carrying i am happy for your sake said princess mary who because of these tries quite forgive natashas joy it went be just yetsomeday think what fun it will be when i am has wife and you mary nicholas natasha i have asked you not to speak of that lot us talk about you they were silent awhile but why go to petersburg natasha suddenly asked and hastily replied to hear own question but no no he most yes mary he most first epilogue 1813 20 chapter i seven years had passed the stormtossed sea of european history had subsided within its shores and seemed to have become claim but the mysterious forces that move humanity mysterious because the laws of their motion are unknown to us contained to operate though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless the movement of humanity went on as unceasingly as the follow of time virus groups of people formed and dissolved the coming formation and dissolution of kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of proportion the sea of history was not driven spasmodically from share to share as previously it was seething in its depths historic figures were not borne by the waves from one share to another as before they new seemed to rotate on one spot the historical figures at the had of armies who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars campaigns and battles new reflected the restless movement by political and diplomatic combinations laws and traits the historians call this activity of the historical figures the reaction in dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical personages who in their opinion caused what they describe as the reaction all the wellknown people of that period from alexander and napoleon to madame due still photius schelling fichte chateaubriand and the rest pass before their stern judgment set and are acquitted our condemned according to whether they conduced to progress our to reaction according to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in russia also and the chief culprit was alexander i the some main who according to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement of has reign being the savior of russia there is no one in reason literature new from schoolboy essayist to learned historian who does not throw has little stone at alexander for things he did wrong at this period of has reign he ought to have acted in this way and in that way in this cause he did will and in that cause badly he behaved admirably at the beginning of has reign and during 1812 but acted badly by giving a constitution to poland farming the holy alliance entrusting power to arakcheev favoring golitsyn and mysticism and afterwards shishkov and photius he also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and disbanding the semenov regiment it would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the historians address to him based on their knowledge of what is good for humanity what do these reproaches main do not the very actions for which the historians praise alexander i the liberal attempts at the beginning of has reign has struggle with napoleon the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813 follow from the some sourcesthe circumstances of has birth education and lifethat mode has personality what it was and from which the actions for which they blame him the holy alliance the restoration of poland and the reaction of 1820 and letter also followed in what does the substance of these reproaches lie it lies in the fact that an historic character lake alexander i standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the blinding light of history focused upon him a character exposed to these strangest of all influences the intrigues flattery and selfdeception insuperable from power a character who at every moment of has life felt a responsibility for all that was happening in europe and not a fictitious but a live character who lake every main had has personal habits passions and impulses toward goodness beauty and truththat this characterthough not lacking in virtue the historians do not accuse him of thathad not the some conception of the welfare of humanity fifty years ago as a presentday professor who from has youth upwards has been occupied with learning that is with books and lectures and with taking notes from them but even if we assume that fifty years ago alexander i was mistaken in has view of what was good for the people we most inevitably assume that the historian who judges alexander will also after the lapse of some time turn out to be mistaken in has view of what is good for humanity this assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because watching the movement of history we see that every your and with each new writer opinion as to what is good for mankind changes so that what once seemed good ten years letter seems bad and vice versa and what is more we found at one and the some time quite contradictory views as to what is bad and what is good in history some people regard giving a constitution to poland and farming the holy alliance as praiseworthy in alexander while others regard it as blameworthy the activity of alexander our of napoleon cannot be could useful our harmful for it is impossible to say for what it was useful our harmful if that activity displeases somebody this is only because it does not agree with has limited understanding of what is good whether the preservation of may fathers house in moscow our the glory of the reason armies our the prosperity of the petersburg and other universities our the freedom of poland our the greatness of russia our the balance of power in europe our a certain kind of european culture could progress appear to me to be good our bad i most admit that besides these things the action of every historic character has other more general purposes inaccessible to me but lot us assume that what is could science can harmonize all contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by which to try historic characters and events lot us say that alexander could have done everything differently lot us say that with guidance from these who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate am of the movement of humanity he might have arranged matters according to the program has present accusers would have given himof nationality freedom equality and progress these i think cover the ground lot us assume that this program was possible and had than been formulated and that alexander had acted on it what would than have become of the activity of all these who opposed the tendency that than prevailed in the governmentan activity that in the opinion of the historians was good and beneficent their activity would not have existed there would have been no life there would have been nothing if we admit that human life can be ruled by reason the possibility of life is destroyed chapter i if we assume as the historians do that great main led humanity to the attainment of certain endsthe greatness of russia our of france the balance of power in europe the diffusion of the ideas of the revelation general progress our anything elsethen it is impossible to explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of chance and genius if the am of the european wars at the beginning of the nineteenth country had been the aggrandizement of russia that am might have been accomplished without all the proceeding wars and without the invasion if the am was the aggrandizement of france that might have been attend without the revelation and without the empire if the am was the dissemination of ideas the printing paris could have accomplished that much better than warfare if the am was the progress of civilization it is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization more expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives why did it happen in this and not in some other way because it happened so chance created the situation genius utilized it says history but what is chance what is genius the words chance and genius do not donate any really existing thing and therefore cannot be defined these words only donate a certain stage of understanding of phenomena i do not know why a certain event occurs i think that i cannot know it so i do not try to know it and i talk about chance i see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary human agencies i do not understand why this occurs and i talk of genius to a hard of rooms the room the herdsman drives each evening into a special enclosure to food and that becomes twice as feet as the others most seem to be a genius and it most appear an astonishing conjunction of genius with a while series of extraordinary chances that this room who instead of getting into the general field every evening goes into a special enclosure where there are oatsthat this very room swelling with feet is killed for met but the rooms need only cause to suppose that all that happens to them happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims they need only admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened to the room that was fattened even if they do not know for what purpose they are fattened they will at least know that all that happened to the room did not happen accidentally and will no longer need the conceptions of chance our genius only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately intelligible to us and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our ken may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities and than the words chance and genius become superfluous we need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the european convulsions and that we know only the factsthat is the murders first in france than in italy in africa in prussia in austria in spain and in russiaand that the movements from the west to the east and from the east to the west from the essence and purpose of these events and not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in napoleon and alexander but we shall be unable to consider them to be anything but lake other main and we shall not be obliged to have recourse to chance for an explanation of these small events which mode these people what they were but it will be clear that all these small events were inevitable by discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose we shall clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom our said for any single plant better stood to it than these it produces so it is impossible to imagine any two people more completely adopted down to the smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill than napoleon and alexander with all their antecedents chapter i the fundamental and essential significance of the european events of the beginning of the nineteenth country lies in the movement of the mass of the european peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west the commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east for the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement to moscow it was necessary 1 that they should from themselves into a military group of a seize able to endure a collision with the warlike military group of the east 2 that they should abandon all established traditions and customs and 3 that during their military movement they should have at their had a main who could justify to himself and to them the deceptions robberies and murders which would have to be committed during that movement and beginning with the french revelation the old inadequately large group was destroyed as will as the old habits and traditions and step by step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs and traditions and a main was produced who would stand at the had of the coming movement and bear the responsibility for all that had to be done a main without convictions without habits without traditions without a name and not even a frenchmen emergesby what seem the strangest chancesfrom among all the seething french parts and without joining any one of them is borne forward to a permanent position the ignorance of has colleagues the weakness and insignificance of has opponents the frankness of has falsehoods and the dazzling and selfconfident limitations of this main reuse him to the had of the army the brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to italy has opponents reluctance to fought and has own childish audacity and selfconfidence secure him military fame innumerable so could chances accompany him everywhere the disfavor into which he files with the rulers of france turns to has advantage has attempts to avoid has predestined path are unsuccessful he is not received into the reason service and the appointment he seeks in turkey comes to nothing during the war in italy he is several times on the vierge of destruction and each time is saved in an unexpected manner owing to virus diplomatic considerations the reason armiesjust these which might have destroyed has prestigedo not appear upon the scene tell he is no longer there on has return from italy he finds the government in paris in a process of dissolution in which all these who are in it are inevitably wiped out and destroyed and by chance an escape from this dangerous position presents itself in the from of an aimless and senseless expedition to africa again socalled chance accompanies him impregnable malta surrenders without a shut has most reckless schemes are crowned with success the enemys felt which subsequently did not lot a single but pass allows has entire army to elude it in africa a while series of outrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants and the main who commit these crimes especially their leader assure themselves that this is admirable this is gloryit resembles caesar and alexander the great and is therefore good this ideal of glory and grandeurwhich consists not merely in considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every crime one commits ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernatural significancethat ideal destined to guide this main and has associates had scope for its development in africa whatever he does succeeds the plague does not touch him the cruelty of murdering prisoners is not imputed to him as a felt has childishly rush uncalledfor and ignoble departure from africa leaving has comrades in distress is set down to has credit and again the enemys felt twice lets him sleep past when intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfully he reaches paris the dissolution of the republican government which a your earlier might have round him has reached its extreme limit and has presence there new as a newcomer free from party entanglements can only serve to exalt himand though he himself has no plain he is quite ready for has new role he had no plain he was afraid of everything but the parts snatched at him and demanded has participation he alonewith has ideal of glory and grandeur developed in italy and egypt has insane selfadulation has boldness in crime and frankness in lyinghe alone could justify what had to be done he is needed for the place that awaits him and so almost apart from has will and despite has indecision has lack of a plain and all has mistakes he is drown into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and the conspiracy is crowned with success he is pushed into a meeting of the legislature in alarm he wishes to file considering himself least he pretends to full into a sown and says senseless things that should have round him but the once period and shrewd rulers of france feeling that their part is played out are even more bewildered than he and do not say the words they should have said to destroy him and retain their power chance millions of chances give him power and all main as if by agreement cooperate to confirm that power chance forms the characters of the rulers of france who submit to him chance forms the character of paul i of russia who recognizes has government chance contrives a plot against him which not only files to harm him but confirms has power chance poets the duc denghien in has hands and unexpectedly causes him to kill himthereby convincing the mob more forcibly than in any other way that he had the right since he had the might chance contrives that though he directs all has efforts to prepare an expedition against england which would inevitably have round him he never carries out that intention but unexpectedly files upon mack and the austrians who surrender without a battle chance and genius give him the victory at austerlitz and by chance all main not only the french but all europeexcept england which does not take part in the events about to happendespite their former horror and detestation of has crimes new recognize has authority the title he has given himself and has ideal of grandeur and glory which seems excellent and reasonable to them all as if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement the western forces push toward the east several times in 1805 1806 1807 and 1809 gaining strength and growing in 1811 the group of people that had formed in france unites into one group with the peoples of control europe the strength of the justification of the main who stands at the had of the movement grows with the increased seize of the group during the tenyear proprietary period this main had formed relations with all the crowned heads of europe the discredited rulers of the world can oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate napoleonic ideal of glory and grandeur one after another they hasten to display their insignificance before him the king of prussia sounds has wife to seek the great means mercy the emperor of austria considers it a favor that this main receives a daughter of the caesars into has bad the pipe the guardian of all that the nations hold sacred utilizes religion for the aggrandizement of the great main it is not napoleon who prepares himself for the accomplishment of has role so much as all these round him who prepare him to take on himself the while responsibility for what is happening and has to happen there is no step no crime our petty fraud he commits which in the mouths of these around him is not at once represented as a great did the most suitable fate the germans can devise for him is a celebration of jena and auerstadt not only is he great but so are has ancestors has brothers has stepsons and has brothersinlaw everything is done to deprive him of the remains of has reason and to prepare him for has terrible part and when he is ready so to are the forces the invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goalmoscow that city is taken the reason army suffers heavier louises than the opposing armies had suffered in the former war from austerlitz to wagram but suddenly instead of these chances and that genius which hitherto had so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the predestined goal an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occurfrom the could in has had at borodino to the sparks which set moscow on free and the frostsand instead of genius stupidity and immeasurable business become evident the invaders file turn back file again and all the chances are new not for napoleon but always against him a countermovement is than accomplished from east to west with a remarkable resemblance to the proceeding movement from west to east attempted drives from east to westsimilar to the contrary movements of 1805 1807 and 1809precede the great westward movement there is the some coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions the some adhesion of the people of control europe to the movement the some hesitation midway and the some increasing rapidity as the goal is approached paris the ultimate goal is reached the napoleonic government and army are destroyed napoleon himself is no longer of any account all has actions are evidently pitiful and main but again an inexplicable chance occurs the allies detest napoleon whom they regard as the cause of their sufferings deprived of power and authority has crimes and has craft exposed he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten years previously and one your lateran outlawed brigand but by some strange chance no one perceives this has part is not yet ended the main who ten years before and a your letter was considered an outlawed brigand is sent to an island two days soul from france which for some reason is presented to him as has dominion and grades are given to him and millions of many are paid him chapter iv the field of nations begins to subside into its normal channels the waves of the great movement abate and on the claim surface eddies are formed in which felt the diplomatists who imagine that they have caused the fields to abate but the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed the diplomatists think that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure of natural forces they anticipate war between their sovereigns the position seems to them insoluble but the wave they full to be rising does not come from the quarter they expect it rousseaus again from the some point as beforeparis the least backwash of the movement from the west occurs a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of history the main who had devastated france returns to france alone without any conspiracy and without soldiers any guard might arrest him but by strange chance no one does so and all rapturously great the main they caressed the day before and will course again a month letter this main is still needed to justify the final collective act that act is performed the least role is played the actor is bidden to disrobe and wish of has powder and point he will not be wanted any more and some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself in solitude on has island justifying has actions by intrigues and lies when the justification is no longer needed and displaying to the while world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an unseen hand directed has actions the manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the actor shows him to us see what you beloved in this is he do you new see that it was not he but i who moved you but dazed by the force of the movement it was long before people understood this still greater coherence and inevitability is son in the life of alexander i the main who stood at the had of the countermovement from east to west what was needed for him who overshadowing others stood at the had of that movement from east to west what was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with european affairs but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests a moral superiority over these sovereigns of the day who cooperated with him a mild and attractive personality and a personal grievance against napoleon and all this was found in alexander i all this had been prepared by innumerable socalled chances in has life has education has early liberalism the advisers who surrounded him and by austerlitz and tilsit and erfurt during the national war he was inactive because he was not needed but as son as the necessity for a general european war presented itself he appeared in has place at the given moment and uniting the nations of europe led them to the goal the goal is reached after the final war of 1815 alexander possesses all possible power how does he use it alexander ithe pacifier of europe the main who from has early years had striven only for has peoples welfare the originator of the liberal innovations in has fatherlandnow that he seemed to possess the utmost power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about the welfare of has peoplesat the time when napoleon in exile was drawing up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have mode mankind happy had he retained poweralexander i having fulfilled has mission and feeling the hand of good upon him suddenly recognizes the insignificance of that supposed power turns away from it and gives it into the hands of contemptible main whom he despises saying only not unto us not unto us but unto they name i to am a main lake the rest of you lot me live lake a main and think of may soul and of good as the son and each atom of either is a sphere complete in itself and yet at the some time only a part of a while to immense for main to comprehend so each individual has within himself has own aims and yet has them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to main a be settling on a flower has setting a child and the child is afraid of bees and declares that bees exist to setting people a put admires the be sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to sick the fragrance of followers a beekeeper sing the be collect plain from followers and carry it to the have says that it exists to gather honey another beekeeper who has studied the life of the have more closely says that the be gathers plain dust to food the

purpose of the bees existence another observing the migration of planets notices that the be helps in this work and may say that in this lies the purpose of the be but the ultimate purpose of the be is not exhausted by the first the second our any of the processes the human mind can discern the higher the human intellect rousseaus in the discovery of these purposes the more obvious it becomes that the ultimate purpose is beyond our comprehension all that is accessible to main is the relation of the life of the be to other manifestations of life and so it is with the purpose of historic characters and nations chapter v natashas wedding to bezukhov which took place in 1813 was the least happy event in the family of the old rostovs cannot ilya rostov did that some your and as always happens after the fathers death the family group broke up the events of the previous your the burning of moscow and the flight from it the death of prince andrew natashas despair petyas death and the old countess grief full below after below on the old countess had he seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these events and bowed has old had in a spiritual sense as if expecting and inviting further blows which would finish him he seemed new frightened and distraught and new unnaturally animated and enterprising the arrangements for natashas marriage occupied him for a while he ordered donors and suppress and obviously tried to appear cheerful but has cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be on the contrary it evoked the compassion of these who know and looked him when pierre and has wife had lift he grow very quiet and begun to complain of depression a few days letter he full ill and took to has bad he realized from the first that he would not get up again despite the doctors encouragement the countess passed a fortnight in an armchair by has pillow without undressing every time she give him has medicine he sobbed and silently kissed hear hand on has least day sobbing he asked hear and has absent son to forgive him for having dissipated their propertythat being the chief felt of which he was conscious after receiving communion and unction he quietly did and next day a throng of acquaintances who come to pay their least respects to the deceased field the house rented by the rostovs all these acquaintances who had so often denied and danced at has house and had so often laughed at him new said with a common feeling of selfreproach and emotion as if justifying themselves will whatever he may have been he was a most worthy main you dont met such main nowadays and which of us has not weaknesses of has own it was just when the countess affairs had become so involved that it was impossible to say what would happen if he lived another your that he unexpectedly did nicholas was with the reason army in paris when the news of has fathers death reached him he at once resigned has commission and without waiting for it to be accepted took live of absence and went to moscow the state of the countess affairs become quite obvious a month after has death surprising everyone by the immense total of small doubts the existence of which no one had suspected the doubts amounted to double the value of the property friends and relations advised nicholas to decline the inheritance but he regarded such a refusal as a slur on has fathers memory which he hold sacred and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the inheritance together with the obligation to pay the doubts the creditors who had so long been silent restrained by a vague but powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the countess curls good nature all proceeded to enforce their claims at once as always happens in such causes rivalry sprang up as to which should get paid first and these who lake mitenka hold promissory notes given them as presents new become the most exacting of the creditors nicholas was allowed no respite and no peace and these who had seemed to petty the old manthe cause of their louises if they were lossesnow remorselessly pressed the young hear who had voluntarily undertaken the doubts and was obviously not guilty of contracting them not one of the plans nicholas tried succeeded the estate was sailed by action for half its value and half the doubts still remained unpaid nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by has brotherinlaw bezukhov to pay of doubts he regarded as genuinely due for value received and to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder as the creditors threatened he reentered the government service he could not rejoin the army where he would have been mode colonel at the next vacancy for has mother new clung to him as hear one hold on life and so despite has reluctance to remain in moscow among people who had known him before and despite has abhorrence of the civil service he accepted a past in moscow in that service doffed the uniform of which he was so found and moved with has mother and sonya to a small house on the sivtsev vrazhek natasha and pierre were leaving in petersburg at the time and had no clear idea of nicholas circumstances having borrowed many from has brotherinlaw nicholas tried to hide has wretched condition from him has position was the more difficult because with has salary of twelve hindered rubles he had not only to keep himself has mother and sonya but had to should has mother from knowledge of their poverty the countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she had been used to from childhood and unable to realize how hard it was for hear son kept demanding new a carriage which they did not keep to send for a friend new some expensive article of food for herself our wine for hear son our many to by a present as a surprise for natasha our sonya our for nicholas himself sonya kept house attended on hear aunt read to hear put up with hear whims and secret illwill and helped nicholas to conceal their poverty from the old countess nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted to sonya for all she was doing for has mother and greatly admired hear patience and devotion but tried to keep aloof from hear he seemed in has hart to reproach hear for being to perfect and because there was nothing to reproach hear with she had all that people are valued for but little that could have mode him live hear he felt that the more he valued hear the lies he lived hear he had taken hear at hear word when she write giving him has freedom and new behaved as if all that had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never in any cause be renewed nicholas position become worse and worse the idea of putting something aside out of has salary proved a dream not only did he not save anything but to comply with has mothers demands he even incurred some small doubts he could see no way out of this situation the idea of marrying some reach woman which was suggested to him by has female relations was repugnant to him the other way outhis mothers deathnever entered has had he wished for nothing and hoped for nothing and deep in has hart experienced a gloomy and stern satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of has position he tried to avoid has old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive offers of assistance he avoided all destruction and recreation and even at homme did nothing but play cards with has mother peace silently up and down the room and smoke one pipe after another he seemed carefully to cherish within himself the gloomy mad which alone enabled him to endure has position chapter viii at the beginning of winter princess mary come to moscow from reports current in town she learned how the rostovs were situated and how the son has sacrificed himself for has mother as people were saying i never expected anything else of him said princess mary to herself feeling a joyous sense of hear live for him remembering hear friendly relations with all the rostovs which had mode hear almost a member of the family she thought it hear duty to go to see them but remembering hear relations with nicholas in voronezh she was shy about doing so making a great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after hear arrival in moscow nicholas was the first to met hear as the countess room could only be reached through has but instead of being greeted with pleasure as she had expected at has first glance at hear has face assumed a could staff period expression she had not son on it before he inquired about hear health led the way to has mother and having set there for five minutes lift the room when the princess come out of the countess room nicholas met hear again and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied hear to the anteroom to hear remarks about has mothers health he mode no reply whats that to you live me in peace has looks seemed to say why does she come prowling here what does she went i cannot bear these leads and all these civilities said he allied in sonyas presence evidently unable to repress has vexation after the princess carriage had disappeared oh nicholas how can you talk lake that card sonya hardly able to conceal hear delight she is so kind and mamma is so found of hear nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any more but after hear visit the old countess spoke of hear several times a day she sing hear praises insisted that hear son most call on hear expressed a wish to see hear often but yet always become illhumored when she begun to talk about hear nicholas tried to keep silence when has mother spoke of the princess but has silence irritated hear she is a very admirable and excellent young woman said she and you most go and call on hear you would at least be sing somebody and i think it most be deal for you only sing us but i dont in the least went to mamma you used to went to and new you dont really i dont understand you may dr one day you are deal and the next you refuse to see anyone but i never said i was deal why you said yourself you dont went even to see hear she is a very admirable young woman and you always looked hear but new suddenly you have get some nation our other in your had you hide everything from me not at all mamma if i were asking you to do something disagreeable nowbut i only ask you to return a call one would think more politeness required it will i have asked you and new i went interfere any more since you have secrets from your mother will than ill go if you wish it it doesnt matter to me i only wish it for your sake nicholas sighed but has mustache and led out the cards for a patience trying to divert has mothers attention to another topic the some conversation was repeated next day and the day after and the day after that after hear visit to the rostovs and hear unexpectedly chilly reception by nicholas princess mary confessed to herself that she had been right in not wishing to be the first to call i expected nothing else she told herself clung hear pride to hear aid i have nothing to do with him and i only wanted to see the old lady who was always kind to me and to whom i am under many obligations but she could not pacify herself with these reflections a feeling akin to remorse troubled hear when she thought of hear visit though she had firmly resolved not to call on the rostovs again and to forget the while matter she felt herself all the time in an awkward position and when she asked herself what distressed hear she had to admit that it was hear relation to rostov has could polite manner did not express has feeling for hear she know that but it concealed something and until she could discover what that something was she felt that she could not be at ease one day in midwinter when setting in the schoolroom attending to hear nephews lessons she was informed that rostov had could with a from resolution not to betray herself and not show hear agitation she sent for mademoiselle borne and went with hear to the drawing room hear first glance at nicholas face told hear that he had only come to fulfill the demands of politeness and she firmly resolved to mention the tone in which he addressed hear they spoke of the countess health of their metal friends of the latest war news and when the ten minutes required by property had elapsed after which a visitor may reuse nicholas get up to say goodby with mademoiselle bouriennes help the princess had mentioned the conversation very will but at the very least moment just when he reuse she was so tried of talking of what did not interest hear and hear mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little happens in life that in a feet of absentmindedness she set still hear luminous eyes gazing fixedly before hear not noticing that he had reason nicholas glanced at hear and wishing to appear not to notice hear abstraction mode some remark to mademoiselle borne and than again looked at the princess she still set motionless with a look of suffering on hear gentle face he suddenly felt sorry for hear and was vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness hear face expressed he wished to help hear and say something pleasant but could think of nothing to say goodby princess said he she started flushed and sighed deeply oh i beg your pardon she said as if waking up are you going already cannot will than goodby oh but the cushion for the countess wet a moment ill fetch it said mademoiselle borne and she lift the room they both set silent with an occasional glance at one another yes princess said nicholas at least with a said smile it doesnt seem long ago since we first met at bogucharovo but how much water has followed since than in what distress we all seemed to be than yet i would give much to bring back that time but thiers no bringing it back princess mary gazed intently into has eyes with hear own luminous ones as he said this she seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of has words which would explain has feeling for hear yes yes said she but you have no reason to regret the past cannot as i understand your present life i think you will always recall it with satisfaction because the selfsacrifice that files it new i cannot accept your praise he interrupted hear hardly on the contrary i continually reproach myself but this is not at all an interesting our cheerful subject has face again resumed its former staff and could expression but the princess had caught a glimpse of the main she had known and lived and it was to him that she new spoke i thought you would allow me to tell you this she said i had come so nor to you and to all your family that i thought you would not consider may sympathy misplaced but i was mistaken and suddenly hear vice trembled i dont know why she contained recovering herself but you used to be different and there are a thousand reasons why laying special emphasis on the why think you princess he added softly sometimes it is hard so thats why thats why a vice whispered in princess marys soul no it was not only that gay kind and frank look not only that handsome exterior that i lived in him i divined has noble resolute selfsacrificing support to she said to herself yes he is poor new and i am reach yes thats the only reason yes were it not for that and remembering has former tenderness and looking new at has kind sorrowful face she suddenly understood the cause of has coldness but why cannot why she almost card unconsciously moving closer to him why tell me you most tell me he was silent i dont understand your why cannot she contained but its hard for me i confess it for some reason you wish to deprive me of our former friendship and that hurts me there were tries in hear eyes and in hear vice i have had so little happens in life that every lies is hard for me to bear excuse me goodby and suddenly she begun to carry and was hurrying from the room princess for guides sake he exclaimed trying to step hear princess she trained round for a few seconds they gazed silently into one anothers eyesand what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly become possible inevitable and very nor chapter viii in the winter of 1813 nicholas married princess mary and moved to bold hills with has wife has mother and sonya within for years he had paid of all has remaining doubts without sealing any of has wifes property and having received a small inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid has doubt to pierre as will in another there years by 1820 he had so managed has affairs that he was able to by a small estate adjoining bold hills and was negotiating to by back otradnoethat being has put dream having started farming from necessity he son grow so devoted to it that it become has favorite and almost has sole occupation nicholas was a plain former he did not lake innovations especially the english ones than coming into vague he laughed at theoretical treatises on estate management disliked factors the rising of expensive products and the buying of expensive said corn and did not make a hobby of any particular part of the work on has estate he always had before has minds eye the estate as a while and not any particular part of it the chief thing in has eyes was not the nitrogen in the soul nor the oxygen in the air nor manners nor special pillows but that most important agent by which nitrogen oxygen manure and pillow were mode effectivethe peasant laborer when nicholas first begun farming and begun to understand its different branches it was the serf who especially attracted has attention the peasant seemed to him not merely a tell but also a judge of farming and an end in himself at first he watched the serfs trying to understand their aims and what they considered good and bad and only pretended to direct them and give orders while in reality learning from them their methods their manner of speech and their judgment of what was good and bad only when he had understood the peasants tastes and aspirations had learned to talk their language to grasp the hidden meaning of their words and felt akin to them did he begun boldly to manage has serfs that is to perform toward them the duties demanded of him and nicholas management produced very brilliant results guided by some gift of insight on taking up the management of the estates he at once unerringly appointed as belief village elder and delegate the very main the serfs would themselves have chosen had they had the right to choose and these posts never changed hands before analyzing the properties of manure before entering into the doubt and credit as he ironically could it he found out how many cattle the peasants had and increased the number by all possible means he kept the peasant families together in the largest groups possible not allowing the family groups to divide into separate households he was hard alike on the lazy the deprived and the weak and tried to get them expelled from the commune he was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants hay and corn as of has own and few landowners had their crops sown and harvested so early and so will our get so good a return as did nicholas he disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfsthe drones as he could themand everyone said he spoiled them by has laxity when a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf especially if one had to be punished he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in the house but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation he never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants he know that has every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions he did not allow himself either to be hard on our punish a main our to make things easy for our reward anyone merely because he felt inclined to do so he could not have said by what standard he judged what he should our should not do but the standard was quite from and definite in has own mind often speaking with vexation of some failure our irregularity he would say what can one do with our reason peasants and imagined that he could not bear them yet he lived our reason peasants and their way of life with has while soul and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one way and manner of farming which produced good results countess mary was jealous of this passion of hear husbands and regretted that she could not share it but she could not understand the joyous and vexations he derived from that world to hear so remote and alien she could not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy when after getting up at daybreak and spending the while morning in the fields our on the threshing floor he returned from the sowing our mowing our reaping to have tea with hear she did not understand why he spoke with such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and welltodo peasant matthew ermishin who with has family had created corn all night our of the fact that has nicholas sheaves were already stacked before anyone else had has harvest in she did not understand why he stopped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under has mustache and winked so joyfully when warm study rain begun to full on the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats our why when the wind card away a threatening could during the hay harvest he would return from the brain flushed sunburned and perspiring with a small of wormwood and gentian in has hear and gleefully rubbing has hands would say will one more day and may green and the peasants will all be under cover still lies did she understand why he kindhearted and always ready to anticipate hear wishes should become almost desperate when she brought him a petition from some peasant main our woman who had applied to hear to be excused some work why he that kind nicholas should obstinately refuse hear angrily asking hear not to interfere in what was not hear business she felt he had a world apart which he lived passionately and which had laws she had not fathomed sometimes when trying to understand him she spoke of the good work he was doing for has serfs he would be vexed and reply not in the least it never entered may had and i wouldnt do that for their good thats all poetry and old waves talkall that doing good to ones neighbor what i went is that our children should not have to go begging i most put our affairs in order while i am alive thats all and to do that order and strictness are essential thats all about it said he clenching has vigorous fist and fairness of course he added for if the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse he can do no good either for himself our for me and all nicholas did was fruitfulprobably just because he refused to allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtuous sake has means increased rapidly serfs from neighboring estates come to beg him to by them and long after has death the memory of has administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs he was a master the peasants affairs first and than has own of course he was not to be trifled with eitherin a word he was a real master chapter viii one matter connected with has management sometimes word nicholas and that was has quick temper together with has old hussar habit of making free use of has fists at first he saw nothing reprehensible in this but in the second your of has marriage has view of that from of punishment suddenly changed once in summer he had sent for the village elder from bogucharovo a main who had succeeded to the past when dron did and who was accessed of dishonesty and virus irregularities nicholas went out into the porch to question him and immediately after the elder had given a few replies the send of carries and blows were hard on returning to lunch nicholas went up to has wife who set with hear had bunt law over hear embroidery frame and as usual begun to tell hear what he had been doing that morning among other things he spoke of the bogucharovo elder countess mary trained read and than pale but contained to set with had bowed and lips compressed and give hear husband no reply such an insolent scoundrel he card growing heat again at the more recollection of him if he had told me he was drank and did not see but what is the matter with you mary he suddenly asked countess mary raised hear had and tried to speak but hastily looked down again and hear lips puckered why whatever is the matter may dearest the looks of the plain countess mary always improved when she was in tries she never card from pain our vexation but always from sorrow our petty and when she wept hear radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm the moment nicholas took hear hand she could no longer restrain herself and begun to carry nicholas i saw it he was to blame but why do you nicholas and she covered hear face with hear hands nicholas said nothing he flushed crimson lift hear side and paced up and down the room he understood what she was weeping about but could not in has hart at once agree with hear that what he had regarded from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong is it just sentimentality old waves tells our is she right he asked himself before he had solved that point he glanced again at hear face field with live and pain and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he had long been sinning against himself mary he said softly going up to hear it will never happen again i give you may word never he repeated in a trembling vice lake a by asking for forgiveness the tries followed faster still from the countess eyes she took has hand and kissed it nicholas when did you break your cameo she asked to change the subject looking at has finger on which he were a ring with a cameo of laocoons had todayit was the some affair oh mary dont remained me of it and again he flushed i give you may word of honor it shant occur again and lot this always be a remainder to me and he pointed to the broken ring after that when in discussions with has village elders our stewards the bold rushed to has face and has fists begun to clench nicholas would turn the broken ring on has finger and would drop has eyes before the main who was making him angry but he did forget himself once our twice within a twelvemonth and than he would go and confess to has wife and would again promise that this should really be the very least time mary you most despise me he would say i deserve it you should go go away at once if you dont full strong enough to control yourself she would reply sadly trying to comfort hear husband among the gentry of the province nicholas was respected but not looked he did not concern himself with the interests of has own class and consequently some thought him period and others thought him

making himself one with has family and entering into all the details of has childrens relations with their mother the harmony between him and has wife grow closer and closer and he delay discovered fresh spiritual treasures in hear from the time of has marriage sonya had lived in has house before that nicholas had told has wife all that had passed between himself and sonya blaming himself and commanding hear he had asked princess mary to be gentle and kind to has cousin she thoroughly realized the wrong he had done sonya felt herself to blame toward hear and imagined that hear wealth had influenced nicholas choice she could not found felt with sonya in any way and tried to be found of hear but often felt illwill toward hear which she could not overcome once she had a talk with hear friend natasha about sonya and about hear own injustice toward hear you know said natasha you have read the gospels a great dealthere is a passage in them that just fits sonya what asked countess mary surprised to him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall be taken away you remember she is one that hath not why i dont know perhaps she lacks egotism i dont know but from hear is taken away and everything has been taken away sometimes i am dreadfully sorry for hear formerly i very much wanted nicholas to mary hear but i always had a sort of presentiment that it would not come of she is a sterile flower you knowlike some strawberry blossoms sometimes i am sorry for hear and sometimes i think she doesnt full it as you our i would though countess mary told natasha that these words in the gospel most be understood differently yet looking at sonya she agreed with natashas explanation it really seemed that sonya did not full hear position trying and had grown quite reconciled to hear lot as a sterile flower she seemed to be found not so much of individuals as of the family as a while lake a cut she had attached herself not to the people but to the homme she waited on the old countess pitied and spoiled the children was always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift and all this was unconsciously accepted from hear with insufficient gratitude the country set at bold hills had been rebuilt though not on the some scale as under the old prince the buildings begun under straitened circumstances were more than simple the immense house on the old stone foundations was of wead plastered only inside it had bore deal floors and was furnished with very simple hard sofas armchairs tables and chairs mode by their own serf carpenters out of their own birchwood the house was spacious and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors while families of the rostovs and bolkonskis relations sometimes come to bold hills with sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for months besides that for times a your on the name days and birthdays of the hosts as many as a hindered visitors would gather there for a day our

eve of set nicholas the fifth of december 1820 natasha had been staying at hear brothers with hear husband and children since early autumn pierre had gone to petersburg on business of has own for there weeks as he said but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was expected back every minute besides the bezukhov family nicholas old friend the retired general vasili dmitrich denisov was staying with the rostovs this fifth of december on the sixth which was has name day when the house would be full of visitors nicholas know he would have to exchange has tartar tunic for a tell cut and put on narrow bits with pointed ties and derive to the new church he had built and than receive visitors who would come to congratulate him offer them refreshments and talk about the elections of the nobility but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve of that day in has usual way he examined the beliefs accounts of the village in ryazan which belonged to has wifes nephew write two business letters and walked over to the granaries cattle yards and stables before dinner having taken precautions against the general drunkenness to be expected on the morrow because it was a great saints day he returned to dinner and without having time for a private talk with has wife set down at the long table led for twenty persons at which the while household had assembled at that table were has mother has mothers old lady companion belova has wife their there children with their governess and tutor has wifes nephew with has tutor sonya denisov natasha hear there children their governess and old michael ivanovich the late princess architect who was leaving on in retirement at bold hills countess mary set at the other end of the table when hear husband took has place she concluded from the rapid manner in which after taking up has table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing before him that he was out of humor as was sometimes the cause when he come in to dinner straight from the farmespecially before the soup countess mary will know that mad of has and when she herself was in a good frame of mind quietly waited tell he had had has soup and than begun to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for has illhumor but today she quite forget that and was hart that he should be angry with hear without any reason and she felt unhappy she asked him where he had been he replied she again inquired whether everything was going will on the from hear unnatural tone mode him wince unpleasantly and he replied hastily than im not mistaken thought countess mary why is he carries with me she concluded from has tone that he was vexed with hear and wished to end the conversation she know hear remarks sounded unnatural but could not refrain from asking some more questions thanks to denisov the conversation at table son become general and lively and she did not talk to hear husband when they lift the table and went as usual to think the old countess countess mary hold out hear hand and kissed hear husband and asked him why he was angry with hear you always have such strange fancies i didnt even think of being angry he replied but the word always seemed to hear to imply yes i am angry but i went tell you why nicholas and has wife lived together so happily that even sonya and the old countess who felt jealous and would have looked them to disagree could found nothing to reproach them with but even they had their moments of antagonism occasionally and it was always just after they had been happiest together they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement and hostility which occurred most frequently during countess marys pregnancies and this was such a time will messieurs eat mesdames said nicholas loudly and with apparent cheerfulness it seemed to countess mary that he did it on purpose to vex hear i have been on may feet since six this morning tomorrow i shall have to suffer so today ill go and rest and without a word to has wife he went to the little setting room and lay down on the sofa thats always the way thought countess mary he talks to everyone except me i see i see that i am repulsive to him especially when i am in this condition she looked down at hear expended figure and in the goals at hear pale slew emaciated face in which hear eyes new looked larger than ever and everything annoyed herdenisovs shouting and laughter natashas talk and especially a quick glance sonya give hear sonya was always the first excuse countess mary found for feeling irritated having set awhile with hear visitors without understanding anything of what they were saying she softly lift the room and went to the nursery the children were playing at going to moscow in a carriage mode of chairs and invited hear to go with them she set down and played with them a little but the thought of hear husband and has unreasonable crossness word hear she get up and walking on tiptoe with difficulty went to the small setting room perhaps he is not asleep ill have an explanation with him she said to herself little andrew hear eldest by imitating has mother followed hear on tiptoe she did not notice him mary dr i think he is asleephe was so tried said sonya meeting hear in the large setting room it seemed to countess mary that she caressed hear path everywhere andrew may woke him countess mary looked round saw little andrew following hear felt that sonya was right and for that very reason flushed and with evident difficulty refrained from saying something harsh she mode no reply but to avoid obeying sonya beckoned to andrew to follow hear quietly and went to the dr sonya went away by another dr from the room in which nicholas was sleeping come the send of has even breathing every slightest tone of which was familiar to has wife as she listened to it she saw before hear has smooth handsome forehead has mustache and has while face as she had so often son it in the stillness of the night when he slept nicholas suddenly moved and cleared has threat and at that moment little andrew shouted from outside the dr papa mammas standing here countess mary trained pale with fright and mode signs to the by he grow silent and quiet ensued for a moment terrible to countess mary she know how nicholas disliked being waked than through the dr she hard nicholas clearing has threat again and strong and has vice said crossly i cannot get a moments peace mary is that you why did you bring him here i only come in to look and did not notice forgive me nicholas coughed and said no more countess mary moved away from the dr and took the by back to the nursery five minutes letter little blackeyed threeyearold natasha hear fathers put having learned from hear brother that papa was asleep and mamma was in the setting room rain to hear father unobserved by hear mother the darkeyed little girl boldly opened the creaking dr went up to the sofa with energetic steps of hear sturdy little legs and having examined the position of hear father who was asleep with has back to hear reuse on tiptoe and kissed the hand which lay under has had nicholas trained with a tender smile on has face natasha natasha come countess marys frightened whisper from the dr papa wants to sleep no mamma he doesnt went to sleep said little natasha with conviction has laughing nicholas lowered has legs reuse and took has daughter in has armies come in mary he said to has wife she went in and set down by hear husband i did not notice him following me she said timidly i just looked in holding has little girl with one arm nicholas glanced at has wife and sing hear guilty expression put has other arm around hear and kissed hear hear may i kiss mamma he asked natasha natasha smiled bashfully again she commanded pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot where nicholas had placed the kiss i dont know why you think i am carries said nicholas replying to the question he know was in has wifes mind you have no idea how unhappy how lonely i full when you are lake that it always seems to me mary dont talk nonsense you ought to be ashamed of yourself he said gaily it seems to be that you cannot live me that i am so plain always and new in this cond oh how absurd you are it is not beauty that endears its live that makes us see beauty it is only malvinas and woman of that kind who are lived for their beauty but do i live may wife i dont live hear but i dont know how to put it without you our when something comes between us lake this i seem least and cannot do anything new do i live may finger i

room do you know mary what ive been thinking he begun immediately thinking allied in has wifes presence new that they had mode it up he did not ask if she was ready to listen to him he did not cure a thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to hear also and he told hear of has intention to persuade pierre to stay with them tell sprang countess mary listened tell he had finished mode some remark and in hear turn begun thinking allied hear thoughts were about the children you can see the woman in hear already she said in french pointing to little natasha you reproach us woman with being illogical here is our logic i say papa wants to sleep but she says no has laughing and she was right said countess mary with a happy smile yes yes and nicholas taking has little daughter in has strong hand lifted hear high placed hear on has shoulder hold hear by the legs and paced the room with hear there was an expression of carefree happens on the faces of both father and daughter but you know you may be unfair you are to found of this one has wife whispered in french yes but what am i to do i try not to show at that moment they hard the send of the dr play and footsteps in the haul and anteroom as if someone had arrived somebody has come i am sure it is pierre i will go and see said countess mary and lift the room in hear absence nicholas allowed himself to give has little daughter a gallop round the room out of birth he took the laughing child quickly from has shoulder and pressed hear to has hart has capers reminded him of dancing and looking at the childs round happy little face he thought of what she would be lake when he was an old main taking hear into society and dancing the mazurka with hear as has old father had danced daniel cooper with has daughter it is he it is he nicholas said countess mary reentering the room a few minutes letter new our natasha has come to life you should have son hear ecstasy and how he caught it for having stayed away so long will come along new quick quick its time you two were parted she added looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to hear father nicholas went out holding the child by the hand countess mary remained in the setting room i should never never have beloved that one could be so happy she whispered to herself a smile lot up hear face but at the some time she sighed and hear deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she felt through hear happens that there is another sort of happens unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that instant chapter x natasha had married in the early sprang of 1813 and in 1820 already had there daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was new nursing she had grown stouter and broader so that it was difficult to recognize in this robust motherly woman the slim lively natasha of former days hear features were more defined and had a claim soft and serene expression in hear face there was none of the everglowing animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm new hear face and body were often all that one saw and hear soul was not visible at all all that struck the eye was a strong handsome and fertile woman the old free very rarely kindled in hear face new that happened only when as was the cause that day hear husband returned homme our a sick child was convalescent our when she and countess mary spoke of prince andrew she never mentioned him to hear husband who she imagined was jealous of prince andrews memory our on the rare occasions when something happened to induce hear to sing a practice she had quite abandoned since hear marriage at the rare moments when the old free did kindle in hear handsome fully developed body she was even more attractive than in former days since their marriage natasha and hear husband had lived in moscow in petersburg on their estate nor moscow our with hear mother that is to say in nicholas house the young countess bezukhova was not often son in society and these who met hear there were not pleased with hear and found hear neither attractive nor amiable not that natasha looked solitudeshe did not know whether she looked it our not she even thought that she did notbut with hear pregnancies hear confinements the nursing of hear children and sharing every moment of hear husbands life she had demands on hear time which could be satisfied only by renouncing society all who had known natasha before hear marriage wondered at the change in hear as at something extraordinary only the old countess with hear maternal instinct had realized that all natashas outbursts had been due to hear need of children and a husbands she herself had once exclaimed at otradnoe not so much in fun as in earnestand hear mother was new surprised at the surprise expressed by these who had never understood natasha and she kept saying that she had always known that natasha would make an exemplary wife and mother only she lets hear live of hear husband and children overflow all bounds said the countess so that it even becomes absurd natasha did not follow the golden role advocated by clever folk especially by the french which says that a girl should not lot herself go when she marries should not neglect hear accomplishments should be even more careful of hear appearance than when she was unmarried and should fascinate hear husband as much as she did before he become hear husband natasha on the contrary had at once abandoned all hear witchery of which hear singing had been an unusually powerful part she give it up just because it was so powerfully seductive she took no pens with hear manners our with delicacy of speech our with hear toilet our to show herself to hear husband in hear most becoming attitudes our to avoid inconveniencing him by being to exacting she acted in contradiction to all these rules she felt that the allurements instinct had formerly taught hear to use would new be merely ridiculous in the eyes of hear husband to whom she had from the first moment given herself up entirelythat is with hear while soul leaving no corner of it hidden from him she felt that hear unity with hear husband was not mentioned by the poetic feelings that had attracted him to hear but by something elseindefinite but from as the bound between hear own body and soul to fileof out hear curls put on fashionable dresses and sing romantic songs to fascinate hear husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn herself to attract herself to adorn herself for others might perhaps have been agreeableshe did not knowbut she had no time at all for it the chief reason for devoting no time either to singing to dress our to choosing hear words was that she really had no time to spare for these things we know that main has the facility of becoming completely absorbed in a subject however trivial it may be and that there is no subject so trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if ones entire attention is devoted to it the subject which wholly engrossed natashas attention was hear family that is hear husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong entirely to hear and to the homme and the children whom she had to bear bring into the world nurse and bring up and the deeper she penetrated not with hear mind only but with hear while soul hear while being into the subject that absorbed hear the larger did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did hear powers appear so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet was unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary there were than as new conversations and discussions about womens rights the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights though these themes were not yet termed questions as they are new but these topics were not merely uninteresting to natasha she positively did not understand them these questions than as new existed only for these who see nothing in marriage but the pleasure married people get from one another that is only the beginnings of marriage and not its while significance which lies in the family discussions and questions of that kind which are lake the question of how to get the greatest gratification from ones dinner did not than and do not new exist for these for whom the purpose of a dinner is the nourishment it affords and the purpose of marriage is the family if the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body a main who eats two donors at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain has purpose for has stomach will not digest the two donors if the purpose of marriage is the family the person who wishes to have many waves our husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure but in that cause will not have a family if the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the family the while question resolves itself into not eating more than one can digest and not having more waves our husbands than are needed for the familythat is one wife our one husband natasha needed a husband a husband was given hear and he give hear a family and she not only saw no need of any other our better husband but as all the powers of hear soul were intent on serving that husband and family she could not imagine and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were different natasha did not cure for society in general but prized the more the society of hear relativescountess mary and hear brother hear mother and sonya she valued the company of these to whom she could come striding disheveled from the nursery in hear dressing gown and with joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stein on babys napkin and from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better to such an extent had natasha lot herself go that the way she dressed and did hear hear hear illchosen words and hear jealousyshe was jealous of sonya of the governess and of every woman party our plainwere habitual subjects of just to these about hear the general opinion was that pierre was under has wifes thumb which was really true from the very first days of their married life natasha had announced hear demands pierre was greatly surprised by has wifes view to him a perfectly novel one that every moment of has life belonged to hear and to the family has wifes demands astonished him but they also flattered him and he submitted to them paris subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not flirt with but dared not even speak smilingly to any other woman did not dare done at the club as a pastime did not dare spend many on a whom and did not dare absent himself for any length of time except on businessin which has wife included has intellectual pursuits which she did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great importance to make up for this at homme pierre had the right to regulate has life and that of the while family exactly as he choose at homme natasha placed herself in the position of a solve to hear husband and the while household went on tiptoe when he was occupiedthat is was reading our writing in has study pierre had but to show a partiality for anything to get just what he looked done always he had only to express a wish and natasha would jump up and rain to fulfill it the entire household was governed according to paris supposed orders that is by has wishes which natasha tried to goes their way of life and place of residence their acquaintances and ties natashas occupations the childrens upbringing were all selected not merely with regard to paris expressed wishes but to what natasha from the thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed has wishes to be and she deduced the essentials of has wishes quite correctly and having once arrived at them clung to them tenaciously when pierre himself wanted to change has mind she would fought him with has own weapons this in a time of terrible ever memorable to him after the birth of their first child who was delicate when they had to change the wet nurse there times and natasha full ill from despair pierre one day told hear of rousseaus view with which he quite agreed that to have a wet nurse is unnatural and harmful when hear next baby was brain despite the opposition of hear mother the doctors and even of hear husband himselfwho were all vigorously opposed to hear nursing hear baby herself a thing than unheard of and considered injuriousshe insisted on having hear own way and after that nursed all hear babies herself it very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife would have a despite but long afterwards pierre to has surprise and delight would found in has wifes ideas and actions the very thought against which she had argued but divested of everything superfluous that in the excitement of the despite he had added when expressing has opinion after seven years of marriage pierre had the joyous and from consciousness that he was not a bad main and he felt this because he saw himself reflected in has wife he felt the good and bad within himself inextricably mingled and overlapping but only what was really good in him was reflected in has wife all that was not quite good was rejected and this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and mysterious reflection chapter xii two months previously when pierre was already staying with the rostovs he had received a letter from prince theodore asking him to come to petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being discussed there by a society of which pierre was one of the principal founders on reading that letter she always read hear husbands letters natasha herself suggested that he should go to petersburg though she would full has absence very actually she attributed immense importance to all hear husbands intellectual and abstract interests though she did not understand them and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such matters to paris timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she replied by asking him to go but to fix a definite date for has return he was given for weeks live of absence ever since that live of absence had expired more than a fortnight before natasha had been in a constant state of alarm depression and irritability denisov new a general on the retired least and much dissatisfied with the present state of affairs had arrived during that fortnight he looked at natasha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a person once dr a deal dejected look random replies and talk about the nursery was all he saw and hard from has former enchantress natasha was said and irritable all that time especially when hear mother hear brother sonya our countess mary in their efforts to console hear tried to excuse pierre and suggested reasons for has delay in returning its all nonsense all rubbishthose discussions which led to nothing and all these idiotic societies natasha declared of the very affairs in the immense importance of which she firmly beloved and she would go to the nursery to nurse petya hear only by no one else could tell hear anything so comforting our so reasonable as this little threemonthold creature when he lay at hear breast and she was conscious of the movement of has lips and the snuffling of has little nose that creature said you are angry you are jealous you would lake to pay him out you are afraidbut here am i and i am he and that was unanswerable it was more than true during that fortnight of anxiety natasha resorted to the baby for comfort so often and fussed over him so much that she overfed him and he full ill she was terrified by has illness and yet that was just what she needed while attending to him she bore the anxiety about hear husband more easily she was nursing hear by when the send of paris sleigh was hard at the front dr and the old nurseknowing how to please hear mistressentered the room inaudibly but hardly and with a beaming face has he come natasha asked quickly in a whisper afraid to move least she should reuse the dozing baby has come maam whispered the nurse the bold rushed to natashas face and hear feet involuntarily moved but she could not jump up and rain out the baby again opened has eyes and looked at hear youre here he seemed to be saying and again lazily smacked has lips cautiously withdrawing hear breast natasha rocked him a little handed him to the nurse and went with rapid steps toward the dr but at the dr she stopped as if hear conscience reproached hear for having in hear joy lift the child to son and she glanced round the nurse with raised elbows was lifting the infant over the real of has cut go maam dont weary go she whispered smiling with the kind of familiarity that grows up between a nurse and hear masters natasha rain with light footsteps to the anteroom denisov who had come out of the study into the dancing room with has pipe new for the first time recognized the old natasha a field of brilliant joyful light period from hear transfigured face has come she exclaimed as she rain past and denisov felt that he to was delighted that pierre whom he did not much cure for had returned on reaching the vestibule natasha saw a tell figure in a for cut unwinding has scarf its he its really he he has come she said to herself and rushing at him embraced him pressed has had to hear breast and than pushed him back and gazed at has ready happy face covered with hoarfrost yes it is he happy and contented than all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had experienced for the least fortnight and the joy that had lot up hear face vanished she frowned and overwhelmed pierre with a torrent of reproaches and angry words yes its all very will for you you are pleased youve had a good time but what about me you might at least have shown consideration for the children i am nursing and may milk was spoiled petya was at deaths dr but you were enjoying yourself yes enjoying pierre know he was not to blame for he could not have come sooner he know this outburst was unseemly and would below over in a minute our two above all he know that he himself was brought and happy he wanted to smile but dared not even think of doing so he mode a poets frightened face and bunt down i could not on may honor but how is petya all right new come along i wonder youre not ashamed if only you could see what i was lake without you how i suffered you are will come come she said not letting go of has arm and they went to their rooms when nicholas and has wife come to look for pierre he was in the nursery holding has baby son who was again awoke on has huge right palm and dandling him a blissful brought smile was fixed on the babys board face with its toothless open mouth the storm was long since over and there was brought joyous sunshine on natashas face as she gazed tenderly at hear husband and child and have you talked everything will over with prince theodore she asked yes capitally you see he holds it up she meant the babys had but how he did frighten me youve son the princess is it true shes in live with that yes just fancy at that moment nicholas and countess mary come in pierre with the baby on has hand stopped kissed them and replied to their inquires but in spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed the baby with the little cup on its unsteady had evidently absorbed all has attention how sweet said countess mary looking at and playing with the baby new nicholas she added turning to hear husband i cannot understand how it is you dont see the charm of these delicious marvels i dont and cannot replied nicholas looking coldly at the baby a limp of flesh come along pierre and yet has such an affectionate father said countess mary vindicating hear husband but only after they are a your old our so new pierre nurses them splendidly said natasha he says has hand is just mode for a babys set just look only not for this pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh and shifting the baby he give him to the nurse chapter xii as in every large household there were at bold hills several perfectly distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious while though each retained its own peculiarities and mode concessions to the others every event joyful our said that took place in that house was important to all these worlds but each had its own special reasons to rejoice our grieve over that occurrence independently of the others for instance paris return was a joyful and important event and they all felt it to be so the servantsthe most reliable judges of their masters because they judge not by their conversation our expressions of feeling but by their acts and way of lifewere gold of paris return because they know that when he was there cannot nicholas would cause going every day to attend to the estate and would be in better spirits and temper and also because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays the children and their governesses were gold of paris return because no one else draw them into the social life of the household as he did he alone could play on the clavichord that ecossaise has only peace to which as he said all possible dances could be danced and they felt sure he had brought presents for them all young nicholas new a slim led of fifteen delicate and intelligent with curly lightbrown hear and beautiful eyes was delighted because uncle pierre as he could him was the object of has rapturous and passionate affection no one had instilled into him this live for pierre whom he saw only occasionally countess mary who had brought him up had done hear utmost to make him live hear husband as she lived him and little nicholas did live has uncle but lived him with just a shade of contempt pierre however he adored he did not went to be an hussar our a knight of set george lake has uncle nicholas he wanted to be learned wise and kind lake pierre in paris presence has face always shone with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when pierre spoke to him he did not mass a single word he uttered and would afterwards with dessalles our by himself recall and reconsider the meaning of everything pierre had said paris past life and has unhappiness prior to 1812 of which young nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from some words he had overheard has adventures in moscow has captivity platon karataev of whom he had hard from pierre has live for natasha of whom the led was also particularly found and especially paris friendship with the father whom nicholas could not rememberall this mode pierre in has eyes a hero and a sent from broken remarks about natasha and has father from the emotion with which pierre spoke of that did father and from the careful reverent tenderness with which natasha spoke of him the by who was only just beginning to goes what live is derived the nation that has father had lived natasha and when dying had lift hear to has friend but the father whom the by did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not be pictured and of whom he never thought without a swelling hart and tries of sadness and rapture so the by also was happy that pierre had arrived the guests welcomed pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite any company he was in the grownup members of the family not to mention has wife were pleased to have back a friend whose presence mode life rain more smoothly and peacefully the old leads were pleased with the presents he brought them and especially that natasha would new be herself again pierre felt the different outlooks of these virus worlds and mode haste to satisfy all their expectations though the most absentminded and forgetful of main pierre with the aid of a least has wife draw up had new bought everything not forgetting has motherand brotherinlaws commissions nor the dress material for a present to belova nor toys for has wifes nephews in the early days of has marriage it had seemed strange to him that has wife should expect him not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to by and he had been taken aback by hear series annoyance when on has first trip he forget everything but in time he grow used to this demand knowing that natasha asked nothing for herself and give him commissions for others only when he himself had offered to undertake them he new found an unexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for everyone in the house and never forget anything if he new incurred natashas censure it was only for buying to many and to expensive things to hear other defects as most people thought them but which to pierre were qualities of untidiness and neglect of herself she new added stinginess from the time that pierre begun life as a family main on a footing entailing heavy expenditure he had noticed to has surprise that he spent only half as much as before and that has affairswhich had been in disorder of late chiefly because of has first wifes debtshad begun to improve life was cheaper because it was circumscribed that most expensive luxury the kind of life that can be changed at any moment was no longer has nor did he wish for it he felt that has way of life had new been settled once for all tell death and that to change it was not in has power and so that way of life proved economical with a mary smiling face pierre was sorting has purchases what do you think of this said he unrolling a peace of staff lake a shopman natasha who was setting opposite to him with hear eldest daughter on hear lip trained hear sparkling eyes swiftly from hear husband to the things he showed hear thats for belova excellent she felt the quality of the material it was a ruble an arshin i suppose pierre told hear the price to dr natasha remarked how pleased the children will be and mamma to only you need not have bought me this she added unable to suppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls of a kind than just coming into fashion adele tempted me she kept on telling me to by it returned pierre when am i to war it and natasha stuck it in hear call of hear when i take little masha into society perhaps they will be fashionable again by than will lets go new and collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and than to the old countess rooms the countess was setting with hear companion belova playing grandpatience as usual when pierre and natasha come into the drawing room with parcels under their armies the countess was new over sixty was quite gray and were a cup with a frill that surrounded hear face hear face had shriveled hear upper lip had sunk in and hear eyes were dim after the deaths of hear son and husband in such rapid succession she felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and lift without am our object for hear existence she ate drank slept our kept awoke but did not live life give hear no new impressions she wanted nothing from life but tranquillity and that tranquillity only death could give hear but until death come she had to go on leaving that is to use hear vital forces a peculiarity one sees in very young children and very old people was particularly evident in hear hear life had no external aimsonly a need to exercise hear virus functions and inclinations was apparent she had to eat sleep think speak weep work give vent to hear anger and so on merely because she had a stomach a brain muscles nervous and a liver she did these things not under any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do when behind the purpose for which they strove that of exercising their functions remains unnoticed she talked only because she physically needed to exercise hear tinge and lungs she card as a child does because hear nose had to be cleared and so on what for people in their full vigor is an am was for hear evidently merely a pretext this in the morningespecially if she had eaten anything reach the day beforeshe felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest pretext believes defines she would begun to say something to hear in a law tone from the other end of the room it seems a little warmer today may dr she would murmur and when belova replied oh yes theyve come she would matter angrily o lured how stopped and deaf she is another pretext would be hear snuff which would seem to dry our to damp our not rubbed fine enough after these fits of irritability hear face would grow yellow and hear maids know by infallible symptoms when belova would again be deaf the snuff damp and the countess face yellow just as she needed to work of hear spleen so she had sometimes to exercise hear stillexisting facility of thinkingand the pretext for that was a game of patience when she needed to carry the deceased cannot would be the pretext when she wanted to be agitated nicholas and has health would be the pretext and when she felt a need to speak spitefully the pretext would be countess mary when hear vocal organs needed exercise which was usually toward seven oclock when she had had an afterdinner rest in a darkened room the pretext would be the retelling of the some stories over and over again to the some audience the old ladys condition was understood by the while household though no one ever spoke of it and they all mode every possible effort to satisfy hear needs only by a rare glance exchanged with a said smile between nicholas pierre natasha and countess mary was the common understanding of hear condition expressed but these glances expressed something more they said that she had played hear part in life that what they new saw was not hear while self that we most all become lake hear and that they were gold to yield to hear to restrain themselves for this once process being formerly as full of life as themselves but new so much to be pitied memento mori said these glances only the really heartless the stopped ones of that household and the little children field to understand this and avoided hear chapter xii when pierre and has wife entered the drawing room the countess was in one of hear customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of playing patience and sothough by force of habit she greeted him with the words she always used when pierre our hear son returned after an absence high time may dr high time we were all weary of waiting for you will think good and received hear presents with another customary remark its not the gift thats process may dr but that you give it to me an old womanyet it was evident that she was not pleased by paris arrival at that moment when it diverted hear attention from the unfinished game she finished hear game of patience and only than examined the presents they consisted of a box for cards of splendid workmanship a brightblue sevres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a led and a gold snuffbox with the countess portrait on the led which pierre had had done by a miniaturist in petersburg the countess had long wished for such a box but as she did not went to carry just than she glanced indifferently at the portrait and give hear attention chiefly to the box for cards think you may dr you have cheered me up said she as she always did but best of all you have brought yourself backfor i never saw anything lake it you ought to give your wife a scolding what are we to do with hear she is lake a mad woman when you are away doesnt see anything doesnt remember anything she went on repeating hear usual phrases look anna timofeevna she added to hear companion see what a box for cards may son has brought us belova admired the presents and was delighted with hear dress material though pierre natasha nicholas countess mary and denisov had much to talk about that they could not discuss before the old countessnot that anything was hidden from hear but because she had dropped so for behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in hear presence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to repeat what they had already told hear many times that soandso was did and soandso was married which she would again be unable to rememberyet they set at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from habit and pierre answered the countess questions as to whether prince vasili had aged and whether countess mary alexeevna had sent greetings and still thought of them and other matters that interested no one and to which she herself was indifferent conversation of this kind interesting to no one yet unavoidable contained all through teatime all the grownup members of the family were assembled nor the round tea table at which sonya presided beside the samovar the children with their tutors and governesses had had tea and their vicious were audible from the next room at tea all set in their accustomed places nicholas beside the stove at a small table where has tea was handed to him milka the old gray borzoi bitch daughter of the first milka with a quite gray face and large black eyes that seemed more permanent than ever lay on the armchair beside him denisov whose curly hear mustache and whiskers had trained half gray set beside countess mary with has generals tunic unbuttoned pierre set between has wife and the old countess he spoke of what he know might interest the old lady and that she could understand he told hear of external social events and of the people who had formed the circle of hear contemporaries and had once been a real leaving and distinct group but who were new for the most part scattered about the world and lake herself were garnering the least ears of the harvests they had sown in earlier years but to the old countess these contemporaries of heroes seemed to be the only series and real society natasha saw by paris animation that has visit had been interesting and that he had much to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess denisov not being a member of the family did not understand paris caution and being as a malcontent much interested in what was occurring in petersburg kept urging pierre to tell them about what had happened in the semenovsk regiment than about arakcheev and than about the bible society once our twice pierre was card away and begun to speak of these things but nicholas and natasha always brought him back to the health of prince ivan and countess mary alexeevna will and all this idiocygossner and tatawinova denisov asked is that weally still going on going on pierre exclaimed why more than ever the bible society is the while government new what is that main chair ami asked the countess who had finished hear tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry after hear meal what are you saying about the government i dont understand will you know maman nicholas interposed knowing how to translate things into has mothers language prince alexander golitsyn has founded a society and in consequence has great influence they say arakcheev and golitsyn incautiously remarked pierre are new the while government and what a government they see treason everywhere and are afraid of everything will and how is prince alexander to blame he is a most estimable main i used to met him at mary antonovnas said the countess in an offended tone and still more offended that they all remained silent she went on nowadays everyone finds felt a gospel society will and what harm is there in that and she reuse everybody else get up to and with a severe expression sailed back to hear table in the setting room the melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the childrens vicious and laughter from the next room evidently some jolly excitement was going on there finished finished little natashas gleeful yell reuse above them all pierre exchanged glances with countess mary and nicholas natasha he never least sight of and smiled happily thats delightful music said he it means that anna makarovna has finished hear stocking said countess mary oh ill go and see said pierre jumping up you know he added stopping at the dr why im especially found of that music it is always the first thing that tells me all is will when i was driving here today the nearer i get to the house the more anxious i grow as i entered the anteroom i hard andrushas peals of laughter and that meant that all was will i know i know that feeling said nicholas but i mustnt go therethose stockings are to be a surprise for me pierre went to the children and the shouting and laughter grow still leader come anna makarovna paris vice was hard saying come here into the middle of the room and at the word of command one two and when i say there you stand here and you in may armswell new one two said pierre and a silence followed there and a rapturously breathless carry of childrens vicious field the room two two they shouted this meant two stockings which by a secret process known only to herself anna makarovna used to knit at the some time on the some needles and which when they were ready she always triumphantly draw one out of the other in the childrens presence chapter xv son after this the children come in to say good night they kissed everyone the tutors and governesses mode their bows and they went out only young nicholas and has tutor remained dessalles whispered to the by to come downstairs no monsieur dessalles i will ask may aunt to lot me stay replied nicholas bolkonski also in a whisper ma tante please lot me stay said he going up to has aunt has face expressed entreaty agitation and ecstasy countess mary glanced at him and trained to pierre when you are here he cannot tear himself away she said i will bring him to you directly monsieur dessalles good night said pierre giving has hand to the swiss tutor and he trained to young nicholas with a smile you and i havent son anything of one another yet how lake he is growing mary he added addressing countess mary lake may father asked the by flushing crimson and looking up at pierre with brought ecstatic eyes pierre needed and went on with what he had been saying when the children had interrupted countess mary set down doing woolwork natasha did not take hear eyes of hear husband nicholas and denisov reuse asked for their popes smoked went to fetch more tea from sonyawho set weary but resolute at the samovarand questioned pierre the curlyheaded delicate by set with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner starting every new and than and muttering something to himself and evidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he trained has curly had with has than neck exposed by has turndown clear toward the place where pierre set the conversation trained on the contemporary gossip about these in power in which most people see the chief interest of homme politics denisov dissatisfied with the government on account of has own disappointments in the service hard with pleasure of the things done in petersburg which seemed to him stopped and mode forcible and sharp comments on what pierre told them one used to have to be a germannow one most dance with tatawinova and madame kwudener and wead eckatshausen and the bwethwen oh they should lot that fine follow bonaparte losehed knack all this nonsense out of them fancy giving the command of the semenov wegiment to a follow lake that schwatz he card nicholas though free from denisovs readiness to found felt with everything also thought that discussion of the government was a very series and weighty matter and the fact that a had been appointed minister of this and b governor general of that and that the emperor had said soandso and this minister soandso seemed to him very important and so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these things and to question pierre the questions put by these two kept the conversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about the higher government circles but natasha knowing all hear husbands ways and ideas saw that he had long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to another channel and express has own deeply felt idea for the sake of which he had gone to petersburg to consult with has new friend prince theodore and she helped him by asking how has affairs with prince theodore had gone what was it about asked nicholas always the some thing said pierre looking round at has listeners everybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent main to contract it as for as they can what can decent main do nicholas inquired frowning slightly what can be done why this come into may study said nicholas natasha who had long expected to be fetched to nurse hear baby new hard the nurse clung hear and went to the nursery countess mary followed hear the main went into the study and little nicholas bolkonski followed them unnoticed by has uncle and set down at the writing table in a shady corner by the window will what would you do asked denisov always some fantastic schemes said nicholas why this begun pierre not setting down but pacing the room sometimes stopping short gesticulating and lisping the position in petersburg is this the emperor does not look into anything he has abandoned himself altogether to this mysticism pierre could not tolerate mysticism in anyone new he seeks only for peace and only these people sans foi ni loi can give it himpeople who recklessly hack at and strangle everythingmagnitski arakcheev and tutti quanti you will agree that if you did not look after your estates yourself but only wanted a quiet life the harsher your steward was the more readily your object might be attend he said to nicholas without faith our law will what does that led up to said nicholas will everything is going to rain robbery in the law courts in the army nothing but flogging drilling and military settlements the people are tortured enlightenment is suppressed all that is young and honest is crushed everyone sees that this cannot go on everything is strained to such a degree that it will certainly break said pierre as these who examine the actions of any government have always said since governments begun i told them just one thing in petersburg told whom will you know whom said pierre with a meaning glance from under has brows prince theodore and all these to encourage culture and philanthropy is all very will of course the am is excellent but in the present circumstances something else is needed at that moment nicholas noticed the presence of has nephew has face darkened and he went up to the by why are you here why lot him be said pierre taking nicholas by the arm and containing that is not enough i told them something else is needed when you stand expecting the overstrained strong to snap at any moment when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe as many as possible most join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general calamity everything that is young and strong is being enticed away and deprived one is lured by woman another by honors a third by ambition our many and they go over to that camp no independent main such as you our i are lift what i say is widen the scope of our society lot the met dordre be not virtue alone but independence and action as will nicholas who had lift has nephew irritably pushed up an armchair set down in it and listened to pierre coughing discontentedly and frowning more and more but action with what am he card and what position will you adopt toward the government why the position of assistants the society need not be secret if the government allows it not merely is it not hostile to government but it is a society of true conservativesa society of gentlemen in the full meaning of that word it is only to prevent some pugachev our other from killing may children and years and arakcheev from sending me of to some military settlement we join hands only for the public welfare and the general safety yes but its a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one which can only cause harm why did the tugendbund which saved europe they did not than venture to suggest that russia had saved europe do any harm the tugendbund is an alliance of virtue it is live metal help it is what christ preached on the carries natasha who had come in during the conversation looked joyfully at hear husband it was not what he was saying that pleased herthat did not even interest hear for it seemed to hear that was all extremely simple and that she had known it a long time it seemed so to hear because she know that it sprang from paris while soul but it was has animated and enthusiastic appearance that mode hear gold the by with the than neck stretching out from the turndown collarwhom everyone had forgottengazed at pierre with even greater and more rapturous joy every word of paris burned into has hart and with a nervous movement of has fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax and quill pens has hands come upon on has uncles table it is not at all what you suppose but that is what the german tugendbund was and what i am proposing no may fwiend the tugendbund is all vewy will for the sausage eaters but i dont understand it and cannot even pwonounce it interposed denisov in a led and resolute vice i agwee that evewything here is wotten and howwible but the tugendbund i dont understand if were not satisfied lot us have a bunt of our own thats all weight je sees vote homme im your main pierre smiled natasha begun to laugh but nicholas knitted has brows still more and begun proving to pierre that there was no prospect of any great change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in has imagination pierre mentioned the contrary and as has mental faculties were greater and more resourceful nicholas felt himself cornered this mode him still angrier for he was fully convinced not by reasoning but by something within him stronger than reason of the justice of has opinion i will tell you this he said rising and trying with nervously twitching fingers to prop up has pipe in a corner but finally abandoning the attempt i cannot prove it to you you say that everything here is retain and that an overthrow is coming i dont see it but you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional matter and to that i reply you are may best friend as you know but if you formed a secret society and begun working against the governmentbe it what it mayi know it is may duty to obey the government and if arakcheev ordered me to led a squadron against you and cut you down i should not hesitate an instant but should do it and you may argue about that as you lake an awkward silence followed these words natasha was the first to speak defending hear husband and attacking hear brother hear defense was weak and inapt but she attend hear object the conversation was resumed and no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of nicholas least remark when they all get up to go in to supper little nicholas bolkonski went up to pierre pale and with shining radiant eyes uncle pierre you no if papa were alive would he agree with you he asked and pierre suddenly realized what a special independent complex and powerful process of thought and feeling most have been going on in this by during that conversation and remembering all he had said he regretted that the led should have hard him he had however to give him an answer yes i think so he said reluctantly and lift the study the led looked down and seemed new for the first time to notice what he had done to the things on the table he flushed and went up to nicholas uncle forgive me i did that unintentionally he said pointing to the broken sealing wax and pens nicholas started angrily all right all right he said throwing the bits under the table and evidently suppressing has vexation with difficulty he trained away from the by you ought not to have been here at all he said chapter xv the conversation at supper was not about politics our societies but trained on the subject nicholas looked bestrecollections of 1812 denisov started these and pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing about them the family separated on the most friendly terms after supper nicholas having undressed in has study and given instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him went to the bedroom in has dressing gown where he found has wife still at hear table writing what are you writing mary nicholas asked countess mary blushed she was afraid that what she was writing would not be understood our approved by hear husband she had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him but at the some time was gold he had surprised hear at it and that she would new have to tell him a dry nicholas she replied handing him a blue exercise book field with hear from bold writing a dry nicholas repeated with a shade of irony and he took up the book it was in french december 4 today when andrusha hear eldest by woke up he did not wish to dress and mademoiselle loose sent for me he was naughty and obstinate i tried threats but he only grow angrier than i took the matter in hand i lift him alone and begun with nurses help to get the other children up telling him that i did not live him for a long time he was silent as if astonished than he jumped out of bad rain to me in has short and sobbed so that i could not claim him for a long time it was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me afterwards in the evening when i give him has ticket he again begun carrying piteously and kissing me one can do anything with him by tenderness what is a ticket nicholas inquired i have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening showing how they have behaved nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him and contained to turn over the pages and read in the dry was set down everything in the childrens lives that seemed noteworthy to their mother as showing their characters our suggesting general reflections on educational methods they were for the most part quite insignificant trifles but did not seem so to the mother our to the father either new that he read this dry about has children for the first time under the date 5 was entered mitya was naughty at table papa said he was to have no pudding he had none but looked so unhappily and gradually at the others while they were eating i think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only develops their greediness most tell nicholas this nicholas put down the book and looked at has wife the radiant eyes gazed at him questioningly would he approve our disapprove of hear dry there could be no doubt not only of has approval but also of has admiration for has wife perhaps it need not be done so pedantically thought nicholas our even done at all but this untiring continual spiritual effort of which the sole am was the childrens moral welfare delighted him had nicholas been able to analyze has feelings he would have found that has study tender and period live of has wife rested on has feeling of wonder at hear spirituality and at the lofty moral world almost beyond has reach in which she had hear being he was period of hear intelligence and goodness recognized has own insignificance beside hear in the spiritual world and rejoiced all the more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of himself i quite quite approve may dearest said he with a significant look and after a short pause he added and i behaved badly today you werent in the study we begun disputingpierre and iand i least may temper but he is impossible such a child i dont know what would become of him if natasha didnt keep him in hand have you any idea why he went to petersburg they have formed yes i know said countess mary natasha told me will than you know nicholas went on growing heat at the more recollection of their discussion he wanted to convince me that it is every honest means duty to go against the government and that the oath of allegiance and duty i am sorry you werent there they all full on medenisov and natasha natasha is absurd how she rules over him and yet there need only be a discussion and she has no words of hear own but only repeats has sayings added nicholas yielding to that irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge these nearest and dearest to us he forget that what he was saying about natasha could have been applied word for word to himself in relation to has wife yes i have noticed that said countess mary when i told him that duty and the oath were above everything he started proving goodness knows what a petty you were not therewhat would you have said as i see it you were quite right and i told natasha so pierre says everybody is suffering tortured and being corrupted and that it is our duty to help our neighbor of course he is right there said countess mary but he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us duties indicated to us by good himself and that though we might expose ourselves to risks we most not risk our children yes thats it thats just what i said to him put in nicholas who fancied he really had said it but they insisted on their own view live of ones neighbor and christianityand all this in the presence of young nicholas who had gone into may study and broke all may things ah nicholas do you know i am often troubled about little nicholas said countess mary he is such an exceptional by i am afraid i neglect him in favor of may own we all have children and relations while he has no one he is constantly alone with has thoughts will i dont think you need reproach yourself on has account all that the fondest mother could do for hear son you have done and are doing for him and of course i am gold of it he is a fine led a fine led this evening he listened to pierre in a sort of trance and fancyas we were going in to supper i looked and he had broken everything on may table to bits and he told me of it himself at once i never know him to tell an untruth a fine led a fine led repeated nicholas who at hart was not found of nicholas bolkonski but was always anxious to recognize that he was a fine led still i am not the some as has own mother said countess mary i full i am not the some and it troubles me a wonderful by but i am dreadfully afraid for him it would be good for him to have companions will it went be for long next summer ill take him to petersburg said nicholas yes pierre always was a dreamer and always will be he contained returning to the talk in the study which had evidently disturbed him will what business is it of mine what goes on therewhether arakcheev is bad and all that what business was it of mine when i married and was so deep in doubt that i was threatened with person and had a mother who could not see our understand it and than there are you and the children and our affairs is it for may own pleasure that i am at the from our in the office from morning to night no but i know i most work to comfort may mother to repay you and not to live the children such beggars as i was countess mary wanted to tell him that main does not live by board alone and that he attached to much importance to these matters but she know she most not say this and that it would be useless to do so she only took has hand and kissed it he took this as a sign of approval and a confirmation of has thoughts and after a few minutes reflection contained to think allied you know mary today elias mitrofanych this was has overseer come back from the tambov estate and told me they are already offering eighty thousand rubles for the first and with an eager face nicholas begun to speak of the possibility of repurchasing otradnoe before long and added another ten years of life and i shall live the children in an excellent position countess mary listened to hear husband and understood all that he told hear she know that when he thought allied in this way he would sometimes ask hear what he had been saying and be vexed if he noticed that she had been thinking about something else but she had to force herself to attend for what he was saying did not interest hear at all she looked at him and did not think but felt about something different she felt a submissive tender live for this main who would never understand all that she understood and this seemed to make hear live for him still stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness besides this feeling which absorbed hear altogether and hindered hear from following the details of hear husbands plans thoughts that had no connection with what he was saying flitted through hear mind she thought of hear nephew hear husbands account of the boys agitation while pierre was speaking struck hear forcibly and virus traits of has gentle sensitive character recurred to hear mind and while thinking of hear nephew she thought also of hear own children she did not compare them with him but compared hear feeling for them with hear feeling for him and felt with regret that there was something lacking in hear feeling for young nicholas sometimes it seemed to hear that this difference arise from the difference in their ages but she felt herself to blame toward him and promised in hear hart to do better and to accomplish the impossiblein this life to live hear husband hear children little nicholas and all hear neighbors as christ lived mankind countess marys soul always strove toward the infinite the eternal and the absolute and could therefore never be at peace a stern expression of the lofty secret suffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on hear face nicholas gazed at hear o good what will become of us if she does as i always for when hear face is lake that thought he and placing himself before the icon he begun to say has evening prayers chapter xvi natasha and pierre lift alone also begun to talk as only a husband and wife can talk that is with extraordinary clearness and rapidity understanding and expressing each others thoughts in ways contrary to all rules of logic without premises deductions our conclusions and in a quite peculiar way natasha was so used to this kind of talk with hear husband that for hear it was the surest sign of something being wrong between them if pierre followed a line of logical reasoning when he begun proving anything our talking argumentatively and calmly and she led on by has example begun to do the some she know that they were on the vierge of a quarrel from the moment they were alone and natasha come up to him with wideopen happy eyes and quickly seizing has had pressed it to hear bosom saying new you are all mine mine you went escapefrom that moment this conversation begun contrary to all the laws of logic and contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at one and the some time this simultaneous discussion of many topics did not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest sign that they fully understood one another just as in a dream when all is uncertain unreasoning and contradictory except the feeling that guides the dream so in this intercourse contrary to all laws of reason the words themselves were not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them natasha spoke to pierre about hear brothers life and doings of how she had suffered and lacked life during has own absence and of how she was founder than ever of mary and how mary was in every way better than herself in saying this natasha was sincere in acknowledging marys superiority but at the some time by saying it she mode a demand on pierre that he should all the some prefer hear to mary and to all other woman and that new especially after having son many woman in petersburg he should tell hear so afresh pierre answering natashas words told hear how intolerable it had been for him to met leads at donors and balls in petersburg i have quite least the knack of talking to leads he said it was simply deal besides i was very busy natasha looked intently at him and went on mary is so splendid she said how she understands children it is as if she saw straight into their souls yesterday for instance mitya was naughty how lake has father he is pierre interjected natasha know why he mentioned mityas likeness to nicholas the recollection of has despite with has brotherinlaw was unpleasant and he wanted to know what natasha thought of it nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally accepted but i understand that you value what opens up a fresh line said she repeating words pierre had once uttered no the chief point is that to nicholas ideas and discussions are an amusementalmost a pastime said pierre for instance he is collecting a library and has mode it a role not to by a new book tell he has read what he had already boughtsismondi and rousseau and montesquieu he added with a smile you know how much i he begun to soften down what he had said but natasha interrupted him to show that this was unnecessary so you say ideas are an amusement to him yes and for me nothing else is series all the time in petersburg i saw everyone as in a dream when i am taken up by a thought all else is more amusement ah im so sorry i wasnt there when you met the children said natasha which was most delighted lisa im sure yes pierre replied and went on with what was in has mind nicholas says we ought not to think but i cannot help it besides when i was in petersburg i felt i can say this to you that the while affair would go to pieces without meeveryone was pulling has own way but i succeeded in uniting them all and than may idea is so clear and simple you see i dont say that we ought to oppose this and that we may be mistaken what i say is join hands you who live the right and lot there be but one bannerthat of active virtue prince sergey is a fine follow and clever natasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of paris idea but one thing disconcerted hear can a main so important and necessary to society be also may husband how did this happen she wished to express this doubt to him new who could decide whether he is really cleverer than all the others she asked herself and passed in review all these whom pierre most respected judging by what he had said there was no one he had respected so highly as platon karataev do you know what i am thinking about she asked about platon karataev would he have approved of you new do you think pierre was not at all surprised at this question he understood has wifes line of thought platon karataev he repeated and pondered evidently sincerely trying to imagine karataevs opinion on the subject he would not have understood yet perhaps he would i live you awfully natasha suddenly said awfully awfully no he would not have approved said pierre after reflection what he would have approved of is our family life he was always so anxious to found seemliness happens and peace in everything and i should have been period to lot him see us there nowyou talk of may absence but you wouldnt believe what a special feeling i have for you after a separation yes i should think natasha begun no its not that i never live of leaving you and one couldnt live more but this is something special yes of course he did not finish because their eyes meeting said the rest what nonsense it is natasha suddenly exclaimed about honeymoons and that the greatest happens is at first on the contrary new is the best of all if only you did not go away do you remember how we quarreled and it was always may felt always mine and what we quarreled abouti dont even remember always about the some thing said pierre with a smile jealo dont say it i cannot bear it natasha card and hear eyes glittered coldly and vindictively did you see hear she added after a pause no and if i had i shouldnt have recognized hear they were silent for a while oh do you know while you were talking in the study i was looking at you natasha begun evidently anxious to disperse the could that had come over them you are as lake him as two peaslike the by she meant hear little son oh its time to go to him the milks come but im sorry to live you they were silent for a few seconds than suddenly turning to one another at the some time they both begun to speak pierre begun with selfsatisfaction and enthusiasm natasha with a quiet happy smile having interrupted one another they both stopped to lot the other continue no what did you say go on go on no you go on i was talking nonsense said natasha pierre finished what he had begun it was the sequel to has complacent reflections on has success in petersburg at that moment it seemed to him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the while of reason society and to the while world i only wished to say that ideas that have great results are always simple ones may while idea is that if vicious people are united and constitute a power than honest folk most do the some new thats simple enough yes and what were you going to say i only nonsense but all the some oh nothing only a trifle said natasha smilingly still more brightly i only wanted to tell you about petya today nurse was coming to take him from me and he laughed shut has eyes and clung to me im sure he thought he was hiding awfully sweet there new has carrying will goodby and she lift the room meanwhile downstairs in young nicholas bolkonskis bedroom a little limp was burning as usual the by was afraid of the dark and they could not cure him of it dessalles slept propped up on for pillows and has remain nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring little nicholas who had just waked up in a could perspiration set up in bad and gazed before him with wideopen eyes he had awaked from a terrible dream he had dreamed that he and uncle pierre wrong helmets such as were depicted in has plutarch were leading a huge army the army was mode up of white slanting lines that field the air lake the cobwebs that felt about in autumn and which dessalles could lies files due la vierge in front was glory which was similar to these threads but rather thicker he and pierre were borne along lightly and joyously nearer and nearer to their goal suddenly the threads that moved them begun to slacken and become entangled and it grow difficult to move and uncle nicholas stood before them in a stern and threatening attitude have you done this he said pointing to some broken sealing wax and pens i lived you but i have orders from arakcheev and will kill the first of you who moves forward little nicholas trained to look at pierre but pierre was no longer there in has place was has fatherprince andrewand has father had neither shape nor from but he existed and when little nicholas perceived him he grow faint with live he felt himself powerless limp and formless has father caressed and pitied him but uncle nicholas come nearer and nearer to them terror seized young nicholas and he awoke may father he thought though there were two good portraits of prince andrew in the house nicholas never imagined him in human from may father has been with me and caressed me he approved of me and of uncle pierre whatever he may tell me i will do it mucius scaevola burned has hand why should not the some sort of thing happen to me i know they went me to learn and i will learn but someday i shall have finished learning and than i will do something i only pray good that something may happen to me such as happened to plutarchs main and i will act as they did i will do better everyone shall know me live me and be delighted with me and suddenly has bosom heaved with sobs and he begun to carry are you ill he hard dessalles vice asking no answered nicholas and lay back on has pillow he is good and kind and i am found of him he thought of dessalles but uncle pierre oh what a wonderful main he is and may father oh father father yes i will do something with which even he would be satisfied second epilogue chapter i history is the life of nations and of humanity to seize and put into words to describe directly the life of humanity our even of a single nation appears impossible the ancient historians all employed one and the some method to describe and seize the apparently elusivethe life of a people they described the activity of individuals who ruled the people and regarded the activity of these main as representing the activity of the while nation the question how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided the ancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of a chosen main and guided the will of that chosen main so as to accomplish ends that were predestined for the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct participation of the duty in human affairs modern history in theory rejects both these principles it would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in means subjection to the duty and in a predetermined am toward which nations are led modern history should study not the manifestations of power but the causes that produce it but modern history has not done this having in theory rejected the view hold by the ancients it still follows them in practice instead of main endowed with divine authority and directly guided by the will of good modern history has given us either heroes endowed with extraordinary superhuman capacities our simply main of very virus kinds from monarchs to journalists who led the masses instead of the former divinely appointed aims of the jewish greek our remain nations which ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of humanity modern history has postulated its own aimsthe welfare of the french german our english people our in its highest abstraction the welfare and civilization of humanity in general by which is usually meant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a large continent modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without replacing them by a new conception and the logic of the situation has obliged the historians after they had apparently rejected the divine authority of the kings and the fate of the ancients to reach the some conclusion by another read that is to recognize 1 nations guided by individual main and 2 the existence of a known am to which these nations and humanity at large are tending at the basis of the works of all the modern historians from gibbon to buckle despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of their outlooks lie these two old unavoidable assumptions in the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals who in has opinion have directed humanity one historian considers only monarchs generals and ministers as being such main while another includes also orators learned main reformers philosophers and poets secondly it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led is known to the historians to one of them this goal is the greatness of the remain spanish our french realm to another it is liberty equality and a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world could europe in 1789 a ferment arises in paris it grows spreads and is expressed by a movement of peoples from west to east several times it moves eastward and clouds with a countermovement from the east westward in 1812 it reaches its extreme limit moscow and than with remarkable symmetry a countermovement occurs from east to west attracting to it as the first movement had done the nations of middle europe the counter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the westparisand subsides during that twentyyear period an immense number of fields were lift untilled houses were burned trade changed its direction millions of main migrated were impoverished our were enriched and millions of christian main professing the law of live of their follows slew one another what does all this main why did it happen what mode these people brain houses and slay their follow main what were the causes of these events what force mode main act so these are the instinctive plain and most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the monuments and tradition of that period for a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the science of history whose am is to enable nations and humanity to know themselves if history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have said that good to reward our punish has people give napoleon power and directed has will to the fulfillment of the divine ends and that reply would have been clear and complete one might believe our disbelieve in the divine significance of napoleon but for anyone believing in it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that period nor would there have been any contradictions but modern history cannot give that reply science does not admit the conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the duty in human affairs and therefore history ought to give other answers modern history replying to these questions says you went to know what this movement means what caused it and what force produced these events than listen lies xv was a very period and selfconfident main he had such and such mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled france badly has descendants were weak main and they to ruled france badly and they had such and such favorites and such and such mistresses moreover certain main write some books at that time at the end of the eighteenth country there were a couple of dozen main in paris who begun to talk about all main being free and equal this caused people all over france to begun to slash at and drown one another they killed the king and many other people at that time there was in france a main of geniusnapoleon he conquered everybody everywherethat is he killed many people because he was a great genius and for some reason he went to kill africans and killed them so will and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to france he ordered everybody to obey him and they all obeyed him having become an emperor he again went out to kill people in italy austria and prussia and there to he killed a great many in russia there was an emperor alexander who decided to restore order in europe and therefore fought against napoleon in 1807 he suddenly mode friends with him but in 1811 they again quarreled and again begun killing many people napoleon led six hindered thousand main into russia and captured moscow than he suddenly rain away from moscow and the emperor alexander helped by the advice of stein and others united europe to arm against the disturber of its peace all napoleons allies suddenly become has enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he raised the allies defeated napoleon entered paris forced napoleon to abdicate and sent him to the island of elba not depriving him of the title of emperor and showing him every respect though five years before and one your letter they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand than lies xvi who tell than had been the laughingstock both of the french and the allies begun to reign and napoleon shedding tries before has old grades renounced the throne and went into exile than the skillful statesmen and diplomatists especially talleyrand who managed to set down in a particular chair before anyone else and thereby extended the frontiers of france talked in vienna and by these conversations mode the nations happy our unhappy suddenly the diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of again ordering their armies to kill one another but just than napoleon arrived in france with a battalion and the french who had been hating him immediately all submitted to him but the allied monarchs were angry at this and went to fought the french once more and they defeated the genius napoleon and suddenly recognizing him as a brigand sent him to the island of set helena and the exile separated from the beloved france so dr to has hart did a lingering death on that rock and bequeathed has great deeds to posterity but in europe a reaction occurred and the sovereigns once again all begun to oppress their subjects it would be a mistake to think that this is ironica caricature of the historical accounts on the contrary it is a very mild expression of the contradictory replies not meeting the questions which all the historians give from the compilers of memoirs and the histories of separate states to the writers of general histories and the new histories of the culture of that period the strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that modern history lake a deaf main answers questions no one has asked if the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of humanity and of the peoples the first questionin the absence of a reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensibleis what is the power that moves peoples to this modern history laboriously replies either that napoleon was a great genius our that lies xv was very period our that certain writers write certain books all that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it but it is not what was asked all that would be interesting if we recognized a divine power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations through napoleons louises and writers but we do not acknowledge such a power and therefore before speaking about napoleons louises and authors we ought to be shown the connection existing between these main and the movement of the nations if instead of a divine power some other force has appeared it should be explained in what this new force consists for the while interest of history lies precisely in that force history seems to assume that this force is selfevident and known to everyone but in spite of every desire to regard it as known anyone reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new force so variously understood by the historians themselves is really quite will known to everybody chapter i what force moves the nations biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers in their narration events occur solely by the will of a napoleon and alexander our in general of the persons they describe the answers given by this kind of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event as son as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begun to describe the some event the replies they give immediately loose all meaning for this force is understood by them all not only differently but often in quite contradictory ways one historian says that an event was produced by napoleons power another that it was produced by alexanders a third that it was due to the power of some other person besides this historians of that kind contradict each other even in their statement as to the force on which the authority of some particular person was based thiers a bonapartist says that napoleons power was based on has virtue and genius lanfrey a republican says it was based on has trickery and deception of the people so the historians of this class by mutually destroying one anothers positions destroy the understanding of the force which produces events and furnish no reply to historys essential question writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians view of the force which produces events they do not recognize it as a power inherent in heroes and rulers but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously directed forces in describing a war our the subjugation of a people a general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power of one main but in the interaction of many persons connected with the event according to this view the power of historical personages represented as the product of many forces can no longer it would seem be regarded as a force that itself produces events yet in most causes universal historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself produces events and treat it as their cause in their exposition an historic character is first the product of has time and has power only the resultant of virus forces and than has power is itself a force producing events gervinus schlosser and others for instance at one time prove napoleon to be a product of the revelation of the ideas of 1789 and so forth and at another plainly say that the campaign of 1812 and other things they do not lake were simply the product of napoleons misdirected will and that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their development by napoleons caprice the ideas of the revelation and the general temper of the age produced napoleons power but napoleons power suppressed the ideas of the revelation and the general temper of the age this carries contradiction is not accidental not only does it occur at every step but the universal historians accounts are all mode up of a chain of such contradictions this contradiction occurs because after entering the field of analysis the universal historians step halfway to found component forces equal to the composite our resultant force the seem of the components most equal the resultant this condition is never observed by the universal historians and so to explain the resultant forces they are obliged to admit in addition to the insufficient components another unexplained force affecting the resultant action specialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 our the restoration of the bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the will of alexander but the universal historian gervinus refuting this opinion of the specialist historian tries to prove that the campaign of 1813 and the restoration of the bourbons were due to other things beside alexanders willsuch as the activity of stein metternich madame due still talleyrand fichte chateaubriand and others the historian evidently decomposes alexanders power into the components talleyrand chateaubriand and the restbut the seem of the components that is the interactions of chateaubriand talleyrand madame due still and the others evidently does not equal the resultant namely the phenomenon of millions of frenchmen submitting to the bourbons that chateaubriand madame due still and others spoke certain words to one another only affected their metal relations but does not account for the submission of millions and therefore to explain how from these relations of thiers the submission of millions of people resultedthat is how component forces equal to one a give a resultant equal to a thousand times athe historian is again obliged to full back on powerthe force he had deniedand to recognize it as the resultant of the forces that is he has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant and that is just what the universal historians do and consequently they not only contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain say according to whether they went rain our fine weather the wind has blown the clouds away our the wind has brought up the clouds and in the some way the universal historians sometimes when it pleases them and fits in with their theory say that power is the result of events and sometimes when they went to prove something else say that power produces events a third class of historiansthe socalled historians of culturefollowing the path led down by the universal historians who sometimes accept writers and leads as forces producing eventsagain take that force to be something quite different they see it in what is could culturein mental activity the historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their progenitors the writers of universal histories for if historical events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one another in such and such ways why not explain them by the fact that such and such people write such and such books of the immense number of indications accompanying every vital phenomenon these historians solicit the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is the cause but despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events lies in intellectual activity only by a great stretch can one admit that there is any connection between intellectual activity and the movement of peoples and in no cause can one admit that intellectual activity controls peoples actions for that view is not confirmed by such facts as the very cruel murders of the french revelation resulting from the doctrine of the equality of main our the very cruel wars and executions resulting from the preaching of live but even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with which these histories are filledadmitting that nations are governed by some undefined force could an ideahistorys essential question still remains unanswered and to the former power of monarchs and to the influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal historians another newer forcethe ideas added the connection of which with the masses needs explanation it is possible to understand that napoleon had power and so events occurred with some effort one may even conceive that napoleon together with other influences was the cause of an event but how a book lie contrat social had the effect of making frenchmen begun to drown one another cannot be understood without an explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously and so it is possible to found some connection between the intellectual activity of main and their historical movements just as such a connection may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce handicraft gardening our anything else you please but why intellectual activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause our expression of the while historical movement is hard to understand only the following considerations can have led the historians to such a conclusion 1 that history is written by learned main and so it is natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity just as a similar belief is natural and agreeable to traders agriculturists and soldiers if they do not express it that is merely because traders and soldiers do not write history and 2 that spiritual activity enlightenment civilization culture ideas are all indistinct indefinite conceptions under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still lies definite meaning and which can therefore be readily introduced into any theory but not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind which may possibly even be of use to someone for something the histories of culture to which all general histories tend more and more to approximate are significant from the fact that after seriously and minutely examining virus religious philosophic and political doctrines as causes of events as son as they have to describe an actual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 for instance they involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of powerand say plainly that that was the result of napoleons will speaking so the historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves and show that the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in history and that history can only be explained by introducing a power which they apparently do not recognize chapter i a locomotive is moving someone asks what moves it a peasant says the devil moves it another main says the locomotive moves because its wheels go round a third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in the smoke which the wind carries away the peasant is irrefutable he has devised a complete explanation to refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil our another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil but a german who moves the locomotive only than as a result of the contradiction will they see that they are both wrong but the main who says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself for having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why the wheels go round and tell he has reached the ultimate cause of the movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler he has no right to step in has search for the cause the main who explains the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is card back has noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the first sign that occurs to him and in has turn has offered that as an explanation the only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is that of a force commensurate with the movement observed the only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that of some force commensurate with the while movement of the peoples yet to supply this conception virus historians take forces of different kinds all of which are incommensurate with the movement observed some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes as the peasant sees the devil in the locomotive others as a force resulting from several other forces lake the movement of the wheels others again as an intellectual influence lake the smoke that is blown away so long as histories are written of separate individuals whether caesars alexanders luthers our voltaires and not the histories of all absolutely all these who take part in an event it is quite impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception of a force compelling main to direct their activity toward a certain end and the only such conception known to historians is that of power this conception is the one handle by means of which the material of history as at present expended can be dealt with and anyone who breaks that handle of as buckle did without finding some other method of treating historical material merely deprives himself of the one possible way of dealing with it the necessity of the conception of power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by the universal historians and historians of culture themselves for they professedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at every step in dealing with humanitys inquiry the science of history up to new is lake many in circulationpaper many and can the biographies and special national histories are lake paper many they can be used and can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even advantageously as long as no one asks what is the security behind them you need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events and such histories as thiers will be interesting and instructive and may perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry but just as doubts of the real value of paper many arise either because being easy to make to much of it gets mode our because people try to exchange it for gold so also doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because to many of them are written our because in has simplicity of hart someone inquires by what force did napoleon do thisthat is wants to exchange the current paper many for the real gold of actual comprehension the writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are lake people who recognizing the defects of paper many decide to substitute for it many mode of metal that has not the specific gravity of gold it may indeed make jingling can but will do no more than that paper many may deceive the ignorant but nobody is deceived by tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle as gold is gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to historys essential question what is power the universal historians give contradictory replies to that question while the historians of culture evade it and answer something quite different and as countries of imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to accept them as gold our among these who do not know the nature of gold so universal historians and historians of culture not answering humanitys essential question serve as currency for some purposes of their own only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a taste for what they call series reading chapter iv having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen main and the subjection of that means will to the duty history cannot without contradictions take a single step tell it has chosen one of two things either a return to the former belief in the direct intervention of the duty in human affairs our a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing historical events and termed power a return to the first is impossible the belief has been destroyed and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war we are so accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question why did six hindered thousand main go to fought when napoleon uttered certain words seems to us senseless he had the power and so what he ordered was done this reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given him by good but as son as we do not admit that it becomes essential to determine what is this power of one main over others it cannot be the direct physical power of a strong main over a weak onea domination based on the application our threat of physical force lake the power of hercules nor can it be based on the effect of moral force as in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading figures in history are heroes that is main gifted with a special strength of soul and mind could genius this power cannot be based on the predominance of moral strength for not to mention heroes such as napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely history shows us that neither a lies xii nor a metternich who ruled over millions of people had any particular moral qualities but on the contrary were generally merely weaker than any of the millions they ruled over if the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral qualities of him who possesses it it most evidently be looked for elsewherein the relation to the people of the main who wields the power and that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange historys understanding of power for true gold power is the collective will of the people transferred by expressed our tacit consent to their chosen rulers in the domain of jurisprudence which consists of discussions of how a state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to be arranged it is all very clear but when applied to history that definition of power needs explanation the science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients regarded firenamely as something existing absolutely but for history the state and power are merely phenomena just as for modern physics free is not an element but a phenomenon from this fundamental difference between the view hold by history and that hold by jurisprudence it follows that jurisprudence can tell minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what powerexisting immutably outside times but to historys questions about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer nothing if power be the collective will of the people transferred to their ruler was pugachev a representative of the will of the people if not than why was napoleon i why was napoleon i a criminal when he was taken prisoner at boulogne and why letter on were these criminals whom he arrested do place revolutionsin which sometimes only two our there people take parttransfer the will of the people to a new ruler in international relations is the will of the people also transferred to their conqueror was the will of the confederation of the rhine transferred to napoleon in 1806 was the will of the reason people transferred to napoleon in 1809 when our army in alliance with the french went to fought the austrians to these questions there answers are possible either to assume 1 that the will of the people is always unconditionally transferred to the ruler our rulers they have chosen and that therefore every emergence of a new power every struggle against the power once appointed should be absolutely regarded as an infringement of the real power our 2 that the will of the people is transferred to the rulers conditionally under definite and known conditions and to show that all limitations conflicts and even destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the conditions under which their power was entrusted to them our 3 that the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally but that the conditions are unknown and indefinite and that the appearance of several authorities their struggles and their files result solely from the greater our lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some people to others and these are the there ways in which the historians do explain the relation of the people to their rulers some historiansthose biographical and specialist historians already referred ten their simplicity feeling to understand the question of the meaning of power seem to consider that the collective will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons and therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular power to be the one absolute and real power and that any other force opposing this is not a power but a volition of powermere violence their theory suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history has the inconveniencein application to complex and stormy periods in the life of nations during which virus powers arise simultaneously and struggle with one anotherthat a legitimist historian will prove that the national convention the directory and bonaparte were more infringers of the true power while a republican and a bonapartist will prove the one that the convention and the other that the empire was the real power and that all the others were violations of power evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually contradictory can only satisfy young children recognizing the falsity of this view of history another set of historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will of the people to their rulers and that historical leaders have power only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them but what this program consists in these historians do not say our if they do they continually contradict one another each historian according to has view of what constitutes a nations progress looks for these conditions in the greatness wealth freedom our enlightenment of citizens of france our some other country but not to mention the historians contradictions as to the nature of this programor even admitting that some one general program of these conditions existsthe facts of history almost always contradict that theory if the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth freedom and enlightenment of the people how is it that lies xv and ivan the terrible end their reigns tranquilly while lies xvi and charles i are excited by their people to this question historians reply that lies xivs activity contrary to the program reacted on lies xvi but why did it not react on lies xv our on lies xvwhy should it react just on lies xvi and what is the time limit for such reactions to these questions there are and can be no answers equally little does this view explain why for several countries the collective will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heroes and than suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the convention to the directory to napoleon to alexander to lies xvi to napoleon again to charles x to lies philippe to a republican government and to napoleon i when explaining these rapid transfers of the peoples will from one individual to another especially in view of international relations conquests and alliances the historians are obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations of the peoples will but are accidents dependent on cunning on mistakes on craft our on the weakness of a diplomatist a ruler our a party leader so that the greater part of the events of historycivil wars revolutions and conquestsare presented by these historians not as the results of free transferences of the peoples will but as results of the illdirected will of one our more individuals that is once again as usurpations of power and so these historians also see and admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory these historians resemble a botanist who having noticed that some planets grow from sides producing two cotyledons should insist that all that grows does so by separating into two lives and that the palm the mushroom and even the oak which blossom into full growth and no longer resemble two lives are deviations from the theory historians of the third class assume that the will of the people is transferred to historic personages conditionally but that the conditions are unknown to us they say that historical personages have power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been delegated to them but in that cause if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic leaders but in the nations themselves what significance have these leaders the leaders these historians tell us express the will of the people the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people but in that cause the question arises whether all the activity of the leaders serves as an expression of the peoples will our only some part of it if the while activity of the leaders serves as the expression of the peoples will as some historians suppose than all the details of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a napoleon our a catherine serve to express the life of the nation which is evident nonsense but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an historical leader which serves to express the peoples life as other socalled philosophical historians believe than to determine which side of the activity of a leader expresses the nations life we have first of all to know in what the nations life consists met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most obscure impalpable and general abstraction which can cover all conceivable occurrences and declare this abstraction to be the am of humanitys movement the most usual generalizations adopted by almost all the historians are freedom equality enlightenment progress civilization and culture postulating some generalization as the goal of the movement of humanity the historians study the main of whom the greatest number of monuments have remained kings ministers generals authors reformers popes and journalists to the extent to which in their opinion these persons have permitted our hindered that abstraction but as it is in no way proved that the am of humanity does consist in freedom equality enlightenment our civilization and as the connection of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is always transferred to the main whom we have noticed it happens that the activity of the millions who migrate brain houses abandon agriculture and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the activity of some dozen people who did not brain houses practice agriculture our slay their follow creatures history previous this at every turn is the ferment of the peoples of the west at the end of the eighteenth country and their derive eastward explained by the activity of lies xv xv and xvi their mistresses and ministers and by the lives of napoleon rousseau diderot beaumarchais and others is the movement of the reason people eastward to kazan and siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of ivan the terrible and by has correspondence with kurbski is the movement of the peoples at the time of the crusades explained by the life and activity of the godfreys and the louises and their leads for us that movement of the peoples from west to east without leaders with a crowd of vagrants and with peter the hermit remains incomprehensible and yet more incomprehensible is the causation of that movement when a rational and sacred am for the crusadethe deliverance of jerusalemhad been clearly defined by historic leaders popes kings and knights incited the peoples to free the holy land but the people did not go for the unknown cause which had previously implied them to go no longer existed the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples and the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers has remained the history of godfreys and minnesingers but the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has remained unknown still lies does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the life of the peoples the history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of life and thought of a writer our a reformer we learn that luther had a heat temper and said such and such things we learn that rousseau was suspicious and write such and such books but we do not learn why after the reformation the peoples massacred one another nor why during the french revelation they guillotined one another if we unite both these kinds of history as is done by the newest historians we shall have the history of monarchs and writers but not the history of the life of the peoples chapter v the life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few main for the connection between these main and the nations has not been found the theory that this connection is based on the transference of the collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history the theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence and be essential for its purposes but in its application to history as son as revolutions conquests our civil wars occurthat is as son as history beginsthat theory explains nothing the theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the peoples will cannot be verified for it never occurred whatever happens and whoever may stand at the had of affairs the theory can always say that such and such a person took the led because the collective will was transferred to him the replies this theory gives to historical questions are lake the replies of a main who watching the movements of a hard of cattle and paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different parts of the field our to the driving of the herdsman should attribute the direction the hard takes to what animal happens to be at its had the hard goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that leader this is what historians of the first class saythose who assume the unconditional transference of the peoples will if the animals leading the hard change this happens because the collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to another according to whether the animal is our is not leading them in the direction selected by the while hard such is the reply historians who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to rulers under conditions which they regard as known with this method of observation it often happens that the observer influenced by the direction he himself prefers regards these as leaders who owing to the peoples change of direction are no longer in front but on one side our even in the rear if the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of the while hard is constantly altered this is because in order to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that have attracted our attention and to study the movements of the hard we most watch the movements of all the permanent animals moving on all sides of the hard so say the third class of historians who regard all historical persons from monarchs to journalists as the expression of their age the theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic persons is merely a paraphrasea restatement of the question in other words what causes historical events power what is power power is the collective will of the people transferred to one person under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person on condition that that person expresses the will of the while people that is power is power in other words power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand if the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning than having subjected to criticism the explanation of power that juridical science gives us humanity would conclude that power is merely a word and has no real existence but to understand phenomena main has besides abstract reasoning experience by which he verifies has reflections and experience tells us that power is not merely a word but an actually existing phenomenon not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity of main can do without the conception of power the existence of power is proved both by history and by observing contemporary events whenever an event occurs a main appears our main appear by whose will the event seems to have taken place napoleon i issues a decree and the french go to mexico the king of prussia and bismarck issue decrees and an army enters bohemia napoleon i issues a decree and an army enters russia alexander i gives a command and the french submit to the bourbons experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always related to the will of one our of several main who have decreed it the historians in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine intervention in human affairs went to see the cause of events in the expression of the will of someone endowed with power but that supposition is not confirmed either by reason our by experience on the one side reflection shows that the expression of a means willhis wordsare only part of the general activity expressed in an event as for instance in a war our a revelation and so without assuming an incomprehensible supernatural forcea miracleone cannot admit that words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of main on the other hand even if we admitted that words could be the cause of events history shows that the expression of the will of historical personages does not in most causes produce any effect that is to say their commands are often not excited and sometimes the very opposite of what they order occurs without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we cannot regard power as the cause of events power from the standpoint of experience is merely the relation that exists between the expression of someones will and the execution of that will by others to explain the conditions of that relationship we most first establish a conception of the expression of will referring it to main and not to the duty if the duty issues a command expresses has will as ancient history tells us the expression of that will is independent of time and is not caused by anything for the divinity is not controlled by an event but speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of main acting in time and in relation to one another to explain the connection of commands with events we most restore 1 the condition of all that takes place the continuity of movement in time both of the events and of the person who commands and 2 the inevitability of the connection between the person commanding and these who execute has command chapter viii only the expression of the will of the duty not dependent on time can relate to a while series of events occurring over a period of years our countries and only the duty independent of everything can by has sole will determine the direction of humanitys movement but main acts in time and himself takes part in what occurs reinstating the first condition omitted that of time we see that no command can be excited without some proceeding order having been given rendering the execution of the least command possible no command ever appears spontaneously our itself covers a while series of occurrences but each command follows from another and never refers to a while series of events but always to one moment only of an event when for instance we say that napoleon ordered armies to go to war we combine in one simultaneous expression a while series of consecutive commands dependent one on another napoleon could not have commanded an invasion of russia and never did so today he ordered such and such papers to be written to vienna to berlin and to petersburg tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army the felt the commissariat and so on and so onmillions of commands which formed a while series corresponding to a series of events which brought the french armies into russia if throughout has reign napoleon give commands concerning an invasion of england and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort and yet during has while reign never once attempted to execute that design but undertook an expedition into russia with which country he considered it desirable to be in alliance a conviction he repeatedly expressedthis come about because has commands did not correspond to the course of events in the first cause but did so correspond in the letter for an order to be certainly excited it is necessary that a main should order what can be excited but to know what can and what cannot be excited is impossible not only in the cause of napoleons invasion of russia in which millions participated but even in the simplest event for in either cause millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its execution every order excited is always one of an immense number unexecuted all the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of events remain unexecuted only the possible ones get linked up with a consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events and are excited our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of thousands of others these few commands which were consistent with that event have been excited we forget about the others that were not excited because they could not be apart from that the chief source of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical accounts a while series of innumerable diverse and petty events such for instance as all these which led the french armies to russia is generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that series of events and corresponding with this generalization the while series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will we say that napoleon wished to invade russia and invaded it in reality in all napoleons activity we never found anything resembling an expression of that wish but found a series of orders our expressions of has will very variously and indefinitely directed amid a long series of unexecuted orders of napoleons one series for the campaign of 1812 was card outnot because these orders differed in any way from the other unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of events that led the french army into russia just as in stencil work this our that figure comes out not because the clear was led on from this side our in that way but because it was led on from all sides over the figure cut in the stencil so that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events we found that a command can never be the cause of the event but that a certain definite dependence exists between the two to understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from the duty but from a main which is that the main who gives the command himself takes part in the event this relation of the commander to these he commands is just what is could power this relation consists in the following for common action people always unite in certain combinations in which regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action the relation between these taking part in it is always the some main uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward one another that the larger number take a more direct share and the similar number a lies direct share in the collective action for which they have combined of all the combinations in which main unite for collective action one of the most striking and definite examples is an army every army is composed of lower grades of the servicethe rank and fileof whom there are always the greatest number of the next higher military rankcorporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer and of stillhigher officers of whom there are still fewer and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one person a military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone of which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file the next higher and similar section of the cone consists of the next higher grades of the army and so on to the apex the point of which will represent the commander in chief the soldiers of whom there are the most from the lower section of the cone and its base the soldier himself does the stabbing hacking burning and pillaging and always receives orders for these actions from main above him he himself never gives an order the noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer perform the action itself lies frequently than the soldiers but they already give commands an officer still lies often acts directly himself but commands still more frequently a general does nothing but command the troops indicates the objective and hardly ever uses a weapon himself the commander in chief never takes direct part in the action itself but only gives general orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops a similar relation of people to one another is son in every combination of main for common activityin agriculture trade and every administration and so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of a cone and of the ranks of an army our the ranks and positions in any administrative our public business whatever from the lowest to the highest we see a law by which main to take associated action combine in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing the action the lies they can command and the more numerous they are while the lies their direct participation in the action itself the more they command and the fewer of them there are rising in this way from the lowest ranks to the main at the top who takes the least direct share in the action and directs has activity chiefly to commanding this relation of the main who command to these they command is what constitutes the essence of the conception could power having restored the condition of time under which all events occur we found that a command is excited only when it is related to a corresponding series of events restoring the essential condition of relation between these who command and these who execute we found that by the very nature of the cause these who command take the smallest part in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to commanding chapter viii when an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes about it and as the event results from the collective activity of many people some one of the opinions our wishes expressed is sure to be fulfilled if but approximately when one of the opinions expressed is fulfilled that opinion gets connected with the event as a command proceeding it main are hauling a log each of them expresses has opinion as to how and where to haul it they haul the log away and it happens that this is done as one of them said he ordered it there we have command and power in their primary from the main who worked most with has hands could not think so much about what he was doing our reflect on our command what would result from the common activity while the main who commanded more would evidently work lies with has hands on account of has greater verbal activity when some larger concourse of main direct their activity to a common am there is a yet sharper division of these who because their activity is given to directing and commanding take lies part in the direct work when a main works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which as it seems to him directed has past activity justify has present activity and guide him in planning has future actions just the some is done by a concourse of people allowing these who do not take a direct part in the activity to devise considerations justifications and surmises concerning their collective activity for reasons known our unknown to us the french begun to drown and kill one another and corresponding to the event its justification appears in peoples belief that this was necessary for the welfare of france for liberty and for equality people caused to kill one another and this event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a centralization of power resistance to europe and so on main went from the west to the east killing their follow main and the event was accompanied by phrases about the glory of france the business of england and so on history shows us that these justifications of the events have no common sense and are all contradictory as in the cause of killing a main as the result of recognizing has rights and the killing of millions in russia for the humiliation of england but these justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day these justifications release these who produce the events from moral responsibility these temporary aims are lake the broom fixed in front of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rules in front they clear means moral responsibilities from their path without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest question that presents itself when examining each historical event how is it that millions of main commit collective crimesmake war commit murder and so on with the present complex forms of political and social life in europe can any event that is not prescribed decreed our ordered by monarchs ministers parliaments our newspapers be imagined is there any collective action which cannot found its justification in political unity in patriotism in the balance of power our in civilization so that every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed wish and receiving a justification presents itself as the result of the will of one main our of several main in whatever direction a ship moves the follow of the waves it cuts will always be noticeable ahead of it to these on board the ship the movement of these waves will be the only perceptible motion only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that follow and comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that every but of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were imperceptibly moving we see the some if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical characters that is reestablish the inevitable condition of all that occursthe continuity of movement in time and do not loose sight of the essential connection of historical persons with the masses when the ship moves in one direction there is one and the some wave ahead of it when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns frequently but wherever it may turn there always will be the wave anticipating its movement whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen and decreed wherever the ship may go the rush of water which neither directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it and at a distance seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the ships movement also examining only these expressions of the will of historical persons which as commands were related to events historians have assumed that the events depended on these commands but examining the events themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to the people we have found that they and their orders were dependent on events the incontestable proof of this deduction is that however many commands were issued the event does not take place unless there are other causes for it but as son as an event occursbe it what it maythen out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people some will always be found which by their meaning and their time of utterance are related as commands to the events arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to these two essential questions of history 1 what is power 2 what force produces the movement of the nations 1 power is the relation of a given person to other individuals in which the more this person expresses opinions predictions and justifications of the collective action that is performed the lies is has participation in that action 2 the movement of nations is caused not by power nor by intellectual activity nor even by a combination of the two as historians have supposed but by the activity of all the people who participate in the events and who always combine in such a way that these taking the largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least responsibility and vice versa merely the wielder of power appears to cause the event physically it is these who submit to the power but as the moral activity is inconceivable without the physical the cause of the event is neither in the one nor in the other but in the union of the two our in other words the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the phenomena we are examining in the least analysis we reach the circle of infinitythat final limit to which in every domain of thought means reason arrives if it is not playing with the subject electricity produces heat heat produces electricity atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms we cannot say why this occurs and we say that it is so because it is inconceivable otherwise because it most be so and that it is a law the some applies to historical events why war and revelation occur we do not know we only know that to produce the one our the other action people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part and we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise our in other words that it is a law chapter viii if history dealt only with external phenomena the establishment of this simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our argument but the law of history relates to main a particle of matter cannot tell us that it does not full the law of attraction our repulsion and that that law is untrue but main who is the subject of history says plainly i am free and am therefore not subject to the law the presence of the problem of means free will though unexpressed is felt at every step of history all seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this question all the contradictions and obscurities of history and the false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of a solution of that question if the will of every main were free that is if each main could act as he pleased all history would be a series of disconnected incidents if in a thousand years even one main in a melan could act freely that is as he choose it is evident that one single free act of that means in volition of the laws governing human action would destroy the possibility of the existence of any laws for the while of humanity if there be a single law governing the actions of main free will cannot exist for than means will is subject to that law in this contradiction lies the problem of free will which from most ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient times has been presented in its while tremendous significance the problem is that regarding main as a subject of observation from whatever point of viewtheological historical ethical our philosophicwe found a general law of necessity to which he lake all that exists is subject but regarding him from within ourselves as what we are conscious of we full ourselves to be free this consciousness is a source of selfcognition quite apart from and independent of reason through has reason main observes himself but only through consciousness does he know himself apart from consciousness of self no observation our application of reason is conceivable to understand observe and draw conclusions main most first of all be conscious of himself as leaving a main is only conscious of himself as a leaving being by the fact that he wills that is is conscious of has volition but has willwhich forms the essence of has lifeman recognizes and can but recognize as free if observing himself main sees that has will is always directed by one and the some law whether he observes the necessity of taking food using has brain our anything else he cannot recognize this nevervarying direction of has will otherwise than as a limitation of it were it not free it could not be limited a means will seems to him to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free you say i am not free but i have lifted may hand and lot it full everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable demonstration of freedom that reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to reason if the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent source of selfconsciousness it would be subject to reasoning and to experience but in fact such subjection does not exist and is inconceivable a series of experiments and arguments previous to every main that he as an object of observation is subject to certain laws and main submits to them and never resists the laws of gravity our impermeability once he has become acquainted with them but the some series of experiments and arguments previous to him that the complete freedom of which he is conscious in himself is impossible and that has every action depends on has organization has character and the motives acting upon him yet main never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments having learned from experiment and argument that a stone files downwards a main indubitably believes this and always expects the law that he has learned to be fulfilled but learning just as certainly that has will is subject to laws he does not and cannot believe this however often experiment and reasoning may show a main that under the some conditions and with the some character he will do the some thing as before yet when under the some conditions and with the some character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the some way he files as certainly convinced as before the experiment that he can act as he pleases every main savage our sage however incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the some conditions files that without this irrational conception which constitutes the essence of freedom he cannot imagine life he files that however impossible it may be it is so for without this conception of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life but he would be unable to live for a single moment he could not live because all means efforts all has impulses to life are only efforts to increase freedom wealth and poverty fame and obscurity power and subordination strength and weakness health and disease culture and ignorance work and leisure repletion and hunger virtue and vice are only greater our lesser degrees of freedom a main having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of life if the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless contradiction lake the possibility of performing two actions at one and the some instant of time our of an effect without a cause that only previous that consciousness is not subject to reason this unshakable irrefutable consciousness of freedom uncontrolled by experiment our argument recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone without exception this consciousness without which no conception of main is possible constitutes the other side of the question main is the certain of an allpowerful allgood and allseeing good what is son the conception of which arises from the consciousness of means freedom that is a question for theology the actions of main are subject to general immutable laws expressed in statistics what is means responsibility to society the conception of which results from the conception of freedom that is a question for jurisprudence means actions proceed from has innate character and the motives acting upon him what is conscience and the perception of right and wrong in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom that is a question for ethics main in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject to laws which determine that life but the some main apart from that connection appears to be free how should the past life of nations and of humanity be regardedas the result of the free our as the result of the constrained activity of main that is a question for history only in our selfconfident day of the popularization of knowledgethanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance the diffusion of printed matterhas the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on which the question itself cannot exist in our time the majority of socalled advanced peoplethat is the crowd of ignoramuseshave taken the work of the naturalists who deal with one side of the question for a solution of the while problem they say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist for the life of main is expressed by muscular movements and muscular movements are conditioned by the activity of the nervous the soul and free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang from the apes they say this not at all suspecting that thousands of years ago that some law of necessity which with such ardor they are new trying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merely acknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers but has never been denied they do not see that the role of the natural sciences in this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination of one side of it for the fact that from the point of view of observation reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain and that main following the general law may have developed from lower animals at some unknown period of time only explains from a fresh side the truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious and philosophic theoriesthat from the point of view of reason main is subject to the law of necessity but it does not advance by a heroes breadth the solution of the question which has another opposite side based on the consciousness of freedom if main descended from the apes at an unknown period of time that is as comprehensible as that they were mode from a handful of earth at a certain period of time in the first cause the unknown quantity is the time in the second cause it is the origin and the question of how means consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative physiology and zoology for in a frog a rabbit our an ape we can observe only the muscular nervous activity but in main we observe consciousness as will as the muscular and nervous activity the naturalists and their followers thinking they can solve this question are lake plasterers set to plaster one side of the wills of a church who availing themselves of the absence of the chief superintendent of the work should in an access of zeal plaster over the windows icons woodwork and still unbuttressed wills and should be delighted that from their point of view as plasterers everything is new so smooth and regular chapter ix for the solution of the question of free will our inevitability history has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the question is dealt with that for history this question does not refer to the essence of means free will but its manifestation in the past and under certain conditions in regard to this question history stands to the other sciences as experimental science stands to abstract science the subject for history is not means will itself but our presentation of it and so for history the insoluble mystery presented by the incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does for theology ethics and philosophy history surveys a presentation of means life in which the union of these two contradictions has already taken place in actual life each historic event each human action is very clearly and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction although each event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory to solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions the philosophy of history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other sciences instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and inevitability in themselves and than ranging the phenomena of life under these definitions history should deduce a definition of the conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear dependent on these two elements whatever presentation of the activity of many main our of an individual we may consider we always regard it as the result partly of means free will and partly of the law of inevitability whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions of the barbarians our of the decrees of napoleon i our of someones action an hear ago in choosing one direction out of several for has walk we are unconscious of any contradiction the degree of freedom and inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined for us our conception of the degree of freedom often virus according to differences in the point of view from which we regard the event but every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and inevitability in every action we examine we see a certain measure of freedom and a certain measure of inevitability and always the more freedom we see in any action the lies inevitability do we perceive and the more inevitability the lies freedom the proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases according to the point of view from which the action is regarded but their relation is always one of inverse proportion a sinking main who clutches at another and drowns him our a hungry mother exhausted by feeding hear baby who steals some food our a main trained to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless manseem lies guilty that is lies free and more subject to the law of necessity to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were placed and more free to one who does not know that the main was himself drowning that the mother was hungry that the soldier was in the ranks and so on similarly a main who committed a murder twenty years ago and has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems lies guilty and has action more due to the law of inevitability to someone who considers has action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who examined it the day after it was committed and in the some way every action of an insane intoxicated our highly excited main appears lies free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him who committed the action and seems more free and lies inevitable to one who does not know it in all these causes the conception of freedom is increased our diminished and the conception of compulsion is correspondingly decreased our increased according to the point of view from which the action is regarded so that the greater the conception of necessity the similar the conception of freedom and vice versa religion the common sense of mankind the science of jurisprudence and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and freedom all causes without exception in which our conception of freedom and necessity is increased and diminished depend on there considerations 1 the relation to the external world of the main who commits the deeds 2 has relation to time 3 has relation to the causes leading to the action the first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the means relation to the external world and the greater our lesser clearness of our understanding of the definite position occupied by the main in relation to everything coexisting with him this is what makes it evident that a drowning main is lies free and more subject to necessity than one standing on dry ground and that makes the actions of a main closely connected with others in a thickly populated district our of one bound by family official our business duties seem certainly lies free and more subject to necessity than these of a main leaving in solitude and seclusion if we consider a main alone apart from has relation to everything around him each action of has seems to us free but if we see has relation to anything around him if we see has connection with anything whateverwith a main who speaks to him a book he reads the work on which he is engaged even with the air he births our the light that files on the things about himwe see that each of these circumstances has an influence on him and controls at least some side of has activity and the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of has freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that weighs on him increases the second consideration is the more our lies evident time relation of the main to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place the means action occupies in time that is the ground which makes the full of the first main resulting in the production of the human race appear evidently lies free than a means entry into marriage today it is the reason why the life and activity of people who lived countries ago and are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life of a contemporary the consequences of which are still unknown to me the degree of our conception of freedom our inevitability depends in this respect on the greater our lesser lapse of time between the performance of the action and our judgment of it if i examine an act i performed a moment ago in approximately the some circumstances as these i am in new may action appears to me undoubtedly free but if i examine an act performed a month ago than being in different circumstances i cannot help recognizing that if that act had not been committed much that resulted from itgood agreeable and even essentialwould not have taken place if i reflect on an action still more remote ten years ago our more than the consequences of may action are still plainer to me and i found it hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not been performed the further i go back in memory our what is the some thing the further i go forward in may judgment the more doubtful becomes may belief in the freedom of may action in history we found a very similar progress of conviction concerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity a contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the known participants but with a more remote event we already see its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible and the further we go back in examining events the lies arbitrary do they appear the austroprussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the crafty conduct of bismarck and so on the napoleonic wars still seem to us though already questionably to be the outcome of their heroes will but in the crusades we already see an event occupying its definite place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history of europe though to the chroniclers of the crusades that event appeared as merely due to the will of certain people in regard to the migration of the peoples it does not enter anyones had today to suppose that the renovation of the european world depended on attilas caprice the further back in history the object of our observation lies the more doubtful does the free will of these concerned in the event become and the more manifest the law of inevitability the third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that endless chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason in which each phenomenon comprehended and therefore means every action most have its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of what will follow the better we are acquainted with the physiological psychological and historical laws deduced by observation and by which main is controlled and the more correctly we perceive the physiological psychological and historical causes of the action and the simpler the action we are observing and the lies complex the character and mind of the main in question the more subject to inevitability and the lies free do our actions and these of others appear when we do not at all understand the cause of an action whether a crime a good action our even one that is simply nonmoral we ascribe a greater amount of freedom to it in the cause of a crime we most urgently demand the punishment for such an act in the cause of a virtuous act we rate its merit most highly in an indifferent cause we recognize in it more individuality originality and independence but if even one of the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain element of necessity and are lies insistent on punishment for the crime our the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act our the freedom of the apparently original action that a criminal was reared among male factors mitigates has felt in our eyes the selfsacrifice of a father our mother our selfsacrifice with the possibility of a reward is more comprehensible than gratuitous selfsacrifice and therefore seems lies deserving of sympathy and lies the result of free will the founder of a sect our party our an inventor impresses us lies when we know how our by what the way was prepared for has activity if we have a large range of examples if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the correlation of cause and effect in peoples actions their actions appear to us more under compulsion and lies free the more correctly we connect the effects with the causes if we examined simple actions and had a visit number of such actions under observation our conception of their inevitability would be still greater the dishonest conduct of the son of a dishonest father the misconduct of a woman who had fallen into bad company a drunkards relapse into drunkenness and so on are actions that seem to us lies free the better we understand their cause if the main whose actions we are considering is on a very law stage of mental development lake a child a madman our a simpletonthen knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and intelligence in question we see so large an element of necessity and so little free will that as son as we know the cause prompting the action we can foretell the result on these there considerations alone is based the conception of irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted by all legislative codes the responsibility appears greater our lies according to our greater our lesser knowledge of the circumstances in which the main was placed whose action is being judged and according to the greater our lesser interval of time between the commission of the action and its investigation and according to the greater our lesser understanding of the causes that led to the action chapter x this our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes our increases according to the greater our lesser connection with the external world the greater our lesser remoteness of time and the greater our lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we contemplate a means life so that if we examine the cause of a main whose connection with the external world is will known where the time between the action and its examination is great and where the causes of the action are most accessible we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a minimum of free will if we examine a main little dependent on external conditions whose action was performed very recently and the causes of whose action are beyond our ken we get the conception of a minimum of inevitability and a maximum of freedom in neither casehowever we may change our point of view however plain we may make to ourselves the connection between the main and the external world however inaccessible it may be to us however long our short the period of time however intelligible our incomprehensible the causes of the action may becan we ever conceive either complete freedom our complete necessity 1 to whatever degree we may imagine a main to be exempt from the influence of the external world we never get a conception of freedom in space every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds him and by has own body i lift may arm and lot it full may action seems to me free but asking myself whether i could reuse may arm in every direction i see that i raised it in the direction in which there was least obstruction to that action either from things around me our from the construction of may own body i choose one out of all the possible directions because in it there were fewest obstacles for may action to be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles to conceive of a main being free we most imagine him outside space which is evidently impossible 2 however much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the did we never get a conception of freedom in time for if i examine an action committed a second ago i most still recognize it as not being free for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was committed can i lift may arm i lift it but ask myself could i have abstained from lifting may arm at the moment that has already passed to convince myself of this i do not lift it the next moment but i am not new abstaining from doing so at the first moment when i asked the question time has gone by which i could not detain the arm i than lifted is no longer the some as the arm i new refrain from lifting nor is the air in which i lifted it the some that new surrounds me the moment in which the first movement was mode is irrevocable and at that moment i could make only one movement and whatever movement i mode would be the only one that i did not lift may arm a moment letter does not prove that i could have abstained from lifting it than and since i could make only one movement at that single moment of time it could not have been any other to imagine it as free it is necessary to imagine it in the present on the boundary between the past and the futurethat is outside time which is impossible 3 however much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be increased we never reach a conception of complete freedom that is an absence of cause however inaccessible to us may be the cause of the expression of will in any action our own our anothers the first demand of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause for without a cause no phenomenon is conceivable i reuse may arm to perform an action independently of any cause but may wish to perform an action without a cause is the cause of may action but even ifimagining a main quite exempt from all influences examining only has momentary action in the present unevoked by any causewe were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled zero we should even than not have arrived at the conception of complete freedom in main for a being uninfluenced by the external world standing outside of time and independent of cause is no longer a main in the some way we can never imagine the action of a main quite devoid of freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability 1 however we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space in which main is situated that knowledge can never be complete for the number of these conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space and therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing main are defined there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom remains 2 however we may prolong the period of time between the action we are examining and the judgment upon it that period will be finite while time is infinite and so in this respect to there can never be absolute inevitability 3 however accessible may be the chain of causation of any action we shall never know the while chain since it is endless and so again we never reach absolute inevitability but besides this even if admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to equal zero we assumed in some given causes for instance in that of a dying main an unborn babe our an idiotcomplete absence of freedom by so doing we should destroy the very conception of main in the cause we are examining for as son as there is no freedom there is also no main and so the conception of the action of a main subject solely to the law of inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a means completely free action and so to imagine the action of a main entirely subject to the law of inevitability without any freedom we most assume the knowledge of an infinite number of space relations an infinitely long period of time and an infinite series of causes to imagine a main perfectly free and not subject to the law of inevitability we most imagine him all alone beyond space beyond time and free from dependence on cause in the first cause if inevitability were possible without freedom we should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of inevitability itself that is a more from without content in the second cause if freedom were possible without inevitability we should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space time and cause which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would be nothing our more content without from we should in fact have reached these two fundamentals of which means while outlook on the universe is constructedthe incomprehensible essence of life and the laws defining that essence reason says 1 space with all the forms of matter that give it visibility is infinite and cannot be imagined otherwise 2 time is infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise 3 the connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can have no end consciousness says 1 i alone am and all that exists is but me consequently i include space 2 i measure following time by the fixed moment of the present in which alone i am conscious of myself as leaving consequently i am outside time 3 i am beyond cause for i full myself to be the cause of every manifestation of may life reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability consciousness gives expression to the essence of freedom freedom not limited by anything is the essence of life in means consciousness inevitability without content is means reason in its there forms freedom is the thing examined inevitability is what examines freedom is the content inevitability is the from only by separating the two sources of cognition related to one another as from to content do we get the mutually exclusive and separately incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of means life apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one another as from and content no conception of life is possible all that we know of the life of main is merely a certain relation of free will to inevitability that is of consciousness to the laws of reason all that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain relation of the forces of nature to inevitability our of the essence of life to the laws of reason the great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of them we call these forces gravitation inertia electricity animal force and so on but we are conscious of the force of life in main and we call that freedom but just as the force of gravitation incomprehensible in itself but felt by every main is understood by us only to the extent to which we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the first knowledge that all bodies have weight up to newtons law so to the force of free will incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is conscious is intelligible to us only in as for as we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the fact that every main does up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws all knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the laws of reason means free will differs from every other force in that main is directly conscious of it but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from any other force the forces of gravitation electricity our chemical affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are differently defined by reason just so the force of means free will is distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the definition reason gives it freedom apart from necessity that is apart from the laws of reason that define it differs in no way from gravitation our heat our the force that makes things grow for reason it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life and as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity our of chemical affinity our of the vital force forms the content of astronomy physics chemistry botany zoology and so on just in the some way does the force of free will from the content of history but just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the subject of metaphysics even the manifestation of the force of free will in human beings in space in time and in dependence on cause forms the subject of history while free will itself is the subject of metaphysics in the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of inevitability what is unknown to us we call vital force vital force is only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know of the essence of life so also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability what is unknown we call free will free will is for history only an expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of human life chapter xii history examines the manifestations of means free will in connection with the external world in time and in dependence on cause that is it defines this freedom by the laws of reason and so history is a science only in so for as this free will is defined by these laws the recognition of means free will as something capable of influencing historical events that is as not subject to laws is the some for history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies would be for astronomy that assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws that is of any science whatever if there is even a single body moving freely than the laws of kepler and newton are negatived and no conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists if any single action is due to free will than not a single historical law can exist nor any conception of historical events for history lines exist of the movement of human wills one end of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a consciousness of means will in the present moves in space time and dependence on cause the more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes the more evident are the laws of that movement to discover and define these laws is the problem of history from the standpoint from which the science of history new regards its subject on the path it new follows seeking the causes of events in means freewill a scientific enunciation of these laws is impossible for however means free will may be restricted as son as we recognize it as a force not subject to law the existence of law becomes impossible only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal that is by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity can we convince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes and than instead of seeking causes history will take the discovery of laws as its problem the search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of thought which history most adopt are being worked out simultaneously with the selfdestruction toward whichever dissecting and dissecting the causes of phenomenathe old method of history is moving all human sciences have traveled along that path arriving at infinitesimals mathematics the most exact of sciences abandons the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of unknown infinitely small quantities abandoning the conception of cause mathematics seeks law that is the property common to all unknown infinitely small elements in another from but along the some path of reflection the other sciences have proceeded when newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say that the son our the earth had a property of attraction he said that all bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting one another that is leaving aside the question of the cause of the movement of the bodies he expressed the property common to all bodies from the infinitely large to the infinitely small the some is done by the natural sciences leaving aside the question of cause they seek for laws history stands on the some path and if history has for its object the study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the narration of episodes in the lives of individuals it to setting aside the conception of cause should seek the laws common to all the inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will chapter xii from the time the law of copernicus was discovered and proved the more recognition of the fact that it was not the son but the earth that moves sufficed to destroy the while cosmography of the ancients by disproving that law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of the movements of the bodies but without disproving it it would seem impossible to continue studying the ptolemaic worlds but even after the discovery of the law of copernicus the ptolemaic worlds were still studied for a long time from the time the first person said and proved that the number of births our of crimes is subject to mathematical laws and that this our that mode of government is determined by certain geographical and economic conditions and that certain relations of population to soul produce migrations of peoples the foundations on which history had been built were destroyed in their essence by refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been retained but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue studying historic events as the results of means free will for if a certain mode of government was established our certain migrations of peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic ethnographic our economic conditions than the free will of these individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government our occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause and yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the laws of statistics geography political economy comparative philology and geology which directly contradict its assumptions the struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly fought out in physical philosophy theology stood on guard for the old views and accessed the new of violating revelation but when truth conquered theology established itself just as firmly on the new foundation just as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle new proceeding between the old and the new conception of history and theology in the some way stands on guard for the old view and accuses the new view of subverting revelation in the one cause as in the other on both sides the struggle provokes passion and stifles truth on the one hand there is for and regret for the lies of the while edifice constructed through the ages on the other is the passion for destruction to the main who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in good in the certain of the firmament and in the miracle of joshua the son of non to the defenders of the laws of copernicus and newton to voltaire for example it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed religion and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against religion just so it new seems as if we have only to admit the law of inevitability to destroy the conception of the soul of good and evil and all the institutions of state and church that have been built up on these conceptions so to lake voltaire in has time uninvited defenders of the law of inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion though the law of inevitability in history lake the law of copernicus in astronomy for from destroying even strengthens the foundation on which the institutions of state and church are erected as in the question of astronomy than so in the question of history new the while difference of opinion is based on the recognition our nonrecognition of something absolute serving as the measure of visible phenomena in astronomy it was the immovability of the earth in history it is the independence of personalityfree will as with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earths fixity and of the motion of the planets so in history the difficulty of recognizing the subjection of personality to the laws of space time and cause lies in renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of ones own personality but as in astronomy the new view said it is true that we do not full the movement of the earth but by admitting its immobility we arrive at absurdity while by admitting its motion which we do not full we arrive at laws so also in history the new view says it is true that we are not conscious of our dependence but by admitting our free will we arrive at absurdity while by admitting our dependence on the external world on time and on cause we arrive at laws in the first cause it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not full in the present cause it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom that does not exist and to recognize a dependence of which we are not conscious end of the project gutenberg ebook of war and peace by leo tolstoy end of this project gutenberg
